C'mon, you're going out with the guy
Sounds like a date to me
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone
Instead of
That's right
Never had that dream
No
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring
And they weren't looking at you before
Are you okay, sweetie
No you don't
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me
And you never knew she was a lesbian
No

Sorry
I don't want to be single, okay

My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-

That's right
Shut up
What are you talking about
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny
Stay out of my freezer
What
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date
Isn't there

Two years
Wow
That is amazing
Congratulations

Hello, Paul

Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar
What's that supposed to mean
Nothing
Don't listen to your mother

You are just like Jack
Jack from downstairs

Ah, the other Jack
Yeah, right
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow
But see, it was a plan
Floopy

Do you have a plan
I don't even have a 'pl'
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks
Yeah, that sounds about right
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit
And-and a power tie
No, pretty much just a towel
I see pizza
Oh, him, the little guy
Ooh, wait
Please tell me it's his mother
Definitely not his mother
Oh, no
Yeah
Oh
Oh please, they're having sex
Shut up
So, whaddya think George is like
I think he's shy
Yeah
Yeah
Look, it's just a little more complicated
Well, what
It was my first time
You'd already broken up
How long
A couple hours
Oh, that's nice
Where
Right- where we've been looking all night
He is so cute
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel
I think it's great
Really
Fun
Not that big a deal
Come on
We can
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get
Not a one
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again
Oh, yeah, yeah
That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs
You don't say
Who
Me
Don't you have a laundry room in your building
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a
Bob
What
We're just friends

Nuh-uh
Yuh-huh
So what're you saying here
There you go
Yep
Which

You've never met Bob, have you
No, but he's
This is nice
It's great
Eww, I don't wanna do that
Ok, have a good break-up
What
That's great
Yeah, it was really hard
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal
Ok, you weren't there
Oh, 'scuse me
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not
But I saved it
Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket
What
No suds, no save
Hi, uh, nothing
Was your basket on top
Yeah, but, there were no suds
So
Well, you know, no suds, no save
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh
Cleveland
How, how did that happen
Oh my god
What
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling
Yep
You're a lucky man
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it
Yeah, isn't he
Wow
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red
Except it didn't
What
Hello
Close
Oh my god, what were you thinking
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok
Really
Yeah
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry
Ow
I'm fine
All right
Wait here
It's like a gift
We should always always break up together
Oh, I'd like that
Oh, I guess
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules
Let go
I could not have done this without you
No
Yeah
Does it still hurt
Yeah
Hey, how'd it go
Excellent
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves
What a beautiful story
No, ten o'clock
What
Well, go over to her
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be
Oh please, could she be more out of my league
Thank you, buddy
Y'think
Yeah
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this
C'mon
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad
Based on this play
Hey
Alright
We talked 'til like two
All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is
'We' would be me and Rick
Who's Rick

My husband
Ooooohhh
Oh, so you're divorced
No
No, I'm still married
Ethan
Mmmm
What
Hm
Oh

Oh, yeah
We're kidding
Yeah
Alright
Look
Well, whaddya think
Very clean
Oh
How-how did that happen
I dunno
You guys, I am not that bad
Oh c'mon
Because you're a kook
I could do that
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table
Well, what's the part
Can you believe this
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in
You're right, you're right, it is
Whaddya think
Oh my God
He's in the bathroom
Lose the robe
Me
That would work
Well, I'm- I'm showering
No, that was clenching
Oh
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch
Thank you
No, actually I meant my fingers
Don't go
Okay
It's not Rick
What, Ethan
No, it's-it's Andrew
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us
So what do you want
You
You have me
Nono, just you
Whaddyou mean
Lose the other guys
Like,
C'mon, we're great together, why not
Why can't we just have what we have now
Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know
So
The second guy
No
Oh
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it
Something so sweet and
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years
Maybe this wasn't your shot
Yeah, I mean
Hard to tell, I was naked
No, I don't think this was your shot
Night
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here
Hey, it's me
OK, I'll go
Whoooaa
That's my sister

Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality
Yes
The doctor says it's a matter of hours
How-how are you, Mom
Me
What
What's different
Nothing
Oh, maybe that's it
Okay, relax, relax
Not just restaurants, from our house
I know
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed
What
She's not- past, she's present, she's back
She may have died
We're looking into it
Twice
Twice
Oh, that sucks
You guys okay
I dunno, it's weird
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone
Nono, she's gone
We checked
Sure
Dad
Listen to me
You what
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun
Define fun
C'mon, you'll make a day of it
And then we throw your body in the water
That's probably what they'll say
I'd like that
Oh
So, uh
I dunno, uh
Quality, right, great
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple
Lowell
Well, yeah
No
Excuse me
I have shown you everything we have
You're right
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier
Mm
No
Is everything all right, dear
Yeah, just
Some days it's all I can think about
What'd I say
Yes
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or
No, it's the pre-game
Oh, I hope they're not ruined
God, what a great day
What, what is it
You missed a belt loop
Oh
I feel great
You
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at
Huh
More wine, dear
Oh, I think so
That little naked guy would be me
Aww, look at the little thing
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis
Who are those people
Got me
Good, good
I know
Really
Yeah
So- you can tell
Pretty much, most of the time
Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no
He is
Yes, they are
I am not wrong
You're wrong
No, I just talked to them
Hey
Hey
And this from the cry-for-help department
Yes, I am
You know those posters for the city free clinic
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"
You know, the asthma guy was really cute
Do you know which one you're gonna be
Thanks
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, well it was
Well, I'm off to Carol's
Ooh, ooh
No, she's at a faculty meeting
Come in
Thanks
Kinda like a big face without skin
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there
You're not serious, I mean, you really
Yeah, all the time
Do you uh, do you talk about me
Yeah, yeah, all the time
Really
Oh, I believe it
We all chipped in
All right, I'm nine years old
Oh, I hate this story
Yes
We did
I gotta tell you
Get out
I'm serious
Ooh, you smell great tonight
I just remembered, I have to do something
Oh
Um, leave
Wait, wait, wait
Saw what
No, we were just laughing
All right, that's it
Oh, you must stop shooping
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff
But my mom always makes them
All right, fine
Ok, Mom never hit
No, no, the actual cartoon character
I can't, I gotta go
Come on
Almost never
Got the keys
Ok
So don't do it, it's fine
We're waiting for you to open the door
No I don't
Yes, you do
No I didn't
Do either of you have the keys
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key
Well then get it, get it
That tone will not make me go any faster
Oh, please
Does it always, uh--
No, no that was the first
Keep singing
Can you go any faster with that
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway
No, I didn't
Aside from the fact that you said you had them
But I didn't
Well, you should have
Why
Because
Why
Because
Hey, we all had better plans
Oh, really
Now this feels like Thanksgiving
What
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven
Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing
It's nice that he has someone
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese
Ooh, you guys have to make a wish
Make a wish
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving
The bigger half
I'd like to propose a toast
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas
And a crappy New Year
Here, here
W-wait
No, no, I don't
Oh, he is precious
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab
Why don't you just get a roommate
Might wanna open with the snowman
So, how'd it go
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job
How could you not get it
I dunno
Yeah, okay
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm
Woooo
Just a smidge
Me too
Yeah
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with
No, no, no, no, no, no
C'mon, this was a pact
I snapped, okay
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped
Do you always have to bring him here
I didn't wanna leave him alone
Oh, that'd be great
Yuh
Um, were you planning on kissing me ever
Right
Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella

Really
Yeah, we played, we watched TV

Looks like that no date pact thing worked out
Everybody looks so happy
Not everybody's happy
I can't kiss anyone
So I'm kissing everyone
Alright, somebody kiss me
We are not going to whistle
Come on, do it
No
Do it
No
Do it do it do it
I wish we at least knew his name
Oh
I know
He doesn't have anyone
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible
C'mon, she's your mom
Exactly
You can say that because she's not your mom
Oh, please
Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire
Hey hey hey

At the coffeehouse, right

Forget about her
He's right, man
Course there, they just call it food
I know
Well, not so good
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her
What do you mean
Y'know, just be there for her
Think about it
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die
It was like months ago
I can't believe he did this
I know
No it's not
Nuh-uh
I think this is so great
From here to the airport

Does he not make enough money
No, I'm just
Maybe there's someone else
Wha
Is there
No
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother
Shhhh
So how'd it go
Oh, it was amazing
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me
I didn't know you had another level
I know
Yeah
Oh, from who
From you
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him
It's me, Carl
C'mon up
Alright, you did it
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh
Really
Would you excuse me, please
Fine, just stop thinking about me
So I'm thinking about you
I don't get it
Well
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up
Well, start looking
Exactly

As much as he needs
Ok, I got one, I got one

Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur
You went shopping for fur
Oh, I got that for him
I licked my arm, what
It's breast milk
So
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk
You won't even taste it
No
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it
They took Ben to the park
Just out
That is an excellent excellent question
Judy
Who
Julie
What
Jody
You were with Julie
Oh
Honey, wait
Yeah, right
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here
Why'd you freak out
Because it's breast milk
No, no, Carol
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh
Cantaloupe juice
Exactly
Oh, you've tasted it
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true
You're damn right I'm right
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening
I feel terrible, I really do
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife
It's that terrible
Ready
Yeah, I'm ready
I'm sorry
Sure
So

What can we do for you
All right, kids
He didn't have any
Ok, so let's talk money
All right, there was none
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
Check this out
How can you not believe in evolution
Just don't
You bet
See, I didn't know that
Well, there you go
Huh

It was unbelievable
So what'd you do
Well, I couldn't do it
Good for you

Hi
Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody
Oh
Hey
Hey, Julie
Um, oh, I don't know
So how did everything go
Oh, great
Ok
Oh, you and me
Uh, no, Susan and me
The other us
Ok
We're uh, we're getting married
Look I just thought that
No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you
Mmm hmmm
Want us to go
Uh-huh
It really hit me last night
I am really not going
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever
Yeah, and she's really nice too
I'm sorry, what
What
Nice
That's great
Excellent
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something
All right, all right
Oh, yeah
Oh, hello
Oh, thanks
Is everything ok
Um, no, huh-uh
Oh my god
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get
Yeah, it's just so strange
I think it went into me
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf
Oh god
Sweetie
Pretty much
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink
Believe me, sometimes that happens
This is just so exciting
Really
Yes
I know who it is you remind me of
For
Well, not just for you
Well, what do you mean
I'm uh, considering leaving your father
Why
And you had no idea they weren't getting along
None
They didn't fight a lot
No
I just can't believe this is happening
That's him
Damn
Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting
Um, do you wanna sit
Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up
Yeah
Everything
Whoa, that's a lot of stuff
These are from Halloween three years ago
Oh, look, here's Barry
No, that was his costume
If you want
God
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food
That's fine
Oh
The only man I've ever been with is your father
You want me to talk you out of it
No
Then what
I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this
Why on earth would I understand this
You didn't marry your Barry
Oh
All right people, we're in trouble here
Do you want me to cry
Sir
Hey
How's it going
What's the matter
Nothing
What
You're still gonna pay me, right
Carol, what's the matter
My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming
Oh my god
It's ok
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right
You do
Look, do you love her
Well then that's it
You're right
So we're back on
We're back on
You heard the woman
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok
Yeah, can't help but
Oh, yeah

Zoo dollars

Hmm, Lipson knows huh
Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field
This is unbelievable

No
First of all, it's on your ass
Well then, what is it
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work

So, what's up
Umm, wow

We appear to have angered it
We
Oops

It got caught on my watch
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about
Oh, right
There's one thing missing
What's that
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion
My parents will be so happy

Hmm, let me see
How'd it go with Pete
Tell us
You're not gonna believe this
What's the matter
I have a feelin'
Well y'know, he's got access
Yeah
Y'know it's that feeling you get, y'know
Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes
That's the one
What happened
It's me, I've been sleeping with your wife
He didn't ask me to marry him
Ohh
Well then definately don't take his name
He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy
Pete
Why
I don't know exactly
'They're are no rules
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking
What's fish hooking
Yeah
Umm, my friend, Bonnie
You remember her from my birthday party two years ago
I promise
Hey, are we still on for tonight
Yeah
How 'bout just a boom
How could you not tell me that she has hair
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people
Well, maybe it won't work out
We never get smacked
Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me
From New York City, New York
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it
What, look back
Well, you're not gonna get going are you
Well let me ask you a question
Well, no
Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out
Let me tell you a story
Look, I'm gonna get better
Oh, about five minutes
No, I-I'm saying I liked her
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea
Okay, I hear you
Oh, you forgot
No, no I just ah, didn't do them
Hmm
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself
No, no
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment
Oh no
You said she was bald
What
Okay, first of all, breathe
Yes
So
Oh, we killed them all
Oh
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter
Everybody else got one, and you want one too
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do

You made a joke right
Ha-ha-ha

Come on see, she doesn't look that bad
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head

Good, so do I
Something to do with numbers

Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews
Now

Come on, that was back in high school
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip
Look, you and I went to different high schools
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school
Yeah
No you don't
Yes, I do
No you do - y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right
Pretty nice
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this
We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it
You gotta take the canoe
Yes, we have to tell her
Oh, but it's made her so happy
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong
You think
Oh-no, he's right

Jeez

Amy Welch

Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school
Oh honey, I'm sorry

Ohh
That's a good call
No

Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink
What is she doing here
Oh, come on
Thank you

Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her
Let me ask you a question
Hmm
Why did you hire me
What
Your nails
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones
It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars
What
You bet that I'd screw up
No-no-no, that was all true
No, I have faith
No, we are
Okay
No, no, that was my boss

Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting
Y'know why
Yeah
A couple of hours, I feel awful
Look, this isn't funny
I can't
Why not
I'm in my boss's car
What
I did break up with her
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind
It did enter my mind
You never come into this office again
Fine
You give me back my Walkman
I - never borrowed your Walkman
Well, then I lost it
About what
He cut off his ear
And

Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me
Oh

My drinking

Said what
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait
Say more things like that
You can have your own office, and a raise
Done
And an assistant
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'

I can't believe he didn't come
So what if he didn't come
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night
Yeah
Well, we could do that
There's other stuff too
We'll do it all, and better
Yeah
Yeah

And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again
Yeah
All right
Ohh, you've waited soo long
You got the job
I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's

And I gotta pay rent
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in
I'm not Jewish, so
I wasn't sleeping
So, did you pick one yet
Y'know, you're right
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague
Prague
There's sooo much you don't know
You idiot
I'm sure you're right, but why
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship
Oh, man
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people
I know
Yeah
What
You did a minute ago
Well, I don't know what to tell ya
Fine
That's not funny
Well that's not true
You bet I do

Cool, girl roommate
Nope, not knocked up yet

That's right
Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop
So umm, you feel like taking a test

People can hear you

Yeah
Hi
That is one good looking man
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat
Sooo, you've been doing this long

Well, at least that's a great suit
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there
Here she comes
Hey you guys
Hey

Okay, so let me just get this straight
Well, you can understand, given how we started

Uh, hello
Hi-e
Ooh, what do I smell
I don't know, it smells good
Oh, yumm
Cookies and porn, you're the best mom ever

Hey
Oh, yeah, totally
Really
Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on
He just got a divorce right
Hmm-mmm
So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know
Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before
I don't even know how I would go about it
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too
Absolutely
No, sorry
All right, maybe I should call her
No
He's right, what she did was unforgivable
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong
How might you be wrong
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy
Dude, tell me she actually told you this
Oh
Great
All right, thank you so much for all your help
Sure
Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it
Ah, that's okay, thanks
Okay
Really
Hi

Because, I-I should've called
Will you call him
What's Phase Two
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club
How does going to a strip club help him better

Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women
There are naked ladies there too

Then you go to Tokyo
All right look, forget it, forget it
It is not over

Well
Of course there's another guy

Yeah
We have free porn here

Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour
That's Carol with your son
Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand
Me too

So, have you kids eaten yet
Well, we were going to do that after - I mean umm, next
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat
Oh, yeah, well
Yes
You'll wear that
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name
It's not that bad
Yes it is
So, you're just Bing
I have no name
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off
Umm, Gene

Do you remember where the duck food is

You may kiss the bride
Okay
Well, that went well
It could've been worse, he could've shot her
Hey
Seven times
Ugh
In a foreign, romantic country
I blame London
Only here
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs
I'll meet you there in two minutes
Okay

The man's got a point

Okay
You didn't find her
No, I've looked everywhere
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her
Yeah, I think you should keep looking
Yeah, for about 30 minutes
Or 45
Yeah, we're gonna go
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while
You can forget about Emily, she's not with us
We've come for her things
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she
She's in hiding
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey

Oh
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh
Not yet
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave
Yeah
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this
Same difference
No, you know what, I think you should go

Good

Oh
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too
Uh, The Wheatsheaf
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer
Ohh
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center
No, but she likes me
So you still hadn't heard from Emily
No, not since I lost her at the airport
I can't believe she can out run you man
That's it
Well, yeah
Oh that's not true
Yes it is
That's fine
Sweetie
You're going to talk to him
No
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that
See, didn't I tell you
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow
Oh, good
That's not European
Well, it felt French
Yeah
Okay
Okay, yeah
Hi
She's doing her laundry
Oh, it's not so bad
I can't catch a break
I make the decisions, and I say no
I really need to talk to you
Well, then talk
Okay, I will
Yes
What thing
But I
Please
All right, fine
That sucks
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth
Mine
Wait
Nooo, I said we needed a new plan
And, I came up with Atlantic City
Which, is the new plan
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour
Okay
No
Yeah, what's it about
Events from around the globe
Okay
Sure
Okay
Go ahead
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily
That is what the thing is
No
Atlantic City
Atlantic City, baby
Ohh

That's all right
Hi, yeah, hi
Not yet
Well
Oh my God
It's all right
That's right

Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head
Oh my God, she's so stupid

All right - Ooh
What
I'm having my first contraction
Oh no
Ooh, it's not bad
Okay
Ooh, something hurts
Are they
That's what it sounded like
All right
They're male nurses
Not in my head
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night
Harder than it sounds
Really
Yeah, I was bummed too
So they're going on dates
Let's see what we got here
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor
Oh no-no-no
It's very weird
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse
Hi
Umm, well, what else could it be
It's kidney stones
Or
Kidney stones
They are
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday
Happy birthday
Yeah
Can I tell you a little secret
Yeah
Why not
Yes
Maybe not
Oh, just ask him
Me
I can't ask him
No
You're right
Well, maybe a little
Me too
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here
Fonzie met Mork
Yeah, that's right
Hi
Hello Dan
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh

Oh, honey, don't worry
Yeah
Yeah
Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one
I see the head
Yes, it has a head
All right
I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now
All right
Yes
Frank Jr
Oh, how does he look
I already had a baby
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it
All right, he's coming
They musta read the sonogram wrong
We have our babies
Yeah
You did it, man
Great
I think you're better than you think you are
Really
Which one do you have
I don't care
Yeah, umm, no honey
Oh
Yeah, sure yeah
I know
So does it really hurt as bad as they say
Yeah
Works on you
Well, we were
Well no, not yet
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned
Vomit tux
What's wrong with PBS
Ugh, what's right with them
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs
All I got was a lousy key chain
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV
Whoa
What-what are you talking about
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish
Well, may I ask for one example
Yeah, it's
Are you calling me selfish
No wait
Look you're my wife
I miss you to
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man
Ohh, he's really shy
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet
I don't care
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship
Yes
That's great
In London
What
She wants me to move to London
That's great
No you answer it and take pledges
But I'm the host
No, Gary Collins is the host
You don't seem to understand
I will find a selfless good deed
Yeah, would you please consider moving here
I don't know, it's just
All right
All right, did you just say all right
I did
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her
All right
Oh that is so great
Ooh-ohh
Great
No-no-no
What
Yeah
That's true
No, you cannot
Why
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man
Come on man
Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh
Ooh, it's not a toy
And you don't a little good about donating the money
No, it sucks
A hamster
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on
I mean I was nothing before you
Really
Oh-aw my God
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves
Okay
Y'know that wasn't part of it
I know
Sure
It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff
Like what
Just stuff
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help
No
Well, I-I know you can do that too
Thanks
Nope
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly
I know, me too
Hey
No, she's out shopping
Damn
What's going on
I told Emily to come
I have no idea
Uh, hey
What's going on
Yeah that's better than my way
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog
It's Le Poo
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better
You're nose is bleeding
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore
Yeah, I know
We're switching rooms again
What
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room
What did you say
Hey
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants
Yeah
is for me not to see you anymore
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been
Oh yeah, really
What are you doing
Hey
How was your conference
Yeah
300 dollars
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room
You want my advice
Yes
You're not gonna like it
That's okay
You got married to fast
That's not advice
I told ya
Maybe I could do it
Hey
Hey
Hey, you're not Kip
Oh, that poor bastard
See
You're not gonna be phased out
Honey, come on
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there
Yes that would have made more sense
Wherever I go
Hi
No, it's not better
Well, what-what would you do
I know
I am so sorry
I know that too
I just came over to drop off
Yeah, it did
So, I guess this is over
What
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime
Why, exactly
Because of the weekend, we had a fight
Okay
Hey
How
It happened in London
IN LONDON
Please
I know, it's great
Count for what
Fun's over
Wait-wait, guys
Uh-huh

Sorry

Crematorium Chris

No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples
So, rocks
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
You do have a choice
Why
We all hate Emily
Nooo
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable
Yes
I kinda feel like it's my fault
So you like the short hair better
What
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell
Oh
Absolutely
Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog
So from that you think you've got me all figured out
Okay
I'm hungry
Okay
Stop saying that
Yep
Oh good
Y'know what
Whatever you decide, whatever you do
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song
Look, this is hard enough
Yes
Okay

Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him
Okay, oh, here's what you do
What do you mean
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe
Of course it did
You brought a carrot
What
This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot
You brought a carrot
Oh my God
God, I'm sorry
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound
Without my toe
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast
Oh, I'm not falling for that one
Present Day
I didn't mean to cut it off
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot
I'm sorry
Nothing
No I didn't
Yes, you did
No I didn't
You love me

Help

Oh, I read that in high school
This is going to be so much fun
Someone at work ate my sandwich
Well, what did the police say
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food
Really
Well how would you know
What do you think
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers
Would ya care to venture one
Would you care to venture one
Are you just repeating what I'm saying
Are you just repeating what I'm saying
All right, let's move on
Okay then
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid
So you uh, still wondering
No, we just went out
You're smart
Yeah
Well, I'm telling everyone about you
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet
Okay, just wait, please
Yeah, of course, Donald
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part
What
Oh no, you-you don't understand
I-I'm sorry
You ate my sandwich
It was a simple mistake
Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind
Hi
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else
What
Fine
A cyborg
Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots
Why
On account of my rage
Which I may say, right now, is out of control
He gave me a pill for it
A pill
Uh-huh
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work
And you're okay with that
I don't know
Well, I snapped
Well, yeah
You get away from me
All right, look
No
Yes you are
No it isn't
Well, what is the truth
Yeah, what's going on
What's going on
Oh no
You slept with my sister
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London
Yes it's true
No
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself
That makes sense
And the video camera
What can I say
Yeah
Wow
I'm making change
But, can't you leave the dollar
I'm poor
I'm sorry, man
Or that
I can't write
I'll help you
Really
Yeah
Thanks
Or Joseph
Well, you should be, this is all your fault
Why
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff
Okay, I'll stop
Don't stop
You wanna play
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts
So did I
Nice to meet you
Like it would help
Does it look like an ashtray
No
Yeah, good for you
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something

Okay, see
They're brother and sister
Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner
That chick can't handle my corner
Look, either you leave, or we remove you

Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and
Oh great
Do-do you, do you have brothers
No, I have two sisters
Are you close with them
No-no, they're not very nice people
Okay, listen, I really like you
What is up
About yesterday, I was really wrong
No, it was me
What
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know
All right, I'll take care of it
Oh no, wait
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister
Well, who's gonna kiss my sister
Yeah
All right

So

Let them win one
Are you crazy
They have racquets don't they
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game
It was my racquet
I was frustrated with you
Maybe we should check the trash chute
There he is
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there
What were you doing
I uh, went to a bar
You walked around all night in the city by yourself
He hooked up
Yeah
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me
You two will have very hairy children
Okay, I didn't know you would say that
Look, I didn't lose my mind
So are you actually gonna see her again
I am gonna see her again

What is wrong now
This isn't what I ordered
No-no-no, no
Huh
OH
Are you gonna be okay
I am now
Okay
Okay
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free
All right
That was a half an hour
All right, then massage me up right nice
It's so good, isn't it
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it
Say good-bye to sore muscles
Good-bye muscles
Great
Hey
Is everything okay
Are you all right
Oh yeah, no-no-no
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now
It's okay
It's not a purse
It looks like a women's purse
No
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that
Umm, yeah - no thanks
Umm, well, umm Grandma died
Wow
No, she just died today
Okay, I know that I went to that all ready
No you didn't
Well, then who's been dead for five years
Well, lots of people
Umm, no
Hey
What
Your make-up
Hey, don't listen to them
Hey, how are you holding up
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine
Umm here's your 3-D glasses
So how did you know Francis
Really
What
What happened
That was my dad
Oh my God
Uh-huh
Wh-what did he say
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here
What did you say to him
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now
Okay
All right, let's go say good-bye
And a date with a man
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry
All right
What are you talking about
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone
I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww
You've been lying to me
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings
Well, first it's not a purse
Okay, anytime
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not
Noooo
Okay
Yeah but I didn't read anything
I think we've seen enough
I'm not crying about that
What
Oh my God
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world
I'm crying here
Okay, hear me out
Huh
Okay
Thank you
Okay
So, what did Francis leave me
Huh
Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right
Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note
But you-you-you came to see Lilly
Yeah, yeah
She's dead
Are you sure
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake
I can't believe this
17 years ago
Oh
That's a defense
Yes
Hey man, how did the audition go
Nooooo
Y'know what
I can't believe I'm hearing this
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt
And we're done with the chicken fried rice
Hey
Good idea
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man
It's amazing
OH
NO
I KNOW
YOU KNOW
Yes, I know
Nothing
Oh
What
No-no-no
No
Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate
Okay
And then
Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie
Hey
Really
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too
What's going on
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny
Okay, now you're even cuter
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say
What
Ow
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her
This bicep
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry
Oh
Okay
No-no, I got the edge
That new mountain bike
No
Well what did you send
A basket of mini-muffins
The small one
What
Well yeah
Your work makes me sad
Bye
Bye
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me
Ohhh, oh my God
Are you serious
Them
Oh man
I'm sorry
No
Huh
I'm listening
Well, he had gravity boots
Yeah, he broke those too
So he likes to break stuff
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming
No
Ugh, I knew it
Oh yeah
All right
Yes
Good
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do
How do you know
Because you're on my team
At this
Me
No, I want this to happen
So do I
Thanks
Really
Oh, do you not want to
No
She's bluffing
Okay
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss
Here it comes
And why not
Well I am that
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum
Oh, I'm going on the lamb
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps
Oh
Ooh, I'll go in on that with you
Okay
Hi
So, are you ready to go

Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes
Howard's the handy man
Yes but too me he's just, man
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you
Well, because she loves you and because you love her
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean
No, you're right, you are absolutely right
Okay
Not unless different means the same
Hmm
Yeah, I'm cool
I'm just hanging out
Man, I knew it
What
Oh and you know what I want

Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking
Umm, cups
What's up
That's it
Well, you just

What
At least I care about his feelings
What
Oh, come on
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid
You just give him a spoon baby
Oh yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Thanks
No, I'm-I'm serious
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking
I did not
Yes you did
All right, fine
I wish I had smoked for my career
Well then let's just quit
It does sound appealing
Oh, I never could do it
Oh but you could
Oh y'know, we really should quit
Is there a problem
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup
Oh, what did I say
Hmm, noodle soup
Okay
Okay
Y'know what
Uh-oh, busted
Come on you guys
Yeah
No

That's the surprise
Oh my God
Wow

I think, sub-consciously
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me
Thank you
No
Eh, what are you gonna do
Okay, great
Hey
Wow

Ugh, I hate it
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting
It's uh, 27 dollars even
Oh, he's in the back
What
The flirting
Yeah, right
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him
Don't get me started on that
And on your anniversary, for shame
What's going on
Well I'm sorry but you were
Well

Okay, y'know what
See
This is so cool
The one that doesn't
That was some hot love you gave me
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you
That's a great idea
Okay
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay
Great
Oh what, you-you want both of them
Tell her to wear her own earrings
These are her earrings
Nooo
Why not
Because I lose her stuff
It's a diaper commercial
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh
Hi
One uh, vegetarian pizza
Oh

You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys
Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money
You couldn't let me have her, could ya
What
This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there
What's goin' on
Really
Really
It's no big deal, I do it all the time
Okay, but there is a big difference
And thank you, for that
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about
On your dresser
Okay that is the one we already have
No you didn't
No, that would be, "Why are you being cute
Okay, I'm working on my flirting
Ohh
Go on, teach me something about men and women
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever
No way
It's true
Well that's pathetic
Again true
And this goes for all guys
All guys that are awake
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault
Ohh that'd be great
Mon, can I talk to you for a sec
Yeah, what is it
Umm, I lost one of your earrings

Definitely
Not as each other
Oh, then no
You ready

You look amazing
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier
Let me see the earrings
Oh, honey, the earrings

It's called the cherry
Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce
Yep

Half the taste is in the smell
Okay
Yeah, what's that like
I need a few more things to make the margaritas
So all we have is ice
See if he has ice
Okay
Yeah, no one talks like that
Oh what

Is everything okay
What's going on
Okay, he sees us
Hi
No, wait
There's nothing we can do
Yeah well unless we tell him
Right

And it could've just as easily have been a bullet
Who jumps at loud noises
Wow
Okay
All right
Bye
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room
Is something wrong
No
Okay
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing
Well, no, not exactly
From a bullet
I know it doesn't make much sense
Much sense
Really
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me
What
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right
Yeah
And somebody took a shot at me
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right
Huh

You weren't there

Tonight, but don't say anything

So, what are you gonna do
I don't know
Me

I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know
Yeah
What the hell is that

{Oh, all right
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work
How do you know
Really
Check it out
I don't want a cat
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat
Yeah
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing
Yes I did, and I think you should do it
What
He's a great guy, y'know
You are useless
Yeah
Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward
Uh-hmm

I want you to move in with me
That is so sweet
That's right baby
He's a dropper
Oh yeah, that's right
I'm not a dropper
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know

I'm sick of the signs
Me too
I don't want things to change
No
All right then, then nothing changes
Well, what if all my stuff was here
Live together
Me asking is kind of a sign
YES
Okay
Okay

Oh, so that's this is gonna work now
Pretty much
All right
I have some pretty exciting news
Hey
What's up
Y'know that's really fair
What
No
Hey
Ugh, the worse day
What
Really
And that was so sweet of you to ask
Well the divorces don't bother me, I'd date him
We were drunk
I am so attracted to him right now
You just said
These aren't for you
I am now
Um-hmm
Hi
Yes
So that's your second marriage in two years
Yes, second in two years
Oh, that's better then
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled
I see
I think just the annulment for today
There are a couple of forms to fill out
Easy
Hey
Y'know, no point in dragging it out
Something to remember me by
Mon, honey you're not dying
But still, it's a big change
Are you okay
Oh, all right
What is the matter with you
What is the matter with you
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me
What's hard to believe
Well y'know, it's you guys
No-no, wait
It is
Yeah, sweetie
I know
So
I couldn't
I knew it
I
I've never been more convinced of your love for her
Of course
Really
Wow
I know
But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful
Oh
how about I move in with you
Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise
Who's Denise
My roommate
You have a roommate
Yes, Denise
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say
Yeah, why don't you move in with me
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place
Hey-hey
Hey
You didn't tell her did you
No
Of course not, because you're in love with her
I am not in love with her
What do you mean, comforted her
It's nothing, I just gave her a hug
Ah-ha
It's also a sign of friendship
S-s-smell her hair
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right
Well, I like that idea
No
Oh, I'm sorry
So, that's it
You're just staring into space
That sounds great
I saw it
I don't know what you're talking about
Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit
Look, I do not re-love her
What
What
What
Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out
Hero, I uh, I don't know - well, all right
Hi
Yeah
Ohh
Totally
Oh good
Hey, y'know what
Changes
Is that a problem
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together
Oh, that's cool
See now-now you're taking them away from their home
Okay, I get it
In the game room
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly
Whoa
Hey
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room
What
That's laughter
Why do you do it
I don't know
Okay
No-no, I'm staying put
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment
Why, where are you going
I don't know
Oh wow
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again
Yeah
Well, because of us
No
No
No
Good
Yeah
Ohh
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay
Yeah, no, me neither
Of course
Come here, I want to show you something
Okay

Uh-hmm
Y'know
Oh my God
Really
Uh, no
No, the other thing

Ehh, I don't, I don't think so
That's not gonna work out
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right
Is that what I want
All right, well the place was closed
Come in
Okay
Fight
Very good
String
Excellent

Hi
Hey
Oh, what's the matter
Well, you know that psychic I see
Yeah
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you
I don't - she said y'know that I'd have triplets
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go
Open with a joke
Wait a minute, hold the phone
Some uh, some visual aides
Oh-ooh-ooh
Why not
I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19
Hey
All right
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me
I loved them
Hey
How'd the lecture go
It went great
That's right
Really
Yeah
Oh well, no harm, no foul
Estelle, you gotta get me some work
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control
Why
What
What's wrong with you
Nothing
This sounds like a hernia
Look, I was nervous
Yeah, and not a very good one
Will you-will you please
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture
Hey
Hey
What's going on
Sure, now I'm scared
No, we can go together
Yeah, but I don't wanna die
No-no, it'll be fun
No
You stole them from me
You stole them from me
Gimme them
Yeah that seems fair
Why don't you phase it out
They're not listening too me
Of course they're listening to you
Exactly
Yes
Really
Yes
Listen to this
Really
Because my psychic is dead
Oh, I'm sorry
Eh, better her than me
Yeah
Okay
All right, from the top
Scene 5, take 2
All right
Hey-hey-hey
What are you doing
Look I was going to tell you
You're kidding
Yeah, it's not mine
Me too
Yeah
What about me
Well there's an idea
Yeah
That would be great
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th
Look I told you
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand
Well, y'know what
See that's where I think that you're wrong
Hey
Hey babies
What equity investments
I know
And six others
There you are
And that's just in the city
Sure
Well, I'll see you later
Okay, take it easy
Hey
Really
What-what are you doing
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up
But it's my car
Yeah, but it's my wax
Why not
I live upstate
Yeah, so did I
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same
He can do more than that
They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective
Oh it's so cute
How are you still single
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun
How did that happen
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out
Uh yes, heroin and crack
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug
Well, you would know
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage
Oh, come on
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies
Ugh
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think
Would you like to spend the night in jail
No
Of course
That is true
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room
What
I'm pretty sure it's gun
Okay, listen this really hurts
My fault
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing
Hi
I know, the babies are asleep
But my apartment
Y'know, I-I - you've done a lot of stupid stuff too
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one
Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding
Hey
Yeah
What
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea
Excuse me
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life
First of the month
And that's every month
No, just the months you actually want to live here
Ahhh
Uh, yeah
Well, how much do you think he needs
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know
Well that would help the pride thing
It's not your birthday
What a mean thing to say
Hey
Hey
Hey
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing
Well and clearly not a minute sooner
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that
What
No, no don't get mad because look - this is what happened
You're plans were with us
That's right
Yes, but for the last time
Why not
He's at a dinner party
Is he really coming
Of course he is
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese
Oh that's okay
What, are you crazy
Yes it would
Okay, you're on
Okay, let's play
No
Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though
Come on, there's gotta be something
Nope, she's perfect

All right
Ho-ho, you win
Really
You're kidding right
No
Well, one of you has to take the first step
Well, maybe you're right - She made fun of my phone pen
I know, I took it hard too
Hey, y'know what
Because it's my apartment
Well it's mine too
Great
Yeah, I'm just mad
Well, what did you have
Yeah
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it
Really
You're just so mean to each other
She lets you borrow them
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror
Yeah, I do
That's nice
What's wrong
The same way you lost
Oh man
And he never played before either
It's him, not it
When did I try to give you money
I will be okay
Okay
I'm really gonna miss you
Yeah
Bye house

That's not specific to girls
This is great, this is great, what else, what else
Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you
Well, I-I should've told you the truth
Uh-Huh, Which is
Well, it's embarrassing
Why do you care
Because they're people
But people that you don't know and will never see again

That true, I am flaky
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky

It's my joke
Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this
Yeah
Hey Mon

Because you're the only one that can be fair
Yeah
I can't be fair
Yeah, but I'm your brother

Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls
Hey, what are you doing here
I'm so sorry you're sick

I'm fine-d
Oh my God, Jill
And y'know what I said to him
Wow
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer
Okay, I bought a boat
You bought a boat
Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend
Oh, that's so great
Ooh, I like cards
For all the free food you gave away
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it
We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest
No
I would love that job
You went shopping
Sorry Jill
Sorry-sorry Jill
What'd you get
And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants
Apartment pants

Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant
No
Yeah but, he's not your type
Yeah but maybe that's a good thing
She-she died Jill
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room
What
You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today
But it really
Did you tell your sister to ask me out
Well yeah
Oh wow
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not
Oh so-so not really never
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am
Come on
No-no-no-no-no
Fine, I'll rub it on myself
Okay
It's nice
Are you kidding me
Oh come on you big faker
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people
Well that was before all the vaporizing action
Okay, if you really wanna have sex

You asked him too
Hm-mmm
Why
You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him
Hey
I'm not telling you what to do
Why are you so jealous of me
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you
Who
You're jealous of Princess Caroline
Guys, what's going on
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn
Yes, but you are dead inside
All right well, I'd better take that back
Wh-what, why
We can't watch that
Absolutely not
No

Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around
Her ankle is what you're watching
Why are you reading this

Stop it

Oh right great
All right

Ah
You're his bitch
Yeah
How long has it been since you had sex
Well, last weekend
Oh that's not so bad

Maybe you need to spice things up a little
What-what do you mean
I don't know
Y'know, dirty talk, ménage à trois, toys
Wow
Roll playing
Okay, you watch too much TV

Nine

It's harder for me
Well, if it helps there were only three

Noo
No
God I'm just a horrible person
Wh-why
Because I'm married
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person
No
Yes
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother
Look, do you want the ring or not
Yeah
Hey
Look at you
All right
I thought I'd try to take a walk
Whoa-whoa-whoa

You're gonna mess it up let me do it
I'm not gonna mess it up
If she says no, can I have the ring
She's not gonna say no
If
What's the big deal
I think so
I can do that for the kids
Hey, y'know what
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me
Okay
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids
Wait a minute, all jokes aside
Do you really see this as a long-term thing
I don't know
Y'know, you are 12 years older than her

Yeah - Oh that's right
Hi
I didn't know it was an auction
Wh
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat
Why would a charity give away a free boat
I don't know
Ugh
How is you drinking helping the kids
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink
Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth
Okay
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway
What
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth
If the school finds out you're fired
Hmm
She's leaving for three months
For camp

Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor
Glove salesman

That's right, I can throw her off
Yeah
You suck
What

Hi
I don't know why I'm here
I didn't ask
I don't know
No that's, that's okay
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago
Oh really
Ahh
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do
I was not
Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married
Pick me
No
All right
Good
Yeah
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore

Oh my God, I can't believe this
Oh, hey look nothing happened
Nothing happened
Well all right, one thing happened
Y'know what

Yeah, I'm putting my foot down
You thought about that
Yeah
How many kids were we gonna have
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy
What else did you think about
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know
No, I want everything you just said
You sure
Uh-hmm
I love you so much
Oh good
The vicar
Do you even know what a vicar is
Like a goalie, right
Huh
So, what do you think
About what
Yeah, what
What
Well, you-you've always had glasses
No I didn't
Are you sure
Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair
Feminine
Yes
No
Sweetie, I think the glasses look great
Really
Yeah
What we want honey
No, you don't want this
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe
Uh-huh, yeah
I wanted it for years
Break my heart - Oh, all right
Okay
Great
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh
Why would I do that
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it
Yeah
Your own boat
What
What
No, why
Then free as a bird
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us
Wow
No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win
Yeah
He hates to lose
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand
You're not a lefty
Does anybody know me
Why not
Really
Yeah
Two
All right
Wrong
No
I'd say, come again
Don't just say yes
You do
Well I had a great time
And what did he ask you not to call him
I know
You gave my father a lap dance
Why do they put so much steam in there
'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room
Why
Come on, it's not that big a deal
Not that big a deal
I don't want him to tell this story for years
Oh, but he will
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire
I was trying to help out a squirrel
You were trying to eat it
Thank you
Well hello
Why not
Because
What
Well, lesson learned
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson
Six and a half
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom
Well it hit me anyway
All right, y'know what
You won't boss me around anymore
I won't boss you around
And you'll be nice
And, I'll be nice
Let's give it a shot
Okay
No, just a Friday night
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17
Which one was that
The ones we had right after you almost threw up
Right
Nope
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one
I don't know why you just don't say left
What do you mean you quit
Why not
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it
Greens
No
Well, hey I did learn
Really

They have that on the napkins at the club
Oh, I gotta get back to work
You don't have to be back for a half-hour
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch
Oh no, I know that
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else
Why
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club
Dude that is so sad

Could I play
I just did them
Oh, well drop and give me ten more

Both of you together
Wh-what's up

Yeah, and y'know what
Ooh, let's see it
Ahhh

Okay
Wow
Y'know, we don't have to imagine

We'll just see
Me too
Hypothetically
Still
Yeah, I'll do that
Because then I don't have to
Fine
Yep
What'd you rent
Die Hard 2
And it'll be cool to see it again
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans
Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor
Really
Uh-hmm
Ohh
Why does it matter so much to you
Because this one is now
Oh I know
Well, I don't know
We fell asleep
Yeah
I think that would be best
Yeah
Okay
That's sweet
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend
Did you break up with her
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow
Fat
I did not say fat
You broke up with a girl because she was fat
Yeah
Well, apparently she does
All right that's it
Na-uh, I am
How come you are
Because I cared enough to lie
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it
No
Yes we do
I
Come on
I've had better
Okay
All right
Uh-huh

We can't do it again
Why not
Because it's weird
Fine
Sure, what do you got
You're Lewis Posin

Go
Aw, thanks
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology
What
No reason, I'm just saying that uh
I would really love it if could do both
All right, I
What
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again
What
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath
A hundred and forty-five pounds
In one year
Okay
How
You were not supposed to hear that
What if I have babies, okay
I'd carry you around in my pocket
Hi
Yeah
Because I think it means more to you
It really was
Hi
Pretty good
What-what
Yeah - Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl
Y'know what
Hey, I'm gonna call her later
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything
Hi
Hi
Okay, okay take a guess
You didn't bring me here to do that, did you
So, who's the lucky guy
Well, she saw the ring
Did she freak out
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark
You said no right
Lie
Y'know what
Really
No
So-so you would've just lied
Yes
Would it really have been that easy
Yes
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time
Why wouldn't ya
Ohh, listen
I know
Okay
Oh and I'll call ya too
Or I'll call you
And call me
Bye-bye

We want you to marry her

She is so amazing
No idea
Cupid
Man, do you know what guys want
My beers
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere
Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so
Whatever
I'm sorry
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall
Well now what's the rush
Hey
Hey
What's wrong
Who's birthday party
Hey
How did it go with Erin
Oh, unbelievable
Yay
No
Didn't you sleep together
He might still show up
Oh, what are you, stupid
Is that all
I should just go on to happier things, okay
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding
It's actually going to be just family
Oh
What about Benitez
What about Game 1 of the Series
What about shut up
Okay
Kinda
Then change it back
I'm sorry I
No spark
Yeah
Ugh, tramp

Yeah
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak
Okay
Bye guys
Yeah, see ya
Yeah, we were
I find Marion's views far to progressionist
I'm sorry, who are you
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought
Hey
Hi
So how was, how was your date
Oh, it was great
No-no-no-no-no
Well, she told me
Oh
Do you want some pancakes
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever
Kinda like your Barca lounger
Is that what you're thinking about right now
I never stop thinking about it
Honestly
Why
Say again
That's right
Feelings, such strong feelings
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year
No, we're playing this game I learned at work
What
Fifty-six
Oh, right
All right, I'm out of oven space
This-this is crazy
Okay, but if you can't
You're on
Seriously, it's moving
What the hell is in there
I don't know
Which smells delicious
Uh-oh
What
Oh, I'm sorry
Yeah, so she went back to Ohio
Ohio
What dog
Yeah that dog left
Okay, it's um
Are you crazy
Are you out of your mind
Why
It's too cold
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable
1250
Damn, I forgot you were here
Yeah
Really
When it's your assistant, I would say never
Huh
You're right, I'm sorry
Fine
Hey
How are you holding up
Not bad
Yeah
Thanks
So were you guys together a long time
A year
Now that she broke up with you
Yeah
Yeah
It's weird
No
Why
Because, uh - it has to
You have all the answers, don't you
Yeah, I know, I do
Hey, thanks for talking to me
Uh, yeah, well, see, he
Yeah, okay
Hey
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you
Yeah, I knew
Why not
No
Why not
Because you sent away the dog
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that
Okay, but you cannot tell him
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me
What
That's right, she came back all by herself
It's a Thanksgiving miracle
It's up to you
I'm okay
Oh
Thanks for having me over, you guys
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said
Um, I'm not
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out
No, you didn't
Uh-huh
Oh yeah, I remember mine
I never had a bike of my own
Did the girl ever let you ride it
Hey
Making holiday candy for the neighbors
I'm sorry, who
I do
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved
Well, why shouldn't I be
Where you can make out with your assistant
Come on, it's not a big deal
Okay
00
Okay, you hard worker
My what
No, I've just always wanted to do that
Did you eat all the neighbor candy
I love it
Yeah
Ohh
Ahh
Not that way
Hi
It's candy time
Um-hmm
I'm thinkin' no
What did you say
Well, it gets worse
Almost cried huh
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike
Hey
Ohh, uh-huh so much
Of course
Umm, can we see you ride it
Absolutely
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back
Ugh
I told 'em your candy is absolutely indescribable
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever
Please, can't you help me out
Hmm
Stop making candy
But they like it
You mean they like you
Maybe
Is that why you became a chef
Why
Well
What kind of an emergency
You won't let go
No
Swear
I swear
All right
Well
Okay
Doing great
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they
Need some help
No
I know
Let's roll
No, don't worry about it
No, you could've lost your job
Are you kidding me
What
What are you doing
Waiting for candy
No
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while
Skull
Oh, yeah, it's my mom's
Are you gonna dress up as Santa
Nope
How long have we been home
About a half an hour
Lovely
No
Why not
Hey
Hey
Yeah, why not
Really
No
You're sure
Well, no
00
I'm sorry
No, to get a table
You've got to be smooth about it
No
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up
Christmas eve
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah
No Santa
No
How do you know so much about this
I don't know
Yes, thank you
And that makes you angry because
We did have fun, didn't we
We did
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight
Oh, I would love to
Yay, okay
Hello, Sir
No, these are my pants
Oh
Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left
Two days before Christmas
Texas
You're welcome, Ben
Are you for Hanukkah, too
Yeah
Come on Ben
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben
What
Did you bring me any presents, Santa
Why
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it
Yes, is that okay
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa
No
No
Fine, I-I give up
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah
Okay, Santa
Oh, this is terrible
Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up
A little bit, yeah
Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun
Oh me too
Awesome
Yeah
Oh
Oh
Cage closed
Why, why not
Because it's too delicious
Ah-ah-ah Mr
00
Wow, did not know that
Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night
You were invited
No
My God, I can't believe this
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake
Umm, I think he's still out
Oh-Wha-Ho
So what
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex
Well, it does
Another cheesecake came
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem
I can't seem to say goodbye
Are you serious
Hey
What
Why not
Because
What
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad
No that could kill her
Well, we don't want that
No so we're protecting her
But we should take it
But we should move quick
Why
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there
Well
Yeah
Yeah
Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make
Uh-huh
Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here
Really
Really
I mean, there's a statue in Minsk
Uh-huh
Umm, anyway
Uh no, I have to go in a few hours
No he won't
God, you are so strong
00
What
Oh, I used to work with Frannie
Used to work with her
Okay, you're fine
Hey
Are you guys ready
Yes
Okay
It's uh, it's already been roasted
Ohh, then no
You were right before
What
Is to have a long, long talk
Whoa-whoa, what is it
Well
A date
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special
She was
Well, she graduated from high school
Yeah
Fine
Hey
Oh, I wouldn't miss this
Oh yes
Wait a minute
Oh yes
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't
You think I trust you with it
Well that's not fair, you've already had some
What
Are you sure
That's good
Yeah, I
You're right
I-I do though
Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport
Anything I can do
Stick to your side
Hey, come on now
Well
Give us a kiss
No
What
Oh I don't-I don't know
Come here, check this out
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question
All right well, y'know
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway
Hey, y'know what we can do
Okay that does sound like fun
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh
The second sister dies
Sure
No
Yeah
Okay
What
Well all right so, it looks like we're even
I don't know Tag
Fine
Yeah
Do you know what just happened
Yeah
No
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it
Okay
Okay
Give me the good stuff
Oh my God
I did not
Yes it is
How do you know
Yeah
Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now
All right
Okay
I would say that
Face to face, yeah
Okay, here I go
All right
Hi
It's not that far
Do not rush me
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes
Really
Do you wanna
Okay
Hey
What are you doing
Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here
No
No
No
I'm sorry, Rosita
As in Rosita does not move
What
I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house
I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us
Oh please
As much as they love you
I was their first born
Hey
Ugh, I hate this year
What's wrong with this year
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash
Oh yeah, like you never called
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs
We don't need any toner
Oh well, all right
So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions
I'm here
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again
It's a clown kit
Y'know how the garage floods every Spring
How are you ever going to sell this place
So it's just your mother then
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner
Not me
May I ask why
You wanna know why
I surely do
Okay, I don't need any toner because I'm going to kill myself
No-no wait-wait
No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist
No I won't
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like
Francette
No it's not weird, it's a miracle
Miracle
No, y'know what
Someone like an
Dad that won't matter to her
Well, can you blame her
Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it
Really
Well, not right now
Your make-up kit
Fine
Yeah
Yeah
No
All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay
Oh no
No, whatever
Hey guy
Yeah, he's gotta go
Hey
What
Dad
Just mine
I'm afraid so
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs
So, there was no miracle
What are you guys
Why
Because it was fate that made me call you today
I thought it was toner
No
Really
Yes
How
I'm not gonna give you tips
Couldn't it just be a coincidence
No, it's fate
It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate
Oh
I'm actually the office manager
Oh my God
Yeah-yeah
But if - no look, okay
Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right
Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute
Well, what about me
Ahhhh
Hey
Happy birthday
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29
Oh really
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star
There you go
Really
Least of all you
Why
Noo
Yes
Noo
Yes
Really
Yeah, I'll take care of it
Okay
Okay
Yeah
Yeah, we're not thirty, we're 31
Nu-uh
Yea-huh
You have your birth certificate
Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died
Our mom
I just lost a whole year of my life
Well, I never knew mine
Yes
Right, okay, then no
It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun
Okay
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys
Speech
Come on
Will it
What
He's gonna eat the cake
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag
Oh
Whatever

Five to be lying, six
Six months

Good luck
Thanks
Thank God you're here
That's less embarrassing, yes
What a great idea
I know
I thought you said those jokes were funny
What about my questions
I am not gonna show you this
No
Okay fine
I wanna see it
What
Clearly you don't want people to see this tape
You're gonna get pregnant
And in about five seconds you're gonna see why
Now I'm so happy
What are you talking about
You used the Europe story
That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex
How do you know about that story
How do you know about that story
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story

Because I put my head between her legs
To see her pants
They're my pants
Are you sure
No
God
And yet you don't recognize that you're crazy
Here's the plan
I would do it but she thinks I'm attracted to her
Why
Did you not hear where my head was
You see that
It's not looking good
Well, her memory is pretty much gone
Why
Uh, the sex

No problem
My husband
You hired your husband a hooker
She's a stripper
No, she's a hooker
Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes
Either that or she's just the best, most expensive date I ever had
Why would she do that
Maybe she wants you to learn something
What's taking you boys so long
In a minute
Why me
Hey
Which is why you should do it
I don't want to
You do it
You do it

No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day
Oh come on

Me too
Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before
Huh
All right, now don't judge me
Now you can't tell anyone, but uh

Ten centimeters, you're about to become a mom

As we all are at some point during the day
It wasn't my ring
I guess
And you did it first
I know

Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything
Oh, I like that
Honey, we've been over this

Yes
But you didn't give it to her
No
But you were going to propose
No
Huh, I might be losing interest in this
Look

Of course
What
Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant
Whoa-whoa-whoa

I am sorry I am late
Really
And they love me
Oh my God
Yes, she gives the people what they want
All right, watch
I gotta stop this
Oh, who cares, they still love me
You, touching yourself, out
Are you kidding
Hey, do you want to go away this weekend
Oh, that’s what this is all about
Well, call me
Ok
No, wait, you don’t have my phone number
You know, if it’s meant to be, I’ll guess it
Score
Oh, really
Yeah
Oh, really
Oh yeah
What about the guy from the bar
What
The guy you gave your number to
Whoa, how do you know about that
Because he called here looking for you
What
From the guy in the bar, why didn’t I get that message
Why
I don’t know
Oh God
Who am I
Yes
Uh, clearly
Yeah, maybe not
Hi
Thank you
Your eyebrows look weird
Hey
She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did    last night
Bye
Yeah
Yeah
Wow
I'm, I'm okay
Really
No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce
Yeah, sure, why not
Sure, I know lots of girls
Yeah
Ooh, names
Hey
What you got
I don't know
You know what's crazy
I know, I know
You know what
So, what are we gonna do
Hey
You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you
See, now, why would you assume that
Wow
Why
Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know
So I'll bring her by around seven
Oh, it's perfect
Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun
Hey
Well, it's this guy I used to massage
A teacher
Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies
Yeah
She even reads for pleasure
How do you even know a woman like that
What
So now what do we do
Ooh, so this is great
No, I think we killed it
Yeah
Today is the sixth
No, it's not
Okay
I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times
Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me
Can I get you another glass of wine
Nah, I don't know if I should
Got stood up, huh
Yeah, it's no big deal
Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left
No
Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not
So, let's do this
I - I don't think I can
Come on
Sorry
Unless
Well, she's aware when we leave the room
Canoodling
Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front    of the B-A-B-Y
I don't know
I guess you're right
You guess I'm right
I'm kind of funny looking
What
Oh, come on, you're way out of my league
Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter
I lost it
Really
You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends
I don't care
Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned
He's not stoned
Did he go out for a cigarette
Yeah, four times
Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can
Yes, but we have to be fast
Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be
Look; you got stood up, who cares
Ooh
Just get out of here, okay
What's - what's going on
20, I am
This is unbelievable
I think we may have really done it this time
Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test
You may wanna get some more of those too
No
Oh my god, then
Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo
No, we weren't
No, please don't
Hey, I gotta
Unless what
Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family    name
Your family name is Tribbiani
Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but
Really, really not
Eh, it's just as well
All right, well that's good to know
I just had a rough night
Oh
Eww
Well, what happened
Oh, well, I
I did, too
Oh
But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up
Oh, oh no
Why does everyone keep saying that
How - how do I get them to name the next one after me
It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex
Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again
Where
Mexico
I know
I know, I'm so bummed
What
I know
Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love
You know what
No
Because we don't do that
Wow
That's right
I put that tube top on as a joke
I want you to stay
No, no
Wow, Mike Hannigan
So we're doing it
I've always wanted to live with a guy
Listen
Come on
Two thousand dollars
Two thousand dollars
Yeah
Hey
Oo
Oh er
Yeah, Why
Oh, women can
Wha
The hardware store is right down the street
There is a hardware store right down the street
I know it's so exciting
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
Okay, well you put down the toilet seat
Yes dear
Is that a bit you guys do
Uh huh
We don't do that
Yes dear
I can't believe you guys are moving in together
Yeah
Listen er
What
Err
Oh
I can't believe her
Oh no no no no no
What
Something personal
Boob job
I don't want her to get a boob job
Well it's
Oh no
Yeah well, that's the thing
What do you mean
Look
Oh
Was it really that bad
Look it's not about who I would marry
But it's just
Oh
I'm sorry
No
Yeah I get that
So you gave in and decided to call someone
Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding
Thank you
Oh no
Ok, you're being wierd
No no
Ok
Well yes yes
I don't know
Oh my god
You heard him
Hey
Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage
Why
Mike doesn't ever wanna get married
Never
Never
wow, are you still going to move in with him
Yeah, marriage
That's not how you really feel is it
No, I'm sorry
Seriously
It's ok that's how you feel
But come on
I do love Mike
Yeah see
Yeah I guess you're right
Yeah I just hurt it
Yeah
About that
But honey you don't have to
I'm going to get bigger
Honey I
Argh
your ass
Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too
They
It's kind of a package deal
God why why would you want to do that to yourself
I thought I was something that we both wanted
Very cool
Good, good
Uh huh
Well
You know sometimes your words
Hey uh, where do you guys want this
No but
Right
Someday
Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it
I want to live with you too
But I don't think I can
Are you gonna change yours
No
Me neither
But I don't want this to end
I don't want it to end either
I can't believe this is gonna end
Yeah
Oh yeah, let me just finish this
Have you seen this
Uh uh
No
Breaking up sucks
Oh, I'm so sorry
Well no, when I get to the point where
That was a test and you just failed
Damn it
Oh oh oh
Oh, you'll see my friend
Well, how you died was funny
You wanna talk about people's feelings
Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing
I gotta call him
And now your cell
Yes
This is your current cellphone
You can't have it
Give it to me
No, no, it's not a girl, it's
Oh you know what
But he's the same
Yeah, I think she wants the old one back
But he's the same
Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping
Oh no no no no
So how's the piano playing going
Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately
I've missed you too
What are you talking about
Original
No, sorry haven't seen him
Yeah
Are you gonna
How do you think I got him in the first place
Didn't you hear that speech
Who is this
Excuse me
What's with the kissing
Hey, at least I knew where my guy was
You're
Oh we blew it
And I blame you too
Thanks
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time
It isn't ridiculous, look around
Yes, you're right
Wow
And you are
You are married though
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him
Alright
Uh
Hey will you get me tickets too
Yeah me too
No thanks
You don't wanna win the lottery
Pie eating contest
Oh
I did
She dropped off a casserole
Oh yeah
Yeah I know
Well, there's two spots left right
Yeah
Oh can I
Well, it doesn't really matter
I can't tell you what I'm wishing for
Right
Can't really say
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you
One, two, three
Uh, you're not gonna win
Why
Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win
Seriously, that's your fantasy
I don't really care about the Knicks
Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward
You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks
You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word
Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "Daddy" too
Well no, Charlie's gonna get that
Hey, don't say that
He's the boss's son
I'm sorry, idea time is over
Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl
Yeah
What about the ones you have on the nightstand
There are no tickets on the nightstand
Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago
Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago
3 minutes ago
All right, believe me
Fine
Don't come any closer
Friends
Weird
"Listen, oh
Oh God, I am so sorry honey
Oh, so sorry man
Oh, it is so unfair
No, she was just much better at job than me
Guys, the drawing is about to start
Oh, we have one too
We are on a roll, people
Check your numbers
And what did she say
Why-why aren't you more excited
Okay, what does it mean
I don't know all the words
Ok
I'm still looking through mine
Does that mean I get the good loving tonight
And I like to think I had a little something to do with it
Really
You know what
Me too
Seven
We won
What
We won
Let me see
You know what
Me too
Me too
Me too
Hey
Hi
I'd love to
Well you can't
Oh, honey
Are you really that busy
Yeah, I'm sorry
I don't have travel insurance
Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge
Also so gay
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"
Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff
Oh, wish me luck
Ok, not that you need it but good
You don't love him
What do you know about love
I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge
That kiss never happened
Oh, what about this one
Fine
Yes, you do
Don't say that
Thank you
It was
Yeah
You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but
But what
This is kind of a classy place
New York
I am sorry Mr
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please
Not there
Let me get this straight
Totally insane
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there
C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time
Hey
Ow, I'm just going over the script now
Me
But what choice did I have
It's over
How can I
Kiss me
but, but
And I also got
Dude, none of this is cool
At least tell me where you hid it
Yeah
Oh yeah
What do you think brought than on
I don't know
I don't know
It was hard
Ok, we're still on that
I didn't say your songs were not good enough
Then what's wrong with them
Oh really, you want to talk about quality
Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps
There's something new in the bowl
Look, we have enough, just walk away
No, but I want
It's not the same
Ok, go quick
Why
Yeah
Hey
What
Oh
What
So
Ooh
Uh
Ok
I could fall asleep at a play
What is it
a bitter woman's journey through life"
It sounds interesting
What
Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and
No, I don't think it ever works
No reason
Who do you wanna fool around with
Who
Ok, off the top of my head
I know them from work
Both of them
No, one of them
Which one
I don't know, what were the names I just said
Hey
Hey
Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today
It's a
I don't think so
You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok
And you weren't going to tell us
I do it every year
You do that every year
I didn't have to tell you that
And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant
Yeah
OH
Ok, ok
Interestingly
I've lost the will to live
Let's ditch him
What
Come on, he's still in the bathroom
Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department
I don't know
Ok, who is this
What
Ok, what is this
And that horrible museum tour
No, I arranged that
The game's over
Call me
Ok
Eh, you think
A guy who won two
Oh my God
She
Hey
Oh, Very funny
Well you should be
No
Did somebody sign your bra
So I got it when I was 13
It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize
Go Charlie
And sexy
Ok well give her a chance to see all of that
I could, I could but I don't want to
No
my first period
Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok
Why do you care so much
Yeah, it's no big deal
Hi
I'm gonna get some more coffee
Oh, you know what
You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself
Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious
Well, I would like to have the option
No, you can't go there
And she wants to go hunting, too
Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok
Well, do you care about friendship
Oh
Promise
I promise
Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year
But I don't wanna do it in a cup
What is the big deal
It's weird
Come on in, how are ya
I'm good
Can I offer you a drink
Yeah, definitely, definitely
And first, I have to see the MET
Ok, let me stop you right there
The museum
Ok well, I'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready
Ok
Have a seat through the glass doors
Alright-y then
But that woman can't know I work here
'Cause it's good money
I need to talk to you about Charlie
Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious" means, just don't use it
No, look, you know Charlie, right
Get to the problem
Yes
You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship
Ok
Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET
Ok
You got to tell me exactly what to do there
I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares
OH MY GOD
Oh, Come on
So, what's your name
It's a normal Swedish name
Ok
Ok, but you know what
No idea
Yeah
That's not the hard part honey
I don't know
For like a half an hour
How could you not tell me you worked here
I don't have to tell you everything
You know what
Hey, how was the Met
The museum was amazing
Yeah
Well
Hey
What
I'm sorry too
Oh
Maybe you could take Charlie shopping
Oh, well
I'm sure you have better things to do
Are you kidding
Ok, uh-uh
Exactly
Oh, ain't that nice
Hi
Oh, DAMN IT
Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference
So you're up for keynote speaker
Professor Sherman, yeah
But you come first
I'm there
Well
So, I don't have to learn what that means
See, I told you I needed someone
Yeah
You've seen all the movies
Yeah
Ok
Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else
You know that depends on what it is
She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her
Why
Who else
Anybody
Uh, wow
Yeah
So can we keep this between us
Sure
Hey
Thanks
Uh
Well, maybe she didn't hear
Ooh
Oh
Oh my God
And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone
No
I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker
Oh
It could be better
What
Barbados
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive
I can't
I think he is fine
Alright
Oh
Sure
Good plan
No
Yeah
You know, by the way
Then don't go
Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike
Yeah
Well, I'm back from Minsk
Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done
Well, it's great that you're back
Good, good, life is good
Good
Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone
You're kidding me
Really
Yeah, I know
I'd love to
Great
No, that's David
There's a third guy
You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer
No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired
Ok
Does seem pretty perfect
Yeah, you think so, well
Yeah, he's better
No, he's not
Really
Yeah, I'm sure
Adoption
How do you feel about that
I think I feel ok about it
Me too
So this is it, we're really gonna adopt
No you didn't
Really
No you did
All right, let's do it
I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech
Wow
Sarah
Yeah, oh and Sarah
Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives"
You don't own a TV
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip
Oh, I should go, too
Mike is your ex
That's right
It's ok
Really, it doesn't mean anything
I'm sooo sorry
I guess, in time
Yeah
I'm sorry, uh
What
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point
I didn't mean now
Hey
Yeah
Wha
Oh I can't
But maybe we can have dinner later
Oh
Yeah, yeah
I did
Hey
Everything is upside down here
That would be advice
Wow
What are you serious
I love Mike
What, oh my God
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it
Why, why would you open it
Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"
What did it say
NO
Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now
Yep
Yeah, well you should
Well, what do you do
Well, I usually go
Wha
No, I called him
Well, I've brought some books
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet
Yeah
That's Ben, my son from my first marriage
Your first marriage
Yeah
You're married more than once
"Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay"
I know
Well, let's see
Tell me who it is
Yeah
Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who
Later
So, shall we
Bye
Good night
Night
You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now
But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart
It's David, actually
No, Mike's here
I have a question I need to ask you
I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself
Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this
Sorry David, but she really has to know this
Alright, but after this I want to see you outside
I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy
I love you
David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry
Just so I know, if I had asked first
Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong
Hey
Damn it
He said "erectus"
You're
No, he really said it
Homo
Yeah, and so funny
Oh
Yeah
You blew them away
They have a game room downstairs
Oh, yeah
Yeah
All right, all right
But then how do we know who wins
Nobody wins
So, we're just four losers
I'm not playing with you
Yeah, I'm out
I'll play ya
Oh, by the way
Hell, yeah
Wanna make it more interesting
How much were you thinking
Ten bucks a game
Make it fifty
I'll make it a hundred
Tails
Oh, no
Nooooo, why
Oh well, she said we have nothing in common
yeah, it's true
I mean, she should be with someone like
W-What are you, what are you talking about
Ok
Yeah, sure
Only like a month
Yeah, he had a paper route
But can it
It's not a big deal
NO BIG DEAL
It's so not a big deal
Yeah
Ok
Do you
Ah, yeah
Do you
Best out of three
That's what I'm thinking
I knew that was him
Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best
Or we could throw you both in now
But
Look
What about the obsessive cleaning
That's just good sense
What
Because I'm gonna play for ya
You can't do that
Oh, that's ok
Ok
It's like watching porn
Why
I don't know
This is so great
Hi
Are they still looking for us
I don't think they did
All right, all right
I'll put a pillowcase over my head
You're on
What's up
Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the   way there's  no law against
He could be alone
Oh my God, that's Charlie
I'm not sure about this
Yeah, you're right
No I'm not sure that it's  the best way to hear   everything
Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay
Get over here
Wow
Anything
I think I hear curtains closing
We've got shoes being kicked off over here
Yeah, It's just
Ooh
And she's
You got it
Oh
Hi
Shhh
You would think
YE-AH
Now, what is this
Ah, what is this
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything   really happens with her
Sure
Probably, yeah
Yeah, I think that'd be best
Six years
Absolutely
No
I'm thinking about you
Yeah
Nothing
Seriously
Nothing
Sorry, I just uhm
COMMERCIAL BREAK
Hey
You guys ready to go
Not quite
You're not supposed to take that
Yeah, sounds like a good idea
PHD
Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright
Who's day just got better
I think
Ye
It's so
You've never said that in your life, have you
Not once
I thought so
Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care   about your social life
Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie
Oh, I uh, I mean, I
I understand
You don't have to go home tonight, do you
No, I think I can come over
Oh
What
Uhm
Why not
I have a date
You have a
Oh, it's
For how long
Three months
Three months
Oh, okay
You know what, we're gonna have sex
I guess so
Still nervous
I'm gonna get the lasagna
Do you mind if I sit here for a sec
Hey
So, I uhm
Yeah
Okay, last night after you guys broke up
You kissed
Yeah, we kissed, but
What
It's okay
Are you serious
Yeah
Oh
No, I mean it
You know what
Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you
I can't think of anything
Yeah
Hi
Oh
Yeah
Oh, so everything's okay
Oh, no, it's great
Ah
Well, I'm so excited about this
Really
Are you kidding
Thank you
Hey, it's Mike
Ooh, that was fast
Oh, err
One more thing
Her name is Precious
Yeah
You what
Did I
Again, let's journey back
And the eye
Aaah
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Well, yeah
Oh, not another one
Wow
I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's   going on here
Alright
My name is Precious
Yeah, I can't say that
Well, I don't
Oh, why would he do this
Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you
I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now
Damn it woman, pull yourself together
Not really
Really
Hi
So, did you err
Alright, alright, okay, uhm
Okay, that sounds fair
I know, I know
No
Stop saying good night
Okay
I think you know
Really
This is what I want to do
Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much
We weren't doing anything
No, come on, that is a lie
So you two are
Yeah
And have you
No, no, no
No, no, no
But if I hadn't walked in here, would you
Probably
I'm not going nuts
No, but you know what I mean
Calm ourselves
No
Look, don't you think that will be a little weird
Hey
Hey, have you seen Frank Jr
You know, it's funny
Hey, what's all this stuff
That's not really how it works
Oh, how does it work
I don't know
Thanks, that would be great
Hey
Hey
Good to see you
Good to see you, too
Hi Frank
Hi, how you doin'
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big
Oh, that's Frank Jr
I'd take you out for a romantic night
Hey
Hi, hi
Oh, you bet
Oh
And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you   want
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out
You know what
That's a, that's a long time
Sometimes I think that
What
No, I can't
Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving
Oh, no
What
Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us
Well, actually, I think this might help
Oh my god
It's
The bathroom is down the hall, to your left
Can I adopt you
Yeah
You were
You wanna see it
I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your   parents
What
What
I'm adopted
Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it
Dude, are you okay
Oh, you know what
No, of course we're not
Insane
I know
Alice would never go for it, right
Huh
Frank Jr
Oh, you'd be getting a really good one
Uh-huh
Oh, no, no
Wow, Frank
Oh, I think you're right
I'm sorry, Frank
How about tomorrow
Well, that's not good
You'd do that for us
Are you kidding
We have to leave
Why
I didn't get to the bathroom
Oh my god, where's my purse
Some little snacks for everybody
I'll go get him in a second
But kids are so intuitive
See
What
He told me
Which technically now you should give back
You told him he's adopted
I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or   something
He isn't
Oh my god, are we supposed to answer
O is for "oh, wow
Totally
No
Okay
Alright
Bye
Oh, oh
No, no, it's just that it's getting late
Hey, hey, it's fine
Yeah, that's probably a good idea
Yeah
Uh-huh
Thanks
Yeah
So you took off my pants and shoes
No, no, no
What do you mean
Hey, what are you talking about
That's what I hear, yeah
This is crazy
And she feels the same way
I think so
Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on
No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me
Yeah, I'm sure
And we're okay
Hey
Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up
Still, he had to find out sometime
Wow
Naa, no
Well, I
Really
No, no no no no
No, I do six things
and beer
I'm sorry, it's just
She went on one of those spray-on tan places
Eh, you got a spray-on tan
I know, Amanda
Who's Amanda
Oh, what are we gonna do
Ugh, Let's just cut her out
What
Cut her out of our lives
You've got to face the red light
Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat
Wow, you catch on quick
You've never turned
Mississippi
So, how dark is it   gonna get
Yeah
Ok, so sorry
Ok
Oh, you’re right
I did
Okay
All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this   thing
Oh
Sorry
Well this is romantic
Well, it wasn't just me, alright
Wow, really
Is Amanda here yet
No
Hi
When were we not friends
Oh My God
Oh
Yes ma'am, ready to Power through
Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it
No, no, no

Love you too
Yeah, me too
Really
No, I just had to get a picture of this
Wait, you can't go away this weekend
We're having a party
Well, can't you just have the party when we get back
No
No, that day
There's this thing I really want us to do
Yeah, we want everyone to be there
Oh, just think
Hey hey
Oh, she's still napping
Are you freaking kidding me, Green
Thank you
Oh man, this is great, uh
I've got a plan
No, no, no
You know, I could like maybe
What did you get her
Actually we prepared performances
Separate performances
But equally real
Well, this sounds like fun
Yes, you’ll be all grown up by then
That’s true
Sure
Oh, you're gonna love this cake
And you know, I have a massage client soon
You guys, just please
Alright, 5 more minutes
No
Well, we better get going, it's late
Anyway, it was lovely seeing you
Nighty-night
Nighty-night
Bye, bye
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh

No
Oh
Right
I'm too excited
Come on robot
I bought you
Good job Alan
I can't believe this
It's not bad
Well, I'm very impressed
Some can sing, some can dance
That's how old you are
Did I teach her that
I wasn't
Oh good, I didn't miss the party
What about your massage client
I just felt so bad, missing this
I don't care that you left
Hey, guys
Oh my God
Oh
Okay, here we go
Oh yeah, nothing
Yeah
A-a-and
I've never given her a cookie
No
Thank you
I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok
Wow
Yes, I do
OH
YEAH
So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate
Uh-uh
So, you know
Hi
Hi
Nice to meet you
That's right, yeah
You're not good
Always nice to meet a fan
So now, what are you doing here
Well, I have huge news
What do I know
What
Oh, I know, isn't she
Oh
What
This guy
A-And
A-And it's on Fifth
Oh
Yeah
It's his dad
Huh
Old
Myron
Oh
I’m gonna marry Myron and keep looking   for Mr Right
I FEEL THE SAME WAY
Oh, it’s the worst way to propose
Yep
I took your advice, I left Myron
Oh, good for you
I know
Thank you
What
Yeah
Good morning
Amy, you know what
I doubt that
Word
Well, mine was worse than that
Well, what happened
Yeah, I really do
Thank you
Absolutely
Ok, ok, so how should I do it
How about at a game, on the big screen
Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child
Why not
Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella
I
Great, I'm finished
Yeah
Can we read it
Hey, what did you guys do today
Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi
That sounds like fun
Yeah, not really
Why not
I'm a cool, fun aunt
Since today
Well, it should be
Well, I think you should wait
Why
Well, if you don't
Excuse me
Yeah
No
Oh my God
I love you more
Hi
My God
Hey
It's, yes, my little black book
I would, but you're the last one
Oh
Oh, then I'll tell you
Cool
Oh
Wow, that's great
Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars
Yeah
No, no, we ended up in great terms
Well, if you think it would help
Yes, absolutely
Ok, now, is there anything I can do to
Mmh
Yeah
Oh, well
Well, of course I do
Really
Absolutely
Damn it, I did not think this through
Oh
He's not right for the part
Well, I
So good to see you
What
What
Did you just say "break up with Charlie"
Well, yes, and now
Kind of inappropriate, don't you think
I'm sorry
If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking
No
Joking it is
Wow, what's the bad news
Who's Gladys
Huh
Well, I mean, sure, of course
No, I couldn't let you do that
But I want to
But I don't want you to
But I insist
But I insist harder
Bad news
I'm not lying to you, I watched it
Wha
You're right, I apologize
But you are a liar
What did I just say
Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt
Hey, you got one right
Crazy, or
Crazy
Alright, fine
She's yours
SHE'S YOURS
She's yours
She's mine
She's mine
She's mine
She's mine
She's mine
I know
Now, what do you say
Lying is wrong
And
I'm a pretty little girl
I knew it
Did you get the grant
No I didn't, and you want to know why
What
Yeah
Benji isn't in love with me
Oh, I'm sorry, no
I want you to tell her everything
Benji
Alright, it's true
Too little, too late, Benji
I can't believe this
I never should have broken up with you
What
I don't know what to say, Benji
or
Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable
COMMERCIAL BREAK
You're mean
Oh, don't be such a baby
Hey
Hey, what are you doing
Yeah
It's really crazy
So what did you two do about it
But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use
Are you serious
Yeah
Hey
What's going on
Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment
Kind of
What
Yes
Completely anonymous
Mr
Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y
And "X" is spelled uhm
thank you both very much
Sure, I so glad we did this
It does
Oh, that's OK
There was one
So, uhm
Ok
But you already gave all your money to charity
Well, I’ll just ask for it back
I don’t think you can do that
Why not
That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady
Ok
Careful, watch her hair
Ok
It’s for our wedding day
Yeah
I am sorry
Thank you
Would you like something to drink
Oh, water would be fine
Ok
Oh, because we love kids
Your place is just lovely
Ah, thank you
You know, I
Oh
What
I just realized why I remember this place
Really
Oh, it's nothing
Of course it was
So you're not friends with him
No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea
Good
If you hold a spider
What's going on
WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT
Is he alright out there by himself
Oh yeah
Bert and Ernie
Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now
Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble
Well, we're not
We don't have a code word
We don't
I forgot my bat
I can explain
Excuse me
Oh
I gave you my number, you never called me
No, no
I don't know
Yeah, that we totally understand
Boy, you people are nice
No, no, we're here to give the money back
Yeah, because you know what, it's
What
On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money
But
Well, I mean
Oh, is that you
No
That's great
Now we just have to wait for a call and
See
A-alright
There you go
That's because he's on your neck
Hi
Hey
We need to talk to you about something
Yeah
What
Hey

She's putting words in your mouth
Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths
I can't believe this
What
Am I
That's my favourite kind
We are supposed to make these decisions together
Hi
You're not making the pies yourself
No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies
Did you at least win the contest
2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin
Can't wait
This dinner is gonna be so great
Well, I was thinking
You don't know that
Somebody is gonna pick us
Oh

Center ice
Did I do something to you
Hmm, the game's at one

You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before
I can't believe this, she's our daughter
Yeah
Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged
Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged
Well, let's just go in there and face them
Well, I'm not going in first
That's fire
"Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy"
So, so sorry
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad
So bad
So bad

It's wrong
But she liked us
But we are not the one she chose
Technicality
I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay
But you just said "What's mine is yours"
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT
Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal
Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece
Mmmm
Oh yeah, sure
TIME LAPSE
Hey
Hey
The agency must have made some mistake
That's impossible
I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like
So who are you
Ooh
Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy
Yeah, and you know what
I would get a room with this cake

Hey
I was in the car with Nancy all day
Nancy doesn’t smoke
Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that
So
It’s perfect
So
I don’t know
I think we should
I do too
This is huge
I know
How bad you wanna smoke, right now
I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette
We don’t
Okay

So, should we tell her
I don’t know
If only there were a smaller one to clean this one
Hey, is uhm

And about an hour ago, we made an offer
TIME LAPSE
You put an offer on a house
What the hell are you doin'
Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here
Hey, that's

Space cowboy
Correct
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game
It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding
TIME LAPSE
That is not true
Don’t blame the questions
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way
You’re just so mean to each other
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror
Yeah, I do
That’s nice
Sure
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas
And a crappy New Year

And about this Nancy thing
Yeah

We got the house
Oh my God

Oh my God
We're growing up
We sure are
So who's gonna tell them
COMMERCIAL BREAK
You'll see
All right, everybody open them
Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but
Enjoy
Hey, let me tell them
Sure
Really
Except for "Match game"
Or "Win, Lose or Draw"
What did I marry into
Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show
Oh, I can't
Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends
Oh God, that's right
Are you asking permission to break the pact
Yes please
Hey

You know, our band is playing on Friday
Yeah, yeah
No way

Boss

Dude, I was gonna ask her out
I said it first, bro
Me too

Paper, snow, a ghost

Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right
Hey
Oh, wow
Well, I will, because I won't be playing with you
I'd love to
Great
So how come it took you so long to ask me out
That's ok
Yeah, why
You did
Yeah
It's the police
Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,
Are you kidding
Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment
Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off
Are you talking about me
Oh, no
No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book
No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything
Didn't do anything
I don't care
Oh really

I don't know what
Really
Hey, you've got a boyfriend

I KNOW
Do NOT let me sit in one of those
You know, it's fine
No, no, you're right
No, wait
I don't know
So maybe something in an office
Or you could teach stripping
There you go
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Your last dance
Really
Dude, dude
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter
Well, it matters to me
Why
Because
Two guys in one night
Seriously, where did this happen
Oh wait
Mine
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed
No, she was definitely on my bed
Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed
Well, then who was on my bed
I was the pile of coats
OH MY GOD
You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser
What did I marry into
Listen, I need to ask you something
Seriously
Yeah, you've
Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this
Please

How's that
I wanna say it's not looking good
Uhm

And it's a wedding
Hey guys, how is it going
Fine
Who cares, AND
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus
Please, you're going down
Strike two
You're right

I decided to pee
Mike didn't tell you
Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party
What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that
Happy wedding day
Oh, happy my wedding day to you
Oh, well that's ok
Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this
Hi

Get out of my line
Okay
Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan
Wrong again

You seriously changed your name to that
Uh-huh
Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela

I do love it, and I love your name
And I love Crap
Woah, uh
I don't have any great ideas
What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends
My parents say I'm gonna make new friends
Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young
I'm fantastic
Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it
Great
I hate that guy
Oh

Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job
I'm serious

Why not
Thank you, mister Bag
Why don't you tell her my name
Yeah
Really
Yeah
It's a funny word
She's still at dinner
I guess
That guy Mark
So what if he wants to sleep with her
Excuse me
Oh please
For your information, I was staring at her baby
Oh, sorry
Oh, it was great
Should we send something
How did the job stuff go
He offered me one
That's great
Congratulations
I know, it's amazing
He offered me one
So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris
I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out
Thank you
I got a really incredible job offer
Hey, great
Good for you
It's in Paris
Well, it comes and goes
Look, you guys
Well, it makes me feel sad, but
I know, but what are we gonna do
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes
I don't know
But what if it is better than ours
She died
You're kidding
That's terrible
Yeah, she was just an agent
Seriously, you don't think we should tell him
Well, not for a little while
What if he reads it in the paper
Oh right, uhm, Don
Uhm, well
Oh, no
She is good
That’s great
I’m just mad at my agent
Estelle
Ok
I guess I dropped the ball there
Don’t take that tone with me
What are you saying
Hi
Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today
Nooo
So, you’re not going to Paris
No, I’m still going
Thanks
So
Love it
Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice
Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer
But we love our house
Okay, you got it
Yes
This is gonna make me very popular
Can I ask you something
Huh
I never stopped loving you
Oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't say that
Hey
You are never going to believe what happened to me today
What
Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money
They did
Yeah
So, what are you gonna do
Well, I took it
That's great
YAY
You're excited, right
It's what you want
You really think so
I really do
But I already told Zelner that I would come back
Yeah
Yeah
Ok
Just flip
Hey
So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven
Oh, that sounds good
Oh, yeah, right
I know
It should be right next to my plane ticket
Well, it's not
I know
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you
Hi
Right, no, I understand
Oh, ok
Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense
Plus hotels are fun
Erica, those things aren't free
Oh, I know
Oh, no
From
Jumping on the bed
Hey
Oh, he has a gig
Yeah
No, no, no
Come here, I'll make you a drink
Oh, man
Uh-hmm
You guys are gonna come and visit me, right
Yes
I know
Oh yeah, right
That would be a terrible punishment
Really
Ok
Ok
Can you come here with me for a minute
Sure
Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you
I know what you mean
Well, these aren't mine
These are not mine
Let me just say something
Oh, you're definately not
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news
Oh, you guys
No, I don't think so
You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk
Yeah
THE HELL I DO
What
Tell me about it
Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party
All right, I think I'm gonna head out
Uh, where do you think you're going
Yeah
Good
Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them
Hey
Come on here, have a seat
How was your night
Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much
Oh my God
Relax
Oh my God
Yeah, you got to get to the hospital
You can do this
Okay, okay
That's what it seemed like
You keep, you keep
WHAT
Yeah
All right, here it goes
Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much
Oh my God
Relax
Oh my God
Shh
Oh
It really was
Who's laughing now
I know
Next time, can I say breathe
No, I'm okay
Alright, I'll be right back
Where are you going
To use the bathroom
You can't leave me alone with her
What
This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with
What kind of social situation are you comfortable with
It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together
You'll be fine
Okay
I don't know
Hah
Well, it's just interesting
Hey
What's that
Uh-huh
I did not see that coming
Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know
Yeah
That is the rule, though
What
Yeah, Erica went into labor last night
Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl
Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out
What's that smile
Oh my God
So what does that mean
Oh, I
But do you wanna get back together
I don't know
Wow, I hadn't thought of that
Guess we'll never know how it ends
Okay
Hey
Hey
Hey
Good
Good
I bet you did
Uh
Sure, yeah
Chick and the duck
You too
It really was
Help me
Is it really that bad
Uh-huh
Alright
Start pushing
Wow
Is he okay
He's just fine
Oh, you did it
We'll just get him cleaned up a bit
How do you feel
I'm tired
Well, you don't have that much time to relax
The next baby should be along in a minute
We only ordered one
You know it's twins, right
Oh, yeah
COMMERCIAL BREAK
Well, gosh
Twins actually run in my family
What do you mean "what do we do"
Why not
Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt
Okay
Okay
It looks like we're about ready over here
Ow
Oh my God
Nothing
You can't just give up
What
You really think so
Can't a girl finish a song around here
Hey
Hi
Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight
Are you kidding
Could you get me a muffin
I
Unbelievable
Hey, you know what might help
I'm not getting you a muffin
Maybe
Oh my God, that's just like my name
Son of a gun, it is
Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest
Bye
Bye
We'll call you
Okay
Have fun at church-camp
I know
Okay
Okay
Alright, let's see
Yeah, I'm good
It's a
Hey

Because she's just going to shoot me down
Yeah, and she still wants to go
Yeah, I know what you mean
No, you don't
Hey
Oh, I made a little something
Honey, that's gorgeous
You know, the baby can't read, Mike
Yeah, did she sound happy about it
Oh my God
What
Okay, okay, awkward question
Yes, it's twins
Oh my God
Oh, they're so cute
Aw
Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica
Yeah
Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad
Aw, he's gonna be so happy
Oh, Jack Bing
Seriously
One
Really
Yeah
Oh, you guys, I can't believe this
I'm just so glad you got to see the babies
I love you
I love you
Call us when you get there
I will
Neither will I
Yeah
Hey, maybe that's for the best
Yeah
Yeah
But now she'll never know how he feels
Yeah, that's true
What
I don't
Really
Yeah, I'm gonna go after her
Yeah, you are
Woo
My coat
This is so cool
I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited
I don't know, but I
You didn't bring one
Hurry
Good luck, good luck
Okay
18th and East End
Alright, I gotta report you
My medallion number is, "Get out of the cab
What
Now, that you can do
Alright
Are we off the bridge
Yes
Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive
Yes, she jumped right back up
You should have thought of that before you got in
Okay
Okay
Oh, great
Oh, don't worry, we'll find them
Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins
Alright
Oh
It's okay, it's just an egg roll
Oh
You stepped on my egg roll
I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor
Just put it on a plate and leave
Alright
Well, that can't be good
We gotta get them out of there
How
Oh, oh
Oh
I don't know
Okay
No
I don't know
Oh my God
I know
All right, you know what
It did not
You have to get a ticket to get past security
What
Not with that attitude
Oh
Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass
I have it, I have it, I have it
Okay, fine
Just one
We're on our honeymoon
No, did we miss it
No, no, no
Maybe we have the flight-number wrong
Hey, it's me
That's alright
Oh, wait, wait, wait
That is precious
Yes, that's what I have
40, Newark airport
What
Newark airport
What's the matter
I need to say goodbye to the table first
I understand
Okay
Well, I can't do it either
Yeah, they're stuck inside the table
We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it
Oh, well sure
She's got her cell, you could call her
I am not doing this over the phone
You don't have any other choice
Yeah
Uhm, actually no
What
I have this feeling that something's wrong with it
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane
Oh, that was just my crazy friend
I wouldn't worry about it
But she is sometimes
Well
Well, I can't take this plane now
Excuse me, sir, where are you going
I have to get off this plane, okay
Could I get some peanuts
What's wrong with the plane
There's nothing wrong with the plane
Yeah
There is no Philange
Oh my God
I'm not flying on it
Ma'am, please sit down
What's going on
We're all getting off
That was
Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it
Yeah
You gonna buy a new one
Probably not
Well, at least we got these little guys out
Yeah
Aww, we were worried about you
Hey, you know what
What
Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now
I could get a goose
You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry
Thanks man
Yes, the Philange is fixed
I don't see her
No, no, I just have to talk to someone
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass
No, no, no, but
Okay, you're on
What
Okay, the thing is
Yeah
Don't go

Please, please stay with me

So did you guys make it in time
Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway
I got off the plane
You got off the plane
I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again
Okay
Me neither, okay
Okay
This is it
I know
Uh, I haven't
Wait a minute
Oh, honey, I forgot
Oh, okay
Yeah
Okay, should we get some coffee
Sure
