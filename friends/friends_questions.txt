He's just some guy I work with
A hump and a hairpiece
It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex
Had that dream
there
Instead of
That's right
Never had that dream
No
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself
No, just leave my aura alone, okay
Be murky
I hope she'll be very happy
No you don't
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me
And you never knew she was a lesbian
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well
A wrong number
Have some hormones
Hi, sure
Who wasn't invited to the wedding
I say push her down the stairs
You can see where he'd have trouble
It's her wedding day
Buzz him in
Who's Paul
Paul the Wine Guy, Paul
Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy
He finally asked you out
Yes
Hey
Paul, was it
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah
Hey, Paul
It's been kinda a long day
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket
Which goes where
Done with the bookcase
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here
She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get
You guys
Oh, God
You got screwed
Oh my God
I mean, how clean can teeth get
How did you get through it
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel
Ooh, steer clear of you
I'm only 26 and I'm divorced
I don't think that was my point
Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her
Grab a spoon
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny
Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh
What, you wanna spell it out with noodles
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date
Isn't there
It's okay
how long
Two years
I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch
I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life
That is amazing
Congratulations
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do
Morning, Paul
Hello, Paul
Thank you so much
What the hell do you do on a real date
it doesn't make much of a difference
So, like, you guys all have jobs
See, that's how we buy stuff
Yeah, I'm an actor
Would I have seen you in anything
Look, it was a job all right
I can't stop smiling
You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth
Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco
Oh, yeah
With feelings
Are you in trouble
Big time
Hardly used
Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work
Oh, look, wish me luck
How was Florida
You had sex, didn't you
Who
You know Paul
Oh yeah, I know Paul
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul
I hate men
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe
Guess what
You got a job
I was laughed out of twelve interviews today
And who pays for that
I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want
C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life
That's why I was getting married
Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time
Thank you
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'
All right, you ready
"  Come on, I can't do this
You can, I know you can
That was a library card
No, I gotta go home sometime
You be okay
Goodnight, everybody
Sorry-
No no no, go-
No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
Split it
I knew
I did
Maybe
Yeah, maybe
okay, maybe I will
Goodnight
Oh, was I doing it again
Yes
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya
Did you make it, or are you just serving it
I'm just serving it
Y'serious
Oh, yeah
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss
Absolutely
basically just trying to stay awake
Well, she has issues
' See
Hi
So
I hate that
You look good too
Still, uh
A lesbian
how's the family
Oh, and, uh-
Why- why are you here, Carol
I'm pregnant
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down
And not-not in a good way
What
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster
Has anybody seen my engagement ring
No, look, don't touch that
Yeah
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last
Probably right before she lost it
You didn't
That is not a happy hi
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon
basically it's entirely up to me
I miss her
What does she mean by 'involved'
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done
Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow
So what are you gonna do
Curry
Mmmm
They all had a thing for him
Aw, Mom
Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well
but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar
What's that supposed to mean
It's an expression
No it's not
Your folks are really that bad, huh
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins
You're twins
She's like this high-powered, driven career type
What does she do
You don't have any of this
my parents actually preferred
How long was I in there
I'm just cleaning up
a little
Mm-hmm
A lot
Mm
Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped
When did it get so complicated
Got me
Remember when we were in high school together
Oberman
And is he-
She
special situation
Barry
Robbie's gonna be here for hours
Huh
So, how ya doin
You look great
I dumped him
Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made
Marlon-
Marlon
-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl
As in Mouse
As in my grandmother
how about Julia
Julia
We agreed on Minnie
What have you been up to
I-I got a job
Oh, that's great
Why are- why are you so tanned
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba
You went on our honeymoon alone
Now, this may hurt
My maid of honour, Mindy
They haven't quite taken yet
But you hate sticking your finger in your eye
Listen, I really wanted to thank you
Okay
And I'm an orthodontist
Wow
Spit
I don't think so
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch
Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title
It's my baby too
Um, I don't remember you making any sperm
Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is
'Cause I think that borders on child abuse
Oh my God
Look at that
Isn't that amazing
What are we supposed to be seeing here
Then don't do that, alright
Wh- are you welling up
No
You are, you're welling up
Am not
Hi
Oh, oh, how'd it go
He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again
Ouch
He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right
Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'
Since when
And everybody knows this
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die
Hey, that was really good
Let's keep going
Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh
'Cause in my cell, I can smoke
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone
What
Not so much
Whoah
Hey
Hey
Give it to me
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette
You feel complete
That's ridiculous
Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank
What did they do to you
I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
Easy
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account
Oh, Satan's minions at work again
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping
Oh, God
What is this
I'm smoking, I'm smoking
You've been so good, for three years
And this- is my reward
Just think about what you went through the last time you quit
Okay, so this time I won't quit
I- I can't drink this now
I'm gonna go change, I've got a date
How's it goin'
It's nice, and, we're having fun
So when do we get to meet the guy
Never
Come on
Not after what happened with Steve
Sorry
Just give me a chance to figure that out
Well, then can we meet him
I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd
I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi
Do you all promise
Everybody, this is Alan
Hi
Hi, Alan
C'mon
We loved him
He's great
We're talking about someone that I'm going out with
The way his smile was kinda crooked
Like the man in the shoe
What shoe
Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it
You know what I like most about him, though
What
The way he makes me feel about myself
how was the game
Well
Yes
How is that possible
Alan
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball
sometimes
What
I dunno, a little too Alan
You can never be too Alan
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore
Hey, Lizzie
Hey, Weird Girl
I brought you alphabet soup
Saltines
I know
Weird Girl, what are you doing
I don't want it
No, no, I ha-I have to give you something
Oh, that's fine, no
Would you like my tin-foil hat
No, it's okay, thanks
Please, let me do something
Okay
Okay
Eww
Like, collect all five
Does, um, anyone wanna see
Cut it out
It's worse than the thumb
Hey, this is so unfair
Oh, why is it unfair
Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly
I should really get back to work
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like
No
Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like
All right, a cow got through
I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing
it's gonna be really hard
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it
Do you have any respect for your body
If only he were a woman
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart
Hey, I might
Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb
Oh my God
I just think it's nice when we're all here together
That was Lambchop
Please, guys, we have to talk
no, I'm not
Alright, we have to talk
There it is
Is there somebody else
People change
We didn't change
Look, I- I could go on pretending-
Y'know, the way they were
There'll be other Alans
Right
Are you guys gonna be okay
Wow
I'm, I'm really sorry
But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved
Relieved
That was fun
Mmm
So how'd it go
Oh, y'know
I'm getting cigarettes
And bigger boobs
Probably kill myself
How does she do that
I cannot sleep in a public place
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again
What's going on with you
I got no sleep last night
Why
Less than a hundred steps from our place to here
Funny, my birthday was seven months ago
"The glass is half empty
Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember
Ohhh
What's wrong with the twentieth
Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger
Hi, me
Wow, you worked in a mine
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job
You can totally, totally live on this
Yeah, yeah
Oh, by the way, great service tonight
What
Peach pit
-Peaches
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar
Let's talk reality for a second
Okay
When are you coming home
Guys, I'm not
C'mon, this is us
I've got this job-
Waitressing
What's that
But I haven't used my card in weeks
Look, they just wanna see if you're okay
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans
It was the first frost
And for what
You are just like Jack
Jack from downstairs
No, Jack and the Beanstalk
Ah, the other Jack
Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow
It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like
Floopy
Yeah
un-floopy
I don't like this question
Pass it
He's open
Well, you'll have to wait your turn
What
Do you have a plan
I don't even have a 'pl'
Oh, bonehead, bonehead
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks
Yeah, that sounds about right
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit
And-and a power tie
Who's George Snuffalopagus
Big Bird's friend
Who are we spying on
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt
Oh, I love him
wait, I see a woman
Please tell me it's his mother
Definitely not his mother
Light still out
Yeah
Maybe they're- napping
Oh please, they're having sex
Shut up
So, whaddya think George is like
I think he's shy
Yeah
You slept with her for seven years after that
Look, it's just a little more complicated
What
Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much
Uh-huh
ha haaaah
Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley
You slept with Jason
You'd already broken up
How long
A couple hours
There he is
Where
Right- where we've been looking all night
He is so cute
Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman
Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic
All things considered, you had fun tonight
Where's my puck
No
It's not that big a deal
Am I right
You guys can pee standing up
All right, I'm tryin' that
How you get any work done is beyond me
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night
No plans, huh
You just gotta do it
Be a man, just stop calling
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you
Tony
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony
He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible
That guy, he burns me up
He called me young lady
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again
Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her
You look good
That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs
Guess who's doing laundry there too
Who
Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here
Don't you have a laundry room in your building
Anyway, say, sevenish
I'm with Bob now
Who the hell's Bob
You said let's just be friends, so guess what
What
You know, as friends
Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet
What
Eww
If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me
Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through
You're going on a date
Nuh-uh
Yuh-huh
I should shave again, pick up some wine, what
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener
Ok, I can pick something else up on the way
Short
Yep
Which
Which what
You've never met Bob, have you
Where are they
We never do anything just the two of us
Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies
Here we go
I had the most supremely awful day
What
Whatever you want
That's it
Yeah, it was really hard
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal
Move, move
I was kinda using that machine
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not
I put my basket on top
Unfortunately, I don't see suds
What
What's goin' on
That horrible woman just took my machine
Was your basket on top
Yeah, but, there were no suds
So
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it
I can't even send back soup
What's that
I'm a laundry virgin
Brooklyn Heights
Cleveland
How, how did that happen
Oh my god
What
So, you and Angela, huh
Pretty much
Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel
Huh, I never really noticed
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific
He's unbelievable in bed
My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity
Lee-lo, the laundry's done
Oh, everything's pink
I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone
Oh my god
What
cocktails in Appalachia
Come on, they're close
I mean
Oh my god, what were you thinking
He likes you
Really
Ow
Are you ok
La la la la la la la
I'm fine
Here she comes
How do you do that
It's like a gift
We should always always break up together
Now that's the important part
We had this cart
Uh, this is our cart
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules
Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen
Are you sure
Oh, are you sure you're ok
Yeah
Does it still hurt
Hi
Hey, how'd it go
Excellent
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves
I'm free
Feels like two
No, ten o'clock
Hel-lo
She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men
She's not with anyone
Blarrglarrghh
She's a person, you can do it
He could never get a woman like that in a million years
You could do that
Y'think
Yeah
I'm very very aware of my tongue
You had a beard
You had a beard
What is it
Maybe they wanna sign me
Hey, kids
How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'
Tell me one of your stories
just for the hell of it
more or less
All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is
'We' would be me and Rick
Who's Rick
Who's Rick
My husband
Ooooohhh
Oh, so you're divorced
No
Hopefully
I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan
There's, there's an Ethan
boyfriend
I suppose mainly sexual
Hm
I'm sorry it didn't work out
Didn't you listen to the story
How could you get involved with a woman like this
I mean, this is every guy's fantasy
Fine, alright, now you'll never know
C'mon, tell us
C'mon
Tah-daaah
'Cause I like that
And we're not supposed to ask
Well, whaddya think
Terrific
I-I see you moved the green ottoman
Uh-oh
How-how did that happen
I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out
That is so unfair
When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy
But hey, I can be a kook
The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away
Why not
Instead you wait until they send you a notice
One might wonder
Whoah
Well, what's the part
This whole courtroom's out of order
Seriously, what-what's the part
You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what
This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big
This is a big break for me
I need to borrow some moisturizer
For what
Today's the big day
His mom's on the phone
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity
Lose the robe
Me
Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing
Well, I'm- I'm showering
No, that was clenching
I think his butt would be angry here
What was that
God, I love these fingers
Thank you
Okay
Don't go
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick
It's not Rick
He got to spend the whole day with you
No, that's not exactly what I was
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us
So what do you want
You
You have me
Nono, just you
Whaddyou mean
Lose the other guys
all of them
C'mon, we're great together, why not
and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too
Get out
Which one
Nope
It felt like a 'big guy' moment
I got fired
Oh
My mom will
disturbing about that
And I finally get my shot, and I blow it
Maybe this wasn't your shot
feel like your shot
Hard to tell, I was naked
I'm gonna go to bed, guys
Night
Hi everyone
Hello
What
wth Jll Gdcr
What's up man
Alright, somebody
on a pool table
Whoooaa
That's my sister
the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library
Milwaukee
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All
No way
Oh come on, I already went
You did not go
Step back
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line
Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course
Come on
Passion is way overrated
Yeah right
I don't think that's going to be you
You don't
big passion in your future
Really
Mmmm
You do
I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to
Shhhh
Ahhhh
Would you like some gum
Are you going to do it
I'm going to do it
Do you want any help
You come out there, you're a dead man
Hey, where are you going
Outside
You can't go out there
Why not
the reason
And that would be
About what
He's planning your birthday party
About what
My surprise party
What surprise party
Well, he didn't tell me
I'm always the last one to know everything
this is so nice
ment
OK
Sorry, that was wax
We should find his owner
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall
Give me my cat
What's his name
B-Buttons
Bob Buttons
Italy, I think
Into our lives
I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere
He was Paolo's cat
Wha-What did he say that was so funny
I have absolutely no idea
we're kind of a thing
Thing
Thing
have the sex
um
Bed
way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad
Oh
Se vice
Si
So you do know a little English
a leetle
Do you know the word crapweasel
No
Now watch, it's easy
Thank you
Thanks
Well, this has been fun
Hey gorgeous, how's it going
does it get better than this
Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'
Do you want a date Saturday
Yes please
He's cute, he's funny, he's-
Can you believe she actually thought that
any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me
I did
Yeah, I think so, yeah
Not me
Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did
Did you tell her I wasn't
So, uh, what is it about me
Right
WHAT IS IT
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality
So, uh, how's she doing
The doctor says it's a matter of hours
How-how are you, Mom
What's with your hair
What
What's different
Nothing
She is unbelievable, our mother is
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse
How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants
She looks so small
I know
What is going on
Well, she's not, quite
What
She may have died
She may have died
So, um, did she
Twice
Twice
Oh, that sucks
You guys okay
I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone
Nono, she's gone
Thanks
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket
When my time comes-
Dad
When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea
You what
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun
Define fun
You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch
Gee, that does sound fun
Huh
That's probably what they'll say
Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake
Phew
what do you think it is about me
you just have a-a
Quality, right, great
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple
Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with
He's cute
's'no Brian in Payroll
Is Brian
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league
No
You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one
That's really a day shoe
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier
No, it really should be burgundy
Unless we go with a different dress

Really
Yeah
So- you can tell

So you don't think I have a, a quality
By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is
An advance

But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar
So you're free Thursday, then

Well, I'm off to Carol's
Hi, is uh, is Carol here
No, she's at a faculty meeting
Come in
What's it look like
Kinda like a big face without skin
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby
crazy
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there
you really talk to it
I want the baby to know my voice
Do you uh, do you talk about me
Yeah, yeah, all the time
Really
Not that I believe any of this
Oh my god, oh, you guys are great
What, what, what is it with you and this holiday
All right, I'm nine years old
Oh, I hate this story
Oh my god
We uh, we used to work together
Yeah, right
You're the best in the business
Get out
You know when to spritz, when to lay back
You don't know what that means to me
What's wrong
I just remembered, I have to do something
What
Um, leave
So I guess you all saw it
Saw what
My entire family thinks I have VD
It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen
Just get out of my way and stop moping
Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop
Oh, you must stop shooping
I don't see any tater tots
That's not a question
It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease
Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots
Ah
Underdog has just gotten away
The balloon
I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me
I can't, I gotta go
How often does that happen
Almost never
or Got the keys
Just aim for the bump
I feel stupid
Why are we standing here
You got the keys
No I don't
When we left, you said, "got the keys
I asked, "got the ke-eys
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys"
Oh, I gotta get my ticket
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key
Well then get it, get it
You're just happy you don't have gills anymore
You can sing to it if you want
I did
Does it always, uh--
No, no that was the first
Nope, not that one
Can you go any faster with that
You do the math
I swear you said you had the keys
Why would I have the keys
Aside from the fact that you said you had them
But I didn't
Well, you should have
Why
Because
Why
The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys
This was nobody's first choice
So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner
Stop it, stop it, stop it

The bigger half
That's so sweet
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas
And a crappy New Year
Oooh
You wanna say hi
No, no, I don't
Where did you get him
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab
I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so
I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman
Hey, buddy
So, how'd it go
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job
You were Santa last year
He's not even jolly, it's all political
So what are you gonna be
Yeah, you wish
Just the six of us- dinner
Alright
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
Did I just share too much
Just a smidge
He's very methodical
I think it's romantic
Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman
Yeah
She's gonna break the pact
What
This was your pact
That-that was like the worst breakup in history
He's playing with my spatulas again
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right
Do you always have to bring him here
I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you
Okay, alright, I have a question, then
Yuh
Sure
And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella
trapped inside a physicist's body
Rrrreally
You should just do it, just sweep and throw me
Now
What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you
Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby
Yeah
You know more than one Fun Bobby
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates
Uh, four
Four
Paolo's catching an earlier flight
We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who
Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now
He's walking around all the time dragging his hands
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night
Really
that juggling thing is amazing
what juggling thing
I figured you taught him that
No
Hi
Hey, do you know everybody
Have you seen David
No, no, he hasn't been around
We are going to Minsk
Minsk
It's in Russia
I know where Minsk is
Three years, all expenses paid
So when, when do you leave
Hello
Hey
Thank you
So-so you're really not going
I just- you decide
Oh don't do that
Please

Oh, but I can't do that-
No, but I can't-
It's your thing, and-
-make the decision-
Okay, um, stay
Stay
Hi
Par-tay
That thing is not coming in here
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table
Where-where's Paolo
Jerk missed his flight
Wow, that's, uh, dirty
Oh, no
Are you alright
You're going to Minsk

You can't stay here just 'cause of me
You seen Sandy
Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you
And the moment of joy is upon us
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out
I hate that
I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight
I can't kiss anyone
So now everybody's getting kissed but me
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news
Why
Whistle
We are not going to whistle
Come on, do it
No
Do it
No
Maybe nobody's tried this
I bet he's a lawyer
That means he's artistic
And- he can dance
I wish all guys could be like him
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two
He doesn't have anyone
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible
Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax
No way, forget it
C'mon, she's your mom
I think she's a blast
You can say that because she's not your mom
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome
Last night
Just a dream I had- but, phew
She's on
Your mom was arrested
Now why would she say that's embarrassing
Awww
He could be a Glen

You have got yourself a book
What is with you tonight
It's the one he's licking
She's supposed to be with you
I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing
C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off
When
You know who our hero is
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing
No, it's you
Please
You're smart, you're sexy
Right
No big deal
Okay
You broke the code
What code
What are you guys doing out here
But, um, apparently, somebody overslept
She's, she's sexy, she's
You don't think my mom's sexy
You think it's easy giving birth to seven children
Hey
Hey
What're you guys doing out here
Well, not playing raquetball
He forgot to leave his grip size
He didn't get the goggles
Goodbye, baby
So are you gonna tell him
Why would I tell him
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might
he's not even wearing a jockstrap
Hi
Hi
What are you doing here
y'know, so what are you doing here
Oh my God
I-I had to tell you
y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing
Me neither, y'know what-
I'm still mad at you for not telling me
Hey
Hey
Hello
Hello
Going to the hospital tonight
No, you
No, you
I cannot believe we're having this conversation
Two sets of lips
She's always been a Freudian nightmare
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something
We done now
You're awake
How, how do you feel
Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay
You look good
Who are you
I've been taking care of you
Well, we both have
So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys
Well, actually it's just from me

Oh, my pleasure
You're welcome
I guess I'll see you around
What, that's it
"See you around
Well, what do you want me to say
"I'll call you
Alright, I'll call you
I don't think you mean that
Anything you want from Lisbon
Really stupid
Are we okay now
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door
He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything
You're kidding
He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom
That makes more sense
Whaddya see
You okay, kiddo
Hey
How'd it go
Couldn'ta gone worse
Well, howdya feel
Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'
What's a 'niffle'
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist
Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those
That's it
So, did I hear Poconos
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend
Woo-hoo, first weekend away together
Yeah, that's a big step
Need a new table
Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Susan
So, so, did you hear
ok, what did we think it was going to be
That's the rule
There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table
Ok, ok, How about if we split it
What do you mean, like, buy it together
Yeah
You think we're ready for something like that
Why, are you moving out
I'm not moving out
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here
Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh
Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts
Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here
All right, you know Paolo
I'm familiar with his work, yes
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow
Ooooohh
My God
Was it
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there
"Ooo," what
Uma Thurman
Oh
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her
That's where I went
That's patio furniture
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something
You pick one
All right, how about the ladybugs
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had
Which proves that I never lie
I guess you don't
So, what do you think
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen
Are you okay
" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed
No I'm sorry
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about

Such a pig
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
Oh he's like a
He's like a big disgusting

pig man
The end
Oh, God
Should I not have told you
You could be on the Olympic standing-there team
Come on, two on one
She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in
What, now
Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye
Hey
Hey
You all right

Oh

I just got to figure out what I want
What
I-I'm, I'm having a boy
Wha-
Wha-
What is it
I-I'm having a boy
Hey
Come on, one more game
30 in the morning
You just barge in here, you don't knock
I'm sorry
This is ridiculous
Can I just say one thing
What
nipular areas
Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower
That's pretty much it
Oops
But you tell it really well, sweetie
Okay, now go away so we can talk about you
I'll miss you
Isn't he great
And he seems to like you so much
And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know
So, you think you'll do it on his couch
Anybody else
Okay
Did I, uh, did I miss something
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies
Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies
I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops
What'd you mean by that
Huh
Parents divorced before you hit puberty
Uhhuh, how did you know that
Hey, you all know my dad, right
Trib
Oh, this is my friend Roger
Hi
Good to meet you, Roger
Since then
Y'ever been in love
I d'know
And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women
Please tell me one of 'em is Ma
Did you not get a good enough look the other day
Y'know, I don't see that happening
Tit for tat
What's the matter with Rog
Yeah
I hate that guy
Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail
Why
Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you
Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing
I don't feel guilty for her failures
So you think I'm a failure
Isn't he good
Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying
Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in
Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie
Listen, thanks for everything, Mon
You're welcome
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered
Dad, Ronni's here
Huh
Hi
Uh
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk
I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train
I don't want you taking that thing
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here
Who-ah-ho
No you won't
No we won't
I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you
And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend
You're, uh, you're a good kid
That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late
This has gone on long enough
What kinda change
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
I can't do that
This is not right
Yeah, but this is
What're you doing
I can't sleep in my underwear
Well, you're gonna
Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes
Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking
No
You really think so
Hi
who are you
The mistress
Oh, c'mon in
Hi
Bathroom's up there
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing
Hey
How's it going
So what's going on
It's Roger
I dunno, there's just something about
Basically we just feel that he's
We hate that guy
No, we hate him
Hold on, you-you knew
Please
So then how could you I mean, how could you
I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby
I mean, what about you
I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary
for you
I just want it the way it was
I just did what I thought you'd want
Did you see her
You're ten times prettier than she is
What's wrong, sweetie
In that, um, they don't
They don't
They just think you're a little
What
Intense and creepy
Oh
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way
So you talked to your dad, huh
which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today
Wow
Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes
How's it going
Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger
Awww
Yeah, right
Aaawwwwww
What the hell were you doing
We just live in the same building
Any contact
She lent me an egg once
You're in
Thanks
I think it's winning
I think it's insane
Think it'll work
You can not do this
Do what, do what
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night
Don't you remember why you dumped the guy
I know I do
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight
Very nice
And what did you bring
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window
Just calm down
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney
We're good people
Maybe we're some kinda magnets
That's why I can't wear a digital watch
There's more beer, right
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald
It's perfect
Ok, well, what kind of ritual
We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us
Or
or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks
Burning's good
So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads
That's OK
Uh, we might be leaving now
Ok, you can not do this to me
So
Just us
A big screen TV
Can you believe this happened
Who are they
close, personal friend
You mean they're lovers
If you wanna put a label on it
Wow, uh, anything else I should know
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine
No
Eww
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day
You dumped her on New Year's
Wanna come over and join us
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control
You're our third call tonight
Really
I just don't things are gonna work out
Because I know that this isn't the end
Oh no, you see, actually it is
Oh, no I don't
Who asked who into whose bed
I did, but
Her coat is gone
Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years
Sorry, that's not funny
But
No but, no but
The right woman is just waiting for you
That's easy for you to say, you found one already
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then
So, um, will you bring the truck
I'll even let you ring the bell
Oh, my god
See, there you go, the cleansing works
They're nice guys
You guys tell them you were married
No way
Yeah
And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you
Hey

Why
So was it a lot more money

Uh, you left out the stupid part
You scared the crap outta me
Was that the cake
I got a lemon schmush
Hey, what's going on

Oh
See the von Trapp kids
Nope
That's because I'm in front of them
I thought that was an alp

It was just four years of parties and dating and sex
Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice
Salty
He's looking right at us
Oh, that is so sick
We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games
Her answer machine
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up
So, uh, why didn't you say anything
No, don't everybody look at once
Okay, okay, what's going on
Okay, they're just talking
Does he look like he was just told to shove anything
Oh my God, don't do that
How'd it go

I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar
Duh, where've you been

What kinda stuff
I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked
You cook naked
What's the matter
Oh, Barry, this was not good
It was very very good
Well, what about Mindy
Oh, way, way better than Mindy
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy
Well, if you want, I'll just - I'll just break it off with her
Come on, this is all way too

How many beeps
She answered

I said that a little too loudly, didn't I
You-you had what
Sex in his chair

I feel so
Naughty
Will you watch my phone
Why don't you just take it with you

Why don't you just call her
I have some pride
Don't you have to pee
Mindy

Of course
Oh that's so great
Was that all you wanted to ask me

She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies
You're not an artist
Pepponi
Stalin
It sounds familiar
I think you'd remember that
Hey
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is
I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing
What d'you think
May I help you
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe
You just click when they click
It's gym class all over again
Who's the new tense girl
She's your partner
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch
Hey
Where've you been
At the vet
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent
So what does this mean
This sucks
How can he be an adult already
Isn't there any way you can keep him
I've just gotta get him into a zoo
How do you get a monkey into a zoo
No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen
Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility
We found her, we found the girl
What
Did you call the cops
We took her to lunch
Your own brand of vigilante justice
She's a stealer
I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader
Take off their hats
No way did you do this
Monana was very brave
Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show
'Scuse me
Whaddya say
I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class

Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right
Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned
Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society
Uh-huh
See, how can nobody want him
You're kidding
You'd think you would've known that
Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be
Yes
Does he, uh, fight with other animals
No-no, he's, he's very docile
cornered
Why
Uh, how is he at handling small objects
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean
How about a hammer, or a small blade

How-how did you know I was here
That I was not expecting
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in
Thanks
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'
Not necessarily
I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing
Um, I'm not actually Amish
You in the back, you're getting it all wrong

At gate 27-B
Oh, why
Who is it

And then we've gotta get some sleep
Yeah, sure
Did you talk to him
Not yet
You know whose voice that was
God
It was you, pal
Well, maybe it was God, doing me
I didn't order lemonade
Without any outside help whatsoever
How is that the silver lining
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking
No, although now that's what I'm thinking
No
Why not
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak
Needs some clothes altered
She didn't hang up either
I'll just call her back
What's goin' on

Can we see her
How're you doing
I'm okay
Ooh, that bad, huh
What
What about Julie
took advantage of me
What
I've been going to the guy for 12 years
What
Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test
No-no-no-no
You are way too good to be with a guy like that
Oh, I can do that
Really
Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes
Ok, thank you
Ladle
That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it
Carol
Sure
Uh, does it hurt
So, uh, how often can you do it
As much as he needs
Yeah, I forget which ones
Anybody else want one
So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it
I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet
Ok, um, I'll go with you
Hey, sweetums
Hello to the rest
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal
I really appreciate this
You're welcome
So did you hear about the new guy
Who
What's he doin' in my section
Your territory, huh
Bijan for men
No thanks
You were with me, and we were shopping all day
What
We were shopping, and we had lunch
What did I have
You had a salad
What'd you buy
Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur
Oh, this is so cute
Oh, I got that for him
Did you just say Hi, Jew
What did you just do
I licked my arm, what
It's breast milk
What did you just do
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk
You won't even taste it
No
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk
Hey, where is everybody
Where've you been
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket
Who'd you have lunch with
Judy
Who
Julie
What
Jody
shopping
Oh my God
It didn't mean anything to me
That is not true
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here
I did not freak out
Why'd you freak out
This should be fun
I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults
It doesn't taste bad
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh
Cantaloupe juice
Uh huh
Oh, you've tasted it
Yeah I guess you're right
I don't know what else to say
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening
I feel terrible, I really do
Yes
I heard ya
You boys ready
Ready
You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing
What the hell did you do
Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now
So
Me
Well, you're not totally paranoid
Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something
I'd love it
So, I'll talk to you later
Hey
So how was Joan
I broke up with her
When she sneezed, bats flew out of them
Come on, they were not that huge
It made me nuts
You or me
You guys are messin' with me, right
Yeah
For a second there, I was like, "whoa
You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason
Maureen Rosilla
Heckles
You're doing it again
We're not doing anything
It's disturbing my birds
You don't have birds
I could have birds
Heckles, we'll try to keep it down
I'm going to rejoin my dinner party
There, faster
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise
We won
Heckles
How did this happen
They found a broom in his hand
That's terrible
You never know
You never know
Such as
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution
What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution
Not really
You don't believe in evolution
Yeah, I just don't buy it
Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity
Ok, don't get me started on gravity
It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed
He'd like to talk to you
What can we do for you
Well, what about his family
He didn't have any
Ok, so let's talk money
You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two
This is his final revenge
Have you ever seen so much crap
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
Can I have this
How can you not believe in evolution
You can literally see them evolving through time
You can actually see it
, China, Africa, all over
See, I didn't know that
Well, there you go
So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why
"My Big Book of Grievances
It doesn't go with any of my stuff
Well, what about my stuff
You don't have any stuff
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you
No
Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts
Please tell me you're joking
Is there blood coming out of my ears
Heckles' high school yearbook
Wow, he looks so normal
He's even kind of cute
You're the funniest kid in school
Heckles
That's what it says
Would you listen to that
I'd call that excessive
Whoa
What
Big deal
Would you knock it off
Have you been here all night
Hermit Junction
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go
How
When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays
I mean, what if we're at her folks' place
Yeah, I understand
Every year, all right

Helloo
Oh, my, god
Geez, look how fat she got
Yes, I am
Is it--
You are looking at a married lady now
Congratulations
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry
You couldn't have told me about this on the phone
You know what we haven't played in a while
What
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish
Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps
There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility
I can't believe you caved
What
So who's hungry
Let me just get my coat
I'm gonna die alone
And now I have to get a snake
"Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout
You're not gonna end up alone
You're a guy
You are no different than the rest of them
You are totally different
In a bad way
That's how much you wanted to be with someone
You made it
You're there
You are ready to make a commitment
Don't know about that
Something else that's not yours that you can break
I think it'll look good in our apartment
Thank you
That's fine
I'm growing
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you
I'll take that
You want his yearbook
I think somebody should have it
You're all going to hell
It's really not that big
Takin' that with you, huh
Oh, yeah
You comin'
We'll try to keep it down
Hi
I mean, what the hell were you thinking
Huuh
Well, didn't you

I can't believe you didn't tell me
Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything
What have I not told you
You have a third nipple
You bitch
Whip it out, whip it out
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples
Let me see it again
Huuh
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me
You were in a porno
Yeah, is there a hair on it
You get the best huts and women dance naked around you
Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area
But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it
Woah

Technically, huh, no
Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school

All right, fine

You can tell us
Ok

We can talk about that
Let's
I, I just never think of money as an issue
That's 'cause you have it
That's a good point
The thing's not the gift
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish

All of us
Together
Not at the concert
Ok

It's our treat
Thank you
Could you be less enthused
But it just feels like--
Like
Charity
Charity
Actually, it makes us feel that big
I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys
Maybe that's just how you feel
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel
Me neither
Me too
Why did you look at me when you said that
Well, I guess now we can't go
Do we always have to do everything together
You're right

Well, that makes me feel so good
I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this

My brother has a slight phobia about needles
Ohhh

Hey
Oh, hi

Thank you
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well
Do you
So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat
And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat"
From who
And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite
It's kind of an emergency
Here you go
And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand
I'm sorry I poisoned you
Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand
What do you think this is, a freckle
But I remember people telling me about it
I hope Ben has a little sister
I hope she can kick his ass
Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken
That was you
He wouldn't have made it
There's still pie
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today
How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt
You, you are gonna love this
Come here
It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat"
Smelly cat, smel-ly cat

And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song
Yeah
You wanna try it again
From the top
Um, why don't you just follow me
Ok
Mmmm hmmm
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault
about me
So, how was the party
OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive
Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight
Please
Yeah
Five more and I'll flash you
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night
Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice
The guy still won't put out, huh
Zilch, nothin', uh-uh
He's not British
gay
definitely felt something
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look
Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity
So you really OK about all this
Hi guys
Uh, actually, we're getting a cat
Together
Uh huh
Both of you
Yep
y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something
Ahh
I mean he just started going out with her
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend
OK, Michael, let's talk about you
Alright
So, I figured it out
What
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack
Fruitflies
So, would you like any dessert
No dessert, just a check, please
gosh, why can't I do that
You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure
Hang on
Hello, excuse me
What
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute
Why not
It's God's day
OK, if you say stop, then we stop
Ahhhh
And how was the date
Did you call me
No, I stayed at Julie's last night
Huh
you're uh, you're, you're over me
Ohh, ohh
You've had feelings for me
You had feelings for me first
when did he
When you were in China
China
Meeting Julie
and now, now, now you're over me
Wait, so, you're going
I'm gonna go get a cat
Hey Phoebs
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did
And
And we did
All right Phoebs, way to go
Yay me
So, so how did it happen
Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on
I convinced him
Um-hum
Hi
I didn't get a cat
Oh, that's um, interesting
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you
You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie
Then you should have said something before I met her
And how come you never said anything to me
There was never a good time
We only hung out every night
Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point
Fine
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship
We're not working out, it's over
We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'
OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret
What
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have
Well, thanks
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on
Y'know, I try to stay positive
So, you feel like goin' for a run
Alright
If you want, you could just take a nap right here
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
It was unbelievable
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
Oh, it ended very well
And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it
Or was his hand like on your back
And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair
And, uh, and then I kissed her
Tongue
Yeah
s
Hi
how'd you make out last night
Wait, yeah, that's just painful
I thought last night was great
How are you
How are you
Ok, all right
Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses
Muy impressivo
The ad wasn't too clear
Mockolate
I'm sorry
It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute
Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday
Wow
Aren't you going to swallow that
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling
Really
How about Mockolate mousse
It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse
What makes it pilgrim
Hey
Hey
No, I'm sorry
I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare
Can't we just use a pen
No, Amish boy
I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes
You could say that
What else
I don't know
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby
Oh my god
Oh my god good
It's um the other thing
Well, uh
Well, go hug her, for god's sakes
Really
Oh, god
Ohhh
Let me get my coat
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing
Then let me read it
No
Come on
You're the worst writer in the whole world
Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok
Spoiled
He was supposed to type "little", the idiot
Just a waitress
You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency
What a dinkus
What
What
Oh good, I was hoping that would come up
This was your idea
You believe in that karma crap, don't you
It's your pro list
You wanna open the window
What are you doing out there
I am, uh, I am
No
No
That's what I said
Look, maybe we should go
Doesn't matter
What
Something about laboratory rats

You wanna hear something funny
Oh God, yes
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village
ridiculously dull Bobby
God
It's not that bad
Did you hear the hammer story
OK, OK, don't get all squinky

You actually don't see it

Oh God, you fell off the wagon
Oh, no, no, it's about you

Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends
Take care
What happened

Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes
Hi
Oh, hey

She hates him
Hey
Hey

Hi
So how did everything go
There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it
Well, we've gotta go
It's about us
Oh, you and me
Uh, no, Susan and me
The other us
Ok
We're uh, we're getting married
I had fun at the first wedding
Look I just thought that
I'm revelling baby, believe me
Is your finger caught in that chair
Mmm hmmm
Want us to go
You're actually gonna be on television
Are you really not going
If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself
Whoa, she's pretty
She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting
I'm sorry, what
Is she gonna be all right
Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee
Nice
That's great
Excellent
Do it again
"Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart
No no, that's me
Oh, yeah
Oh, hello

One of my clients died on the massage table today
Oh my god
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get
Adelman
Oh, honey
What do you mean
I can't decide between lamb or duck
Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks
Ok, who ordered what
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf
Oh god
Mom
But I guess that's the fun
Oh Mom
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink
Believe me, sometimes that happens
I am just so proud of you
Really
Yes
Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello
I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want
me
Well, not just for you
Well, what do you mean
I think I'm gonna be sick
It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them
And you had no idea they weren't getting along
None
They didn't fight a lot
Hey, look who's up
I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this
I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you
But in your case it's actually kinda true
That's him
Thanks for meeting me
Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting
Um, do you wanna sit
You're saying, my wife is in you
Everything

So, what's new in sex
What's new in sex
The only man I've ever been with is your father
Do you want my blessing
No
You want me to talk you out of it
No
What do you want
I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this
Why on earth would I understand this
I did
Oh
I thought you had this all planned out
Do you wanna see me cry
All right, ball the melon
Hi
Fine, whatever
What's the matter
I think we're calling off the wedding
What
Or something a little less selfish
What happened
My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming
They're supposed to give me away and everything
I don't know what to do
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right
You do
And you don't have to be too emphatic about this
Of course I do
Do it
Of course you're right
So we're back on
We're back on
I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly
Would you look at them
I miss Rose

It's me
Hi
I was told you had a question
I can't believe this
' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today
Well, ya know, someone should have called me
Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture
Zoo dollars

And she's not crazy
Drake Remore
Oh my God
He's the one who wants to boff the maniac
You OK
That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired
Are you gonna kiss me
Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing
Who's they
No one
Is anyone here a doctor
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes
But, um, zoo dollars
Alright, look, I got to tell you something
Drake Remore
But that's what
Excellent
Very informative
Not at all inappropriate
There're cookies in the back
That was great, the kids loved you
Yay, I rock
You were incredible
But
How did you know there was a but
I can do that
Really
Yeah
You wanna kiss me
Buddy, my monkey
Your monkey was taken
But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead
Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya
That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me
Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes
That guy Lipson
Do you have any idea who else knows
No, I, I only know Lipson
Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with
Of course
That's all I know
This is unbelievable
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend
Are you trying to get me to bribe you
Maybe
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales
You're the only one who can save her Drake
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God
It's Erica

How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem
What's up
Is she here, huh, huh
Who

I just pretend to be a doctor
Do the people at the hospital know about this
How, how can you be here and there
'Cause it's a television show
Drake, what're you getting at
I'm not Drake
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin
Is all this true
Yo evil twin
Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth
No
I see
Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs
I'm not saying you have to be Barney
You're kidding
This is amazing
I know
Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year
I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey
I'm sorry guys, closed set
We uh, we used to live together
Woah, dude, burn
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard
Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set
Jerry is the director, which one's he
The one in the director's chair
Phoebs, walk with me
Is he lookin', is he lookin'

Oh that's me, I gotta go
So what'd he say
I mean, naturally, you know, I said no
Well, thanks anyway

If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself
That is so unfair
He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours
You're blowin' me off for a monkey
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday

Alright, let me just get my coat
They'll take care of you next door
Is it true they have beer
You want me to see a therapist
You work and you work and you work on a boat
He always ridiculed my pottery classs
and you sand it and you varnish it
but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs
and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County
the scotch and the cigarettes
and the bansai's and the chiuaua
I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but
And you be sure and send me that finished poem
Your mom want's to say goodbye
Oh ok

Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster
Give it to me
No
You went out with a guy in the Navy
Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man

Oh no
Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it
Well I've had it
Yeah, I've had it

This isn't camp
Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown
What're you doing
Just waiting for you sweetie
Are you remaking the bed
You know what, the way you did it was just fine
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy
Oh, well that's not so crazy
I'm just easing you in
Oh, alright
You don't love me any more do you
But don't you need experience for a job like that
People want the processing, I'm the one they call
Where do you work
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you
For god sakes, dim the lights
Hey Ryan, what's up
I, I have the pox
Chicken or small
Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian
Why aren't you at home in bed
I'm sorry, I never had 'em
I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now
Can I please see your face
You don't want to see a face covered with pox
Hey
Hey, how's the first day goin'
It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column
Well there you go
I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie
Small world huh
I figure my character has kids
Ashley copies everything Brittany does
Just did
You know what makes the itching even worse
That you don't stop talking about it
Are you scratching
This is what I do for luck, ok
Give me the dice
No
No
Give it
Oh God help me
Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it
Hope the baby feels better
Douglas

Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers
Why

I taped oven mits to their hands
You're strict
Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle
Very good
Thank you
Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks
You're gonna do what to my clocks
I'm gonna set them to my time
You wanna know why

No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now
Come on tell me
See you don't understand
Come on
You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things
That is not true
Oh yeah
Yeah
Alright, well tell me one of yours
What if they get mixed up
My boyfriend doesn't have a thing
Douglas is looking for you
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that
Anyway, I just thought you should know
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph
I think he's a brown-nosing suck up
You know why, 'cause he's not in your department
So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife
I just did
In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer
Really
No freakshow, she's fictional
If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else
Oh look, a low budget puppet show

You look beautiful
What's up

Yeah

Or so I would have you believe
Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet
Oh my God, you're a freak
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to

Hey, are you okay
My wife's a lesbian

What
You missed the exit
Oh, sorry
' But of course this went in one ear and out
If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda

Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't
Trib
Hey-hey
Guess what, I got an audition
I'm so proud
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it
What's the part
You couldn't just leave it alone
So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice
Varoom
This is not the bed I ordered
When did I sign for it
Did you make brownies today

That was really good
You told him to play the boxer gay
Well, I-I might've said supergay
Thanks for dinner last night
Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson
What
What's with the neck
That's what I keep saying
Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor
Uh
Bobby
Well that's his last name
And his first name
He's Bobby Bobby
It's Robert Bobby
Oh
And um, excuse me, he helps me
Ask her how
What do you need help for
I've got one leg shorter than the other
Oh God
Argue with that
I know that
So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for
I'm sorry, let her
What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either
Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance
No
Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice
Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king
I've got a good one
I just, I, I can't see him
See that is the problem with invisible dentists
Why can't you go to him
And all these people actually died
It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence
I promise
I mean it'll, it'll just kill him
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you
Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you
Yeah
I've got a science question
Hmm
He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him
We're not
No we're not
All right, I like that
Push it in
I cannot push it in
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction
Okay, okay, okay
I got it
We could put a hat on his head
We need a hat
We need a hat
Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though
Give it
Oh

Come in here with me
I would like to get her something serious
Why not

What is the thing
They were in his office
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me

Why are your eyes so white
Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you
Oh my God
All right
In the park
How many kisses were there
Just those two
You said number two
Hi
How's my little boy
Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded
I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive
Uh
And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big
Well maybe he's just taking a nap
I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning
All right, we should call somebody
The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive
There's no way
Yeah
Well, now we got a reason
What
Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device
All right
Oh my God, is she going back to him
And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept
What are you ah, what are you gonna do
What, what, would you do
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do
About that ah, bump on his head
I'm saying you have to watch them all the time
Yeah
Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today
' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head
Okay
Wow
It's the right thing to do
Then don't leave me
What
Pick me
I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance
No
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance
He's a-live
And yet, we're still poking him
Okay, retract the device, retract the device
He does not look happy
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device
Oh
I know
I know
I've found
That would be sooo much fun
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play
Come on
Yeah, all right, I'll play
Yay
What
Your mom
And just keep running
And was the curse lifted
That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again
I mean come on, it's been twelve years
Let's bring it in
All right, we have to pick captains
And then Tineals
Okay, so how do we decide that
Well, why don't we just bunny up

All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her
Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot
You're better with numbers and stuff
And sweetie
Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle
Well ah, you wanna just stay out there
Can I see that for second
This is my favourite jersey
Hey, I am good at math
Prepare to feel very bad about yourself
Touchdown
It doesn't count

Does so count
Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater
Oh my God

I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one
Wh-what
All right, bye
You just saved yourself a couple months of sex
We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls
We're not gonna lose to girls
It's 42-21
This sucks, I was just up by that much
You dated someone with a glass eye too
Let's kill 'um
They never cover me
Honey, there's a reason
Break
Break
Are you okay
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home
Huddle up
Let go
Maybe there's a like league we could join or something
Isn't there a national football league
Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights
I work Monday nights
Do you think we should bring them some
Let go
You let go
No
How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball
Gimme the this
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand

You broke a little girl's leg
I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees
I forgot I am totally against that now
Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh
He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me
Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win
The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five
Yeah
But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell
Well, that makes sense
Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble
Yeah, Sarah, anything
Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies
I can still see you
Destiny
Sure
Yes
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones
So, what happens to the old guys
All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities
No
Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this
I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff
I'm still pursuing that
Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago
You need the fear
Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here
Yeah
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular
Can't I just look at the handles on them
You would think
I'm gonna give you my weeks notice
What
I sold them all
You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes
So, how many have you sold so far
Five hundred and seventeen boxes
Oh my God, how did you do that
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya
On my computer
You wanna know what else is really funny
Ha
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear
So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview
Not a problem
Thanks
And now for the great news
Is this the one that I threw out last year
Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas
You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg
That was an accident, okay
You're a big scrud
What's a scrud
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud
Hi there
Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself
Oh God, you're the best
Excellent
Real magic does exist
Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling
Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor
He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything
All right, be my guest
Oh
God, it killed me
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon
I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy
' Eh
Op
Eh
Oh, you got me
How does that sound
It's not funny, this is actually my job
And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger
Ah, just one other thing
Hello-dillillio
Oh my
These are pure vodka
Hi
Wow
I know
What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason
Uh-huh
And he's, he's a total stranger
His name is um, Mark something
Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex
Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason
What are we drinkin' over here
Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer
Hi
Hi
Isn't that great
How ya feelin'
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it
We lost you after you opened up all the presents
Yeah
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone
Woooo hoooo
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing
What is the worse part
You don't think I thought of that
How can you not know which one
I mean that's unbelievable
I mean, was it Gina
Which one is Gina
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings
Dwha
I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat
That's okay
That's all right
With, with, witnesses
I just got off the phone with my sister
Ah, which, which one
Mary-Angela
Mary-Angela

It's gotta be the first one
You and my sister, sittin' in a tree
Did Mark call
Oh my God
So, how are you
Oh yeah, what's it about
When actually I'll be in Cuba
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela
What about you
It's Sunday night, and he didn't call
Yay
There you go
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it
I got to figure out what I'm going to wear
What
Are you crazy
This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal
No
I mean don't you trust her
Well, yeah
Did you make it Mary-Angela
I did
So Mary-Angela do you like it
It's her favorite
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite
More of Grandma's teramisu
It's top notch
That dies with me
So will I
Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom
God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips
Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela
No, I'm Mary-Theresa
I would never do anything like this ever again
I say, punch him
Punch him
Okay, absolutely
Hi

Thank you
Don't worry
God, I hope they kick his ass
Hey, what are you doing Friday
Y'know, botanists are such geeks
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles
I don't need that today

Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out
And there's a thermos in it
Why am I invited to this again
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer
What
Dickens gets to pick 'em
Who
I'll get you the Cliff Notes
The what
Any questions so far
What kind of discount do we get
It's, it's Mark
Oh hey, hey Mark
Hey, hold on a second
Okay
Hi honey
What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone
Oh, he's just goofing around
Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office
I told you we're Joanna's two assistants
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she
What did I just do
Please, I'm not going for anything
Well, if you don't, I will
Would you please go
Look Julio, someone left their book here
Ah actually, that is mine
Oh yeah, what are you reading
Lovely, just lovely
Excellent, I'll be there
Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition
Five years with the American Ballet Theater
I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either
Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem
I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me
Whoa, I'm not done
See you guys
You really think that is what he meant
Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too
Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend
I get it
I mean my God
You're hurt
I would never do that
He said this is what you guys do
Mark's a genius
How is he a genius
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you
Get off her
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands
Hey
What are you wrapping
Oh-ho, look what I got Julio
Yeah, it's a vase
Yeah, just like the one in the poem
Well not exactly like the one in the poem
You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me
Whoa, whoa, whoa
You don't even know me
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you
What
What was that
I know, it was the best I could get out of them
Well, people
Hello
A big idiot
Ohh, with who
Yeah
Why, is that okay
Sure, is she married
I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own
You are totally jealous
And y'know, and um, I
Honey, I love you too
Wait, wait, wait

No one likes a buttmunch
Six dollars, please
So, you look great
Right

It's good to see you
Yeah
I missed this
Me too
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea
I promise
No, I just I think that it's too soon
Yeah, baby
What are you doing
Do you want some
Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight
It's gonna be really late
Oh come on, not again
Okay
Hmm
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work
Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that
And what are you going to do for him
I'm going to let him
Okay
Hey
When did this happen
Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger
So, are you gonna see him again
Hey
Do you have any ice
It's late
How was your day
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer
How often do you read it
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again
But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining
All right, you got it
All right
Okay
Yeah
Oh, hey
Hi
Well, I'm from California

Robert's coming out
Is he gay

What
Coffee
Okay
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What do we do
Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say
Ew, this feels very weird
Oops
Okay
Gotta keep squishing
Tomatoes are squishing
Op
Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt
What
Umm, you've got some on your pants
Wow

Hey

You mean a three pointer
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty
So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages
You want a quarter
Hey
Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies

Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball
Oh

Don't sit down
You ready to go to the batting cage
And, first here's a gift
Hey

Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub
Hmmm, that's very cool
I can't believe you just did that
All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad
Beth, Beth dies
Um-hmm
If I keep reading is Beth gonna die
She doesn't die
Then why would you say that
What are you smiling at

We're still on this side of the door
Um-hmm
You mean like exclusive friends
Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed
That's not true, you don't have a moustache
I don't think I could do it again
What
Beth is really, really sick
Awwww
Yeah
This girl is good
Oo, I never thought of that before

No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house
Oooh
Yeah, Ginger something
When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did
Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner
You gave her food poisoning
Or, at least what I thought was a log
You threw Pepper on the fire
Oh damn, I hate that
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes
Oh, don't worry about it
No, really you're gonna freeze

Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark
Oh, well
Because, he's my friend
Am I supposed to be laughing
You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me
I would love to go with you
Really
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps
You obviously want to
You think you know me so well
Well, don't 'cha wanna
Yeah
Okay, well I do know you
That's what I said
Well so
Wow, that's great
Oh, yeah

No, no-no-no, no
You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie
I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car
So umm, how was your date with Ginger
She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness
Uh-huh
It came up
My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks
Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had
Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark
That's a little clearer
Your thinking about my leg aren't you
Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again
Am I wasting my time
I don't think so
What's that
That's-that's my nubbin
What's a nubbin
It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing
I, I just remembered I have to leave
And if I can't trust you then just forget it
No, no, I don't want to forget it
You okay
Wanna hear a new song
Yeah
Where have you been
The doctor

Two nipples, no waiting

Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN
I figure bodies at peace, make peace
So what country is this guy from
There's a 'g' in there

Oh, no thanks
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of
You wanna come

You should come
We'll be there
Oh
It's small
So you had fun, huh
Hey, honey
Oh, hi
Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there
I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there
30
What time is it now
30
Yeah all right, so we'll hang out
Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us
Vividly
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh
Yeah, I mean what, what would we do
Dude, I don't know
She was kidding
Yeah
Well ah, y'know we could flip for it
I told you I don't
Yeah, but wait
Hey
Look um, about what happened earlier
But I told you, I didn't have the time
No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job
Just a job
if you don't get that
Okay, I don't know what to do anymore
Well neither do I
Okay, it's not, it's not
Okay, what do you want me to do
And that's the only colour that comes in
I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight
He says he was too
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant
Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation
Is it my breath
Hi
You wanna talk, I mean I can come over
Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay
All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food
Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry
It's for me
So what are you gonna do
One person wants to break-up, you break-up
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny
What happened to him
Well, then he's, he's probably just, out
Hello

Come dance
Ah, that's okay, thanks
You just have to dance
Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner

How's the big anniversary dinner
Well, we never actually got to dinner
Ohhh, nice

'Cause how can they do that
Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest
Oh my God
Huh
' when I tell her what I did
How dumb are you
Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild
Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail
Was it not pain-free
Is this about me taking your watch
You took my watch
I'm sorry, I do that
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us
I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know
So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right
Oh, well I tell Issac everything
Y'know we haven't actually met
You dog
Listen, can you keep this information to yourself
We're the same, you and me
Actually, no, we're not
Yeah, we are
No, we're not
Yeah, we are
No, we're not
Okay, we're not
Right
But, we are
I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister
You did a bad thing
Yes, I did
Very bad
Very bad
Very, very bad
No
Okay
All right
Ow
Oh

Now
I wanna talk about this
What
How was she
Horrible
Not good
Ewwwww
Good different
I thought we were broken up
We were on a break
That to me is a break-up
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality
I thought our relationship was dead
And to have to hear about it from Gunther
I mean they have more important things to worry about
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza
It's organic
Oh great, food with hair on it
No, not the used wax
No anchovies
With ah, extra anchovies
You can have the last piece, if you want
You think I need a new walk
What
I think I need a 'take notice' walk
You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am
You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough
That's
That's what
They've been quiet for a long time
Maybe she killed him
Can I see the comics
This is the New York Times
He's meeting us here
Oh come on, they can be in the same room
Yeah, you shoulda been there last night
And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy
I had the same dream
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl
Oh, I had the opposite dream
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship
Hey
Let's get the show on it
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee

It'll be great for next weekend
So, for the whole weekend
He's my brother
What a pity stay
We can make fudge

Beam me up Jesus
There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab

Oh
You can go when we stop for gas
Come on, I really have to goooooooooo

Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us
Then why are you smoking

You slept with another woman
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air
Hey
Hi

No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no
He cannot come
Excuse me

All right, let's go
You're welcome
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else
That's what you said last night
Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here
Yeah

What, he's 18
Exactly, it'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party
So, um, how-how did you guys meet
I was in her ah, Home Ec class
And he was my best student
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will
And so now you guys are gonna be married
Great
Frank, are you sure you're ready for that
Right
Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there's an age difference between us
'Cause you were acting like you didn't
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out
Haven't you and I covered that topic
I mean really, think about it
Well, have-have you told him how you feel
Everything
I think you should definitely go out with this guy
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me
Hey
Do you have any Chap Stick
Uh, yeah
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya
Y'know what, pretty good
Yeah
Thank you
Here you go
That's Bill Clinton
Who's he huggin'
But why is Bill huggin' Pete
Every office in the world uses that program
We use it
Or incredibly offensive
All we're saying is don't rush into anything
You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88
You don't have it anymore
No, I ah, I slept with someone else
Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better
Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it
Well, I want it
You can have it
I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me
No
I got it
Then you hold on to it
Oh my God, who died on this
Can you help me
It's ruined
I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip
Is this the way you get girls to go out with you
I don't know
Why not
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour
Is that all right
So, how was your day
Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive
What umm, what happened
Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off
But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best
And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why
Okay
And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will
Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you
Okay, but

Hi
Hi
Hey
Oh-no-no-no-no
Hey, you like pizza
Oh, that's sounds great
You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza
Now is, is that enough lire
Ahh, I'd throw another thousand on that
Why, how much is that
There's someone here who can explain this better than I can
Hi Frank
Yeah, but not just that
Here you go
All right, let's go shoppin'
Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say
Oh, this is so great
Hello, people who do not live here
Hello
I gave you a key for emergencies
We were out of Doritos
Millionaire
Third wife sold separately
He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all
Still
He actually has everything
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image
Two
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play
Hi
Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh
Are you one of the retarded cousins
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh
She rocks
Where do I know you from
Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat

I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later
Okay
I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice
I have a question about this scene
Yes
Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor
First of all, he's good looking
Yeah
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that
It doesn't say that in the script
You're gonna get peep eye
We just broke up, first thing she does
You didn't just break up
Hey, it's been like three weeks
Okay
I, I can't see anything but the door closed
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave
I mean, I have, I have to stop it
You can't
People need juice
Look man
Juice, I need
It's over
Yeah, okay
Okay
Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom
Y'know what
And I don't think I'm gonna want to
I can't do this
Yep, that's what I didn't want to know
I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you
Right here
I'm sorry about this
That's okay
You sure
Sure
Just tell me the truth
Wasn't that like a year ago
Y'know what I mean
I know that
I so wanna be attracted to you
Okay, good
I'm sorry
This is not, don't be, 'cause it's not so bad
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth
' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good
Y'know
Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow
Well, that was ah

G'night
Ah, Kate
Yeah
Hey, listen you ah
Hmm

Yep
You ready to go
So umm, I'll see you tomorrow, huh
'Cause it's-it's not his last name
It isn't
Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have
Okay well, he would turn things to gold
What about things that are already gold
Ahh, his work is done
Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We were all pretty shaken up about it
'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way
You get the dollhouse
I get the dollhouse
No, just a barrel
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse
Really
It was to be looked at, but never played with
Hey
That's a great name
' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore
Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too
Uh, uh, uh, I am here
Hello
It's so beautiful
I know
So, I'm here, ready to play
What's this
That's a dog, every house should have a dog
Not one that can pee on the roof
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic
I don't want a ghost
That would never happen
Hello
I need to talk to you
Sure, what's up
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you
I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof
Hey, Kate
Morning
Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy
Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives
Get out of here, really
Absolutely
Yeah
Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft
I-I'll see you then
Hey
Hey
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse
What's this
And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed
All right
I would
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet
What
Did he tell you
Oh, I
Doesn't he have a good heart
Oh, I know
Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through
Isn't this great
Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating
And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with
Why, do you want me to care
Do you want me to want you to care
Do you
What do you say
I can't believe we go on in, in a week
What
At the place I told you about last night
Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh
I don't know
Well umm, maybe if it had more heat
How do you mean
Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know
Maybe he could slip her the tongue
Something like that
Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind
Hi
It's a little early to be drinkin'
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate
Ohhhhh
I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her
That's what you say at the end of a date
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night
Hasn't it ever happened to you
Well, they always called
Sorry
Why hasn't he called
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women
Why
Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss
Why should he feel awkward
Well then you're going to have to take her out again
That's fine
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know
Hey
Hi
Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall
About what
Y'know, about what happened with us
I-I was there, you're not that good an actress
Hi, Lauren
Hi, Lauren
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there
By the way, I was just checking the shower massager
Did everyone get out okay
It was, wasn't it
The food there was, was great
Wasn't it
So take care
Ahhhh - I'm not going to call you
Yeah, o-okay
So
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box
Oh my God, they took my idea
Oh my God, are you guys okay
No way
Who's gonna watch that
So ask me what I did today
So what did you do today Pete
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant
And you're still not attracted to him at all
I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade
He was you're health teacher
Honey
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday
Oh God, I'm so sorry
Ow

Excuse me
You don't think I get up when you get up
Ohhh, here it comes
Well I don't think so mister

And you don't think taking care of our chick is work
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick
I'll take her back tomorrow
Oh my God, is that still
I'm fine, I'm fine
No you're not
Look, either help me or go

Claws

Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company
And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too
It's all kinds of other animals
Well, you did the right thing man
I love spider burners
Did you just smell my hair
No
Oh God
What
You still have feelings for me don't you
I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all
Pete
Is that so bad
It's-it's really nice
That's why I can't take this job
What
I'm sorry
If that's, if that's really what you want, okay
Oh, it was, nah, well

But you said one
All right, I'll see you tonight
Okay
Okay, bye-bye
Bye
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate

Thanks
Okay
Your call is important to us
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller

Oh, I didn't, I didn't know that
So what do you uh
I think we're here
Yeah
Umm, no, I don't think so
Oh, well I thought that ah
Did that give you some clue
There's our star
So, so, what'd ya think
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw
I-I wasn't in that
So that's the girl you like
Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren
Oh, hi
Hey
Gosh, you look soo familiar
No, they-they weren't in the play
Why
Hey
Hey
Oh, is the play over
Where were you
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller
You must be going crazy
Are you okay
Fabulous
You know what you should do
By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review
Oh, classy
Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this
Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too
What
Why the Post
Oh, you didn't see the Post
You
You're talented and you're good looking
Oh, you're sweet and cute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
What
Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again
So you never went out with an actress before
Kate, do you even like me
Of course I do
How come you were with him
Why can't I just pick someone like you
Didn't you have that outfit on last night
You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see
Anyway, how did it go with Kate
You-you think
Did you like learn about her family
Two brothers, one died
Yes
She thought you were somebody else
What time is it
One
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch
All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore
You don't
I think you should stay away from him
Whoa
Umm
What is in the cup
Okay, it's coffee
Tell me it's ice coffee
It's-it's hot
When it stays light real late
Say, what's your favourite thing about summer
Probably the smell of freshly cut grass
My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly
Yeah, but you didn't
It's getting really old
I can't believe no one believes me
Hey
I'm soo glad I caught you, I couldn't find you before
A
They still want me for General Hospital
But, but wh-what about us
But I-I can't stay here just for you
Well, so, stay for the museums
I-I gotta go
Phoe-be
Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back
And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone
What
We could call it Chuck
Hey
Was it like a sneeze only better
Whoa
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole
Is it a pimple
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter
Ahhh
Good deal
This is Vince, Vince the people
Hi
Hey
Hey
Vince is a fireman
Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before
But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher
That's so unlike you
Hey
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign
Well what is it
I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples
Y'know, yours had a name
Pete's breaking up with me
And
People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you
Really
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple
Well that's not a third nipple
No
First of all, it's on your ass
I'm with Hamilton
If y'know what I mean
What ah, what happened to playing the field
Go with Vince
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive
Well sensitive is important, pick him
Yeah
Oh sure, go with the sissy
Y'know I have dinner plans
Yes, and the dimmer switch
For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV
God, that is the nicest kitchen
I know
But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon
Okay, I love you
I love you
I love you, love you
It's good news
Hello
I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it
For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing
She-she can't just rush into this
I have break up with Vince
Umm, is Vince here
I didn't know you guys actually used those
So, what's up
Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore
G-good deal
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests
You didn't break up with that fireman
He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me
What
We appear to have angered it
Ow
Oops
What was, what was that
Well it's gone
How's that
Ooh, nice
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about
Wow
There's one thing missing
What's that
You wanna what
It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that
What do you think
Get him, Vince
What
What
I mean we never said this was exclusive
Give yourself a break
Really
Huh
You haven't
You made him a candle light dinner in the park
Is there something you can do
Hey
How'd it go with Pete
Tell us
Yeah, could you scooch
What's wrong with me
What's the matter
How do you know
Well y'know, he's got access
Yeah
Y'know it's that feeling you get, y'know
Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes
All right, so, so you went to Pete's
What is it, Tim
No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name
He didn't ask me to marry him
Ohh
Well then definately don't take his name
He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy
Pete
What is it
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal
'They're are no rules
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking
And remember, there is no 'I' in team
Yeesh, what'd you do about it
Okay, can we please go eat
Oh, ah with who
Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again
Could we concentrate on my training
Promise me you'll be careful
I promise
Hey, are we still on for tonight
No boom-boom before big fight
Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now
How could you not tell me that she has hair
I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head
Why, does she have a bad personality
You're is favourite, you're his guy
We never get smacked
Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me
Yay
I love you, Pete
It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant 'You suck
And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets
What, look back
Well, you're not gonna get going are you
Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion
But
Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out
You didn't know that already
Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration
How long until Pete's fight
Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves
Ohh, that's too bad
No, I-I'm saying I liked her
We're going out again
No, I ah, I didn't do them
Oh, you forgot
Doug
Hmm
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself
kiss my ass
Oh
Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh
You said it was okay
You said she was bald
You owe me one bald girl
Don't you want him to be happy
Yes
What
Oh, we killed them all
Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine
You-you gotta give this up
Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid
No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous
Don't you
Oh, Bruiser is just
Really
No-o-o
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it
Y'know what that means
Oh
That is so cool
So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach
Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk
Yeah right
Why is that so funny
So I laughed
Oh good, you brought food
Hey
Yeah
What about ah, that bike messenger you hit
Hey
I can't have children
Yeah, I think she looks good
Ohh, thank you
Go, go, go
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage
Cookies are good, thanks
What
Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker
No, no
What are you crazy
Get away
Just once
Oh, come on
Hey
Hey
Oh, so, how are we doing
Bored and bored
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring
Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is
What
Really
Oh, yeah
Yeah
So, you're all bored
Ohh
Okay, all right
Okay
Woo-hooooo
It's just a shoe
I got you all right where I want you
Trying to get me drunk
I'm just making margaritas
What
You painting his toenails
Oh, come on
My boss let me off early, so I took the train
Oh
What are you guys doing
So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material
Huh
I saw you checking me out during the game last night
You didn't even take off your pants
Yeah, well, lucky for you
What
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm
Good morning
Hey
How did everybody sleep
Oh, great
Like a log
Us too
Hey, what happened to you
I just felt like hangin' out here and reading
We jumped off this pier and my suit came off
Ohh-ha-ha
It was so much easier when I used to shave my head
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald
Really
Ohh
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime
Really
Yeah
I mean you definitely should do that
Y'know what, I should do it
Now go shave that head
My namesake cancelled on me
What
Well, are any of those people here
No, no
You wanna touch it
Nooo, but it, but it's great
Hi
Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you
That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge
Hey
So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean
Ahh, no, I'm good
Okay, I'll see you in a bit
Wooo
Come on see, she doesn't look that bad
What the hell were you thinking
I don't know
You're the one who ended it, remember
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you
You still love me
Noo
You still love me
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me
What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together
What
I just, I feel, I-I just
What
I-I didn't want to make any noise
Then don't break in
I'm sorry
What are you doing here
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni
My Father is Chuck Magioni
I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together
Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship
You should really go in
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M
Okay, well g'night
Okey-dokey
That's that weird voice again
My head got all sunburned
Why
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie
Now
do stuff
Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood
Yeah, why am I telling you that
Oh, making it worse
So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened
I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off
Well, we were, we were very close
How close
Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple
I don't even know how that would work
I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old
Wait
I found a dried up seashores
Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it
It's over
Done
You just finished
And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice
So umm, does it
I'm sorry
Does it
Are you sure
Would you go out with me
Ennnh
It hurts
You want us to take you back to the house
It's like two miles
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole
Damn all the jellyfish
We've got to do something
Well, there's really only one thing you can do
What is it
You're gonna have to pee on it
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel
Hey
How was the beach
Nothing, I don't know
What happened
I'm gonna take a shower
Me too
This-this other lady is our birth Mom
I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note
So how have you been doing
You read the poem, right
Can you
I'm-I'm to depressed to talk
NO
What happened out there
I can back with nothing all over me
Come on
I was in too much pain
Okay, bye
Y'know
Yeah, I guess you're right
Or that have anything in common
I mean I like uh, pizza
I-I like pizza
Wait, I like umm, the Beetles
Oh my God, so do I
I knew it, wow
Cute or ugly
Ohh, so cute
But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you
I'm mad at me too
I'm kinda hungry
Me too
Oh-hooo, I missed you
I missed you too
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship
I didn't finish the whole letter
What
I fell asleep
I still have your letter
And it is a big deal
Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked
Will you stop
That ripped real nice
Y'know, turn and slide
I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed
I built this thing with my own hands
Yesss
Who's Chip
Why is he calling you
I'm reading your ad
Looks good, uh
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center
I love that thing
You want it
Oh no
Are you insane
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer
What do you do
I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living
Yeah, I actually don't know
Good, so do I
What
Nothing
She was a cat
Hey
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews
Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews
I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me
He was having sex with Amy Welch
How could that still bother you
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip
Look, you and I went to different high schools
Oh, really
I believe it
No you don't
Yes, I do
No you do - y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this
That's ah, that's pretty nice
Pretty nice
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe
Do we have to tell her
Yes, we have to tell her
He is right, isn't he
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong
You think
Hi
I just feel so, uhh
All right
I'm coming already
How ya doin'
So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch
Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man
What
It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin
Here, we are
You still have the Chipper
The what
A lipper from Chipper
So you still in touch with anyone from high school
How bout you
, Breadsly
Is that all
Ohh, how is he
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie
Isn't he an architect now
Are you all right
So - You got in voluntarily
Like you, I don't even know where you work
You know where I work
I do
The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time
You still work at the multiplex
I can get you free posters for your room
Do you still live with your parents
The chairs
Um-hmm
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school
That's so great
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want
Right
Right
Be supportive
I'm sorry
Okay
I don't know what to say
say you're sorry to her mom
We both forgive you
Come on, Mom, I'll take you home
Y'know, I've got an extra futon
We get all this rusty crap for free
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her
I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday
Wow, that must've been awkward
Well, not at first
You must end it, you must end it now
Okay, I promise, I'll end it
Doing great, the quiches are coming along
Blue nail polish
Yeah, I thought it was cute
Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her
Let me ask you a question
Hmm
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias
But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there
I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional
That's weird
What
Your nails
Then why are you laughing
It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars
Frozen lasagnas
Um-hmm
So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was
I don't get it
Ding
feel like we're breaking up
I'm sad
Thanks
What are you doing
I'm getting dressed
Why
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me
I wanna show you something
You are, you're gonna leave me like this
That's weird, she locked the door
Do you wanna see the list
How little
A couple of hours, I feel awful
You get back here right now
I can't
Why not
I'm in my boss's car
And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit
You promised you would break up with her
She just took it really, really well
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind
Never
You never come into this office again
Fine
You give me back my Walkman
I - never borrowed your Walkman
What are you gonna tell Joanna
What do you know about Van Gogh
He cut off his ear
And
What else you got in there
Where does the Pope live
No wait-wait, that's the joke answer
Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber
Hey
I can't believe I actually thought she could change
Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on
Now I know why
So you might as well just let me go
Foot rubs for a month
Freedom
I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'
Well ah, what can you swing
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts
No
I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning
You don't have it
I can make you this generation's Milton Berle
Well
They're not even touching the lasagna
Really
Oh, they love your casserole
And you
Wh-what's going on
So did you break up with Joanna
The volcano
And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation
What
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden
Yeah
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country
With such a sad history
Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me
New wallet, huh
What
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge
Third door on the left
Treeger
You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging
I didn't - I don't come in here a lot
Oh yeah, of course you don't
No
Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry
And he said really mean things that were only partly true
I think it's best that we just forget about it
So why don't you quit
Then they bring out Maria
Who is Maria
treat
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand
No
So you're strong enough to face her on your own
Hold on, I'll get the plunger
And tell him what
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry
Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968
I have actually not heard of that
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today
So do them for free
And it's against my oath as a masseuse
They make you take an oath
Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense
Then how do you explain the toe ring
You got us evicted
I mean you suck like you've never sucked before
One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs
I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts
You wanna quit
No
You mean the - Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion
Did you just bite me
You want me to kick you guys out instead
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live
You have pets
Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want
You'll do anything
Yeah-yeah, absolutely
Yeah, I've got something you can do
What, what is it
Can you be my dancing partner
His dancing partner
Hey
And that's funny, why
Oh, that's it
What are we gonna do
You're a genius
Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies
Hey
I bit him
Where
On the touchy
And that's not against your oath
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself
Like ahh, get really drunk
I'm sorry
No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back
What
You just did a little dancy thing
No I didn't
You did like a little hop
You are soo enjoying this
All right, it's like a sport, it's manly
All right, then show me some manly moves
Hello
Hi
We'd like to close our accounts
Is there some kind of problem
No-no
Hi, I'm Karen
That was amazing, was that really just an hour
really long hour world
What
But you know, I could always find another masseuse
Really
What
So you didn't leave the bank
And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account
What are you ever gonna use that for
Hey
What
You got fired
Oh my Gosh
It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before
Sweety

Okay, guys
Really, bitchin'
Wow, it was so - wow
I mean, really
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers
Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear
Bow or stern
Yeah
Oh
So I guess it's just uh, you and me then
Oh, okay
Yeah, I think it is
So what did you do today
and then it got canceled
Well, I could cut it
You do that
What-what 'cha doin'
Checking to see if it's even
'Kay

I just figured we hit a dog
Okay

This is bad
Horrible
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation
No-no-no, the kiss was good
Okay
No, but that's bad
Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened
What
Sound good
Can you really do that
If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try
I-I think we have too
Oh no, I'm not playing tonight
I sure did
I mean who needs a savings account
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had
Oh, I don't know

You were really, really great
Is that true
I won't play anymore
Very nice
I kissed Kathy
What
Is it
I think maybe, yeah
He loves you
And I thought it was a really good idea
I know, I remember that
Why do I have to tell him
Because you do
Yeah, I know
Hey
Samboucha Margarita
Is that a real thing
What's up
I like her a lot actually
You do
Yeah
She's not my girlfriend anymore
What
Yeah, she broke up with me
Oh uh, when
Are, are you okay
So you like her huh
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too
No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay
Yeah
'Cause you came to me first
So
I-I think I know who the other guy is
Who
I'm the other guy
Did you sleep with her
I just kissed her
That's even worse
How is that worse
But it's the same
But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her
I would never do that to you
I was totally over the line
The line is a dot to you
Yeah, like I could lose it
What
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time
So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office

When was the last time you saw her wear it
Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh
Hey
Even the TV
So uh, how long are you gonna punish him
Five years
You've sentenced him
With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open
Me

And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen
I was probably waiting for it to open
I gotta tell you, you look great now
You look great too
You're an excellent patient
Like a pirate
I moved back here a couple of months ago
No way

Sorry
What is the matter with you
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys
I swear, I won't say another word tonight
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously
Thank you

I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing
Oh, I totally agree

Oh, he sees her
Oh, he's catching up to her
Oh, they're hugging
He's taking her purse
I'm gonna go call the police
Very good
Because all I can see is this bitchin' van
Yeah, it's for our catering business
I think I know that girl
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though
No
No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry
dozens of people
Are you ready to party
Dude, we are sooo gonna party
And who is this guy
Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow
I'm gonna call after you
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore
Woooo
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van
Gandolf is like the party wizard
The hiring committee is meeting people all day and
That's great
Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job
Well, I, umm
I am so excited - I may vomit
Will you calm down, he's just a human guy
Really
It's not gonna be exactly like last time
All right, I'll see you guys
Whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Where are you gonna be around noon
What happened
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago
Chicago, is sooo lucky
I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that
I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me
It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time
I love working with designers
My first review is out
Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends
I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering
Do you need me to go with you
But are we sure we don't want the waterbed
Bye
It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's
Oh my God
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not
You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery
I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious
Come on, hand me them
Do you want me to quit
What
That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking
My drinking
Oh, I must've said that after you left
Exactly
ing binge
You are just a horrible person
I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department
Say more things like that
Effective tomorrow
I'd need an expense account
Done
I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf
It's Gandolf, and he's not coming
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'
I balanced my checkbook
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players
I can't believe he didn't come
We can still go out and party ourselves
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night
We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them
Well, we could do that
There's other stuff too
Come on
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
It's not like we don't know how to party
Let's go
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again
Yeah
Yeah
I finally get to run my own kitchen
Yeah
Yes
What are you saying
I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's
What
You don't really need me for the business
Yeah, all right
Okay
So, we're having fun, right
Yeah
I'm kinda beat
Actually, me too
Are you serious
Yeah
I'm exhausted
Yeah, me too
Does it have to be so loud
I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad
How sad are we
Yeah, I know
Yeah
Okay, I'm hearing
Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person
What
A bakery delivery person
I wa-I wa-I wa
No
No
Y'know what, let's do the catering business
Are you sure
Really
Thank you
Is Joanna in already
You haven't heard
Heard what
Joanna passed away last night
How
Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab
Oh, I cannot believe it
I didn't realize that she was so close
it happened
Hey
Hey
Where were you
How did you meet her
She was totally at my mercy
Were you so late because you were burring this woman
Umm, that paper's two weeks old
I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas
How come you never offered this before
Hey
What's wrong Mon
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me
But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life
Or, fire them
I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation
Then they would all know, who's boss
I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me
Wait, do you know how to waiter
Good enough to get fired
All right, you're hired
I'm free for her
Do you want to hear it
Nothing rhymes with your stupid name
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin
Oh yeah
Where are the seats
I've got like 20
So, will I like any of these guys
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh
Well, so what does he do
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division
Your company has a fine foods division
It's a big company, I don't - if you - I
You make food and robots
I got a problem with that
I'll give you a problem
You're gonna fire me
I-I got a date tonight
With who
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie
Yeah
Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all
Hey
Hey, man
What are you doing
Well, like father, like son
I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious
Ummmmmmmm, no
You don't tell the guy that
And it never hurts to wear tight trousers
I've got to fire you
What kinda things have you been saying
What
Bad dream
I gotta go, I've got another date
So, did you pick one yet
And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done
Thank you
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague
Prague
I absolutely did
You idiot
I'm sure you're right, but why
Now you scared him away
I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people
Really
You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right
Sure
Have you ever been with a woman
I don't speak English
You did a minute ago
Well, I don't know what to tell ya
You found that handle, did ya
That's not funny
You do
I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all
I'll give you a problem
No
You think it's funny now
Now that I see them, I win
What

You're really thinking about having sex with your brother
Huh
I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give
I mean pregnant
Yeah, what's your point
Well, the stuff I just mentioned
Yeah
We just want you to think it through
Like your mom
I am so jealous
there aren't you
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking
And the sex
No way is that the reason
Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that
fill his shoes
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor
The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love
Yeah
Yeah, you should
Yeah, you should, really
Go on
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period

It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica
Ooh, erotiery
Y'know

Well, how-how come
That's just the way it is
And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right
Hi
Come on, let's go to the balcony
Yes, yes, we had the sex

She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it
It's kind of an important one
All right, there you go
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy

Hey, why don't you
Are you serious
Uh-huh, yeah
Oh, thanks

Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it's just - that was my puppy

Now, how will they know if you're ready
Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick
Oh, I can uh, check that for ya

Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions
And the winner gets a hundred bucks

You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds

Say 200

You're doing it again
I'm just trying to spice it up
Stop spending my money
How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster
Oooohh that's interesting
Hey, no way, that rooster's family
Throw in the duck too
He doesn't make any noise
Well, he gets the other one all riled up
But if we win, we get your apartment

Nope, not knocked up yet

How did it go
We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little present
Oh
Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop
There's only one question
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean
No one forced you to raise the stakes
She forced me
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong
Well it stupid, unfair question
Don't blame the questions
You are ruining moving day for us
Will you stop calling it your apartment
But it is our apartment
They're gonna have a baby
I can't find garbage bags
What is it
But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die
What-what is it
Did you see the size of the closets
I get to have sex with the star of the play
People can hear you
Doesn't she
Hi
Hi
That is one good looking man
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat
Sooo, you've been doing this long
Dude
Is that an expensive blouse
Why
Oh my God, are you out of a job
Which is just a huge step down
Uh-huh
What are you doing
Hey
Hey
Hey
How was Kathy's play
That's a good idea for a business
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman
Yeah
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood
They're not a couple
Oh yeah
It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble
No
Yeah, I know but
Want some pancakes
You made pancakes
Oh yeah
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game
Oh yeah, who's playing
The players
Hi
What can I do for you Joshua
My wife, well my ex-wife
This suit and what turned out to be a skirt
There was some sexual chemistry between them
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there
y'know you
Hey you guys
Clearly, I'm having sex with him
There was no chemistry between you two
How can you not trust me
Well, you can understand, given how we started
I can't believe you're throwing that in my face
Josh
Uh, hello
Hi-e
Ooh, what do I smell
Please, have some
Oh, yumm
Yeah, it's just something I picked up
Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck
I've got porn for you too
Yeah, I don't need it
People are supposed to wanna hang out here
Honey, what is the big deal
They've suffered enough
If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here
What
Wait a minute
Come here
Are you sure
Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's
Hi
It's just so frustrating
Why don't you ask him out
That's such a turn-on
It doesn't seem desperate
Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on
He just got a divorce right
Hmm-mmm
Maybe, you just have to make the first move
Have you
That doesn't make me sound too good does it
I've never done that
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no
Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes
You think that will work
Did she call
No, sorry
All right, maybe I should call her
You don't need her, you don't need that
He's right, what she did was unforgivable
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong
How might you be wrong
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy
That's all you're basing this on
Geometry
What do you think
In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home
Great
All right, thank you so much for all your help
Sure
Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it
Oh well, you don't want to do that now
Ah, that's okay, thanks
That would be great
Good morning
Yeah
Okay, for next time, what do you say
Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket
So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down
What's ready
Oh my God
Great
I don't know, it looks the same
You used to have carpet
Oh yeah
I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit
Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later
Hey
How'd it go
Well, she wasn't sleeping with him
Oh good
She is now
What are you saying
This is all my fault really
How is your fault
A Joshua Bergen
Really
I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two
What's Phase Two
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club
How does going to a strip club help him better
Because there are naked ladies there
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women
There are naked ladies there too
Yeah
Also large
Okay, two larges coming right up
Great
Gloves
Right, sorry, I'll be right back
Uhh, actually y'know what, I kinda - I have to take off
Oh
But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight
Nothing
I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come
That would be great
What
For you and Emily, tonight, Die Fledermaus
Oh, right

My sweat pants
Hi

Hey, how-how's he doing
Uh-oh, what's the matter
What are you gonna do
I don't know sweetie
Help me
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening
Ugh
She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me
Hi
So
No
I think she's here
Thank goodness
So
I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day
Oh well, no I
I'll get her
Please hurry
Ohh
What
I think the baby kicked
Oh my God
They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it
What
" and he let her right in
You're wearing pants
I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers
30 in the morning
Ooh, let me talk to him
Oh-oh, my God
It's my phone and she's shhing me
What's he saying
He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont
Why do you care so much anyway
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back
You can't just go back a phase
You
No-no, it's uh, it's Heston
What
And uh, which-which room might that be
The one with "Heston" on it
Remember, a virgin for me please
And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy
Well, if you think it will help
How is she
How ya doin'
Who in the hell are you
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt
Oh no-no-no, you don't understand
Listen to me
Take your pants
So, we did okay at the strip club, right
Who, Josh
It's Joshua
What, he doesn't like Josh
No, I don't
All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on
Because we're girls
Yeah
And do you know what girls are really good at
Stripping
And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one
She was so spunky
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal
Oh, Chantal
Really
I am totally picturing you with all those women
That's-that's not Phase Three
Well, I'm there too
Like in a group
I think I just moved on to Phase Four
What is that
Come on, let me see that smile
I don't wanna
Please
I wanted to go to the strip club
Hey
Hey
Oh, hey
You were so right
Oh, hmm
Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy
Joshua
y'know
Yeah, I
I'm-I'm finally where you are
Oh, thank goodness
Go with your instincts, go with your instincts
Wait, now, what am I doing again
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that
What does this light switch do
Nothing
Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does
It flushes it
Isn't this amazing
How have you been
Oh well, I'm divorced
Bye
Bye
Bye
Bye
Bye
Bye
B-bye
And she's picked up like nine new ones
I mean, you hear such stories about New York
Hey, mate
We were playing rugby
What's ah, what's so funny about that
You don't even have rugby here
Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so
Cheers
Cheers
I just think that this is happening too soon
Not, Paris
When
Done
What's up
I think it might be raining
I'm man enough to play this sport
Did you
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not
Hey-hey, what's going on
Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow
Well, why are you doing this anyway
Oh
They don't look any bigger than me
So you look bigger to you from where you are
All right
I totally don't know what you're talking about
No
Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened
He asked you out
But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse
Electrical plans for the building
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport
One ticket to Yemen
No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket
Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards
That is one fun game
You have to stop
Those guys will grab anything
I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain
I like that
Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle
Huh
One swift kick and he'll back off
All right, bad ankle, got it
And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup
Okay
You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp
But-but, Liam's on my team
Hey
Look at this
I mean that switch is connected to something
And did you
Chatracus
Oh my God
Hello darling
Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor
If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket
You were amazing out there
Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I
Oh my God
You really enjoyed yourself didn't you
And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you
I think you've got concussion
Well, I-I guess I gotta go
Do you even know how long you're going to be gone
I officially give up
Yeah
Hi guys
Hey
Hey, what have you guys been up too
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum
Without me
But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed
Y'know
Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy
Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow
Y'know, they ruin it for everybody
I know
Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night
Oh
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce
Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans
What are you talking about
So I'm sorry, no party
Surprise
And I'm so surprised
Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny
What-what-what is so funny
I said, "Like what
Hi
Care for a cherry
Oh, no thanks
So why did you plan a party at the same time
Then what are you going to put on top of that
A little salami
Then umm, what goes on top of the salami
Pastrami
Up
You changed
I needed my lucky dress
And lucky means, more cleavage
How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him
I know how you can get him, take off your bra
What
There was a seen in Footloose
Flashdance
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl
She was a welder
Very sexy, and classy
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe
It's not Christmas
Or Spin the Bottle
You're leaving
Yes, we have something we have to get to
Uhh, yeah, I think I'm going to take-off too
You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned
I'll go
If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party
The baby just kicked
Ohh
It kicked once, it'll kick again
Because it's murder, cold blooded murder
Feel better now
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise
What
Well, I eat a lot of meat right
Yeah
Have you lost your mind
Hey
Hi
E
Gimme an 'M
M
Gimme an 'I
I
Gimme an 'L
L
Gimme a 'Y
All right, come on, let's go get your coat
Need uh, need a little hand there
No, I got this all under control
Why
Because I-I like you
You like me
But
Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you
Okay uh, however
But
I'm sorry, I, I just need a little time
Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go
I completely ruined your evening
Helps a little
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser
Yeah, have a seat
Well, maybe you didn't want it to end
What do you mean
You seem to really like her
Hey, you're right
Hey
Hey
You're a pathetic loser, right
Oh-ho, yeah
Oh my gosh, Joshua
All those things I said about not being ready
They're not true
No, they're-they're all true
Oh
But
You wanna go inside and have some coffee
Oooh, what you got there
Pastrami
Y'know what goes good with that
Hm-mm, corn beef
How about a little of that smoked turkey
Six months
Treeger's snaking the shower drain
What in the name of hell
Hey
I must've hit something on the remote
It was like finding money
We don't know what could make this go away
And no one touches the TV
And no one touches the air around the TV
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay
We still have porn
Hi
That's too heavy
Or a job where you don't have to carry a table
Hi
Hi
So uh, Emily just went to the airport
Why didn't you take her
And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so
And why do you care so much
You could get to live out my fantasy
You had fantasies about Emily
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything
Ahh
Do you love her
We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know
You love her
What-what is love really
Is that the heartbeat
That's it
Oh my God
No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats
You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one
Doctors are wrong all the time
Well, yeah
Actually, giving birth to three babies isn't that different from giving birth to one
Yes
Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies
Three babies
I finally got my band
Why would we be freaked
Right
Back to happy
No, Frank
Really
Yeah, refrigerator college
You can't give up on your dream
It has been in my head all day long
It's the theme from Good Will Humping
My new boyfriend Joshua
Yeah right
Yes
Hey
Hey
Did-did-did you tell her
I did
And well, what did she say
Thank you
What'd she say
" And she said, "Thank you
Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do
What do I do now
You play hard to get
She already lives in London
Then you go to Tokyo
You told her you love her, it's over
You're over
What
Hey
We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off
Hey
Hi
No
Are you sure
What's the second part of your plan
Uh, how-how was you flight
I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things
She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy
This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy
Well
Now you have to prove your love
You put your fist through the wall
But, it opened really hard
You have to go to London
What
Yeah, you have to go fight for her
I made fun of his accent
Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily
Really
Don't let her go without a fight
All right, I'm gonna do it
All right
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her
Hey
We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school
I'm telling it
Okay
A place where no one will ever get out alive
The name was my favourite part
Well, well I can up with it
That's not good
When is, when is the next flight out
It's Relaxicab, like taxicab
Are we in London
I'd really rather talk to him
Oh
Hey
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge
Nothing
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn
All right, ready
One
That's kinda nice
Yeah, that's kinda a relief
You wanna see if we still have it
FREE PORN
Yeah
Hey
That sounds great
What are you doing here
Twice
Hey, uh, you can ignore that
That's Carol with your son
Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you
Me too
Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week
Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there
Oh, well, I'll show you around
Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff - I'll go with you
Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so
Are you all right
Hi
Hey
It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes
I'm making him a very fancy meal
Um-hmm
Hey
Hey
Hey
So uh, Emily called last night
And now you're giving me the message
They're going horseback riding
God, Susan is so fun
My friend Susan is so great
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan
Things get a little playful - didn't you see Personal Best
No, but I'm gonna
Emily is straight
I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her
What a weird way to kick me when I'm down
I-I meant for the baby
Yeah, that guy really hurt us
It's a stupid, stupid non-name
So, farm birds, huh
Oh
Uhh
But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there
Your parents'
Yeah, they're out of town
What do you say
Hey
So umm, any word from Susan
She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily
What's too much fun
Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married
Oh my God, you are so paranoid
Am I
Yes
Am I
I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship
Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening
Maybe
This place is fabulous
This is the uh, downstairs living room
God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet
Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here
Oh, hi, darling
Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here
Oh, well we cut the trip short
France sucks
Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here
So you didn't even get to Italy
Hi you
Oh my God
Hi
Hello
A
Yes
There you go
So, have you kids eaten yet
Well, we were going to do that after - I mean umm, next
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat
Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house
We go eat
Yes
Dude, I am sorry about what I said
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name
It's not that bad
From now on, I have no first name
So, you're just Bing
I have no name
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off
See you later, Gene
Bye, Gene
Clint
So, you wore your nightie to dinner
Oh my God
So
They're being gay together
Emily's straight
Oh, wake up
Wow, Carol really messed you up
Huh
What
This totally makes sense
It does not
Paranoid city
Absolutely
This is so much fun
Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing
30 I am going down to the courthouse
You're actually going through with this
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too
Thanks
Okay
You wanna hug it out
Yay
Yay
Right now
Nice luggage
Hi
I missed you
I hate the fact that my room is so small
I'm so sorry
Okay
See, this is a great apartment
He does that
Uh, I don't know, whatever
I think it makes you look really dangerous
I-I love that guy
I love both of you
I wish I didn't have to go
One more day, seriously/
So, then you can stay as long as you want
Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here
Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on
You didn't
Ho
Excuse me
Your pants
So, how are the elves
How are the-the-the-the, y'know - You're clothes aren't funny
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats
Yeah
Yeah we do
All right
Just give us our apartment back
I didn't see that coming
Are you serious
We know what these are worth
Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid
You're meaner than I thought
What do you say
Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats
You're bachelor pad
Have you even had a girl up here
Good one
Season tickets, do you know what that means
Hey
Oh my God
We don't make enough fun of you already
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it
You do know that Wham broke up
So uh, how are you guys doing
Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear
Where is Emily
Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle
Man, didn't she like just get here
Yeah
Easy tiger
So what are you going to do
She should move here
What
I could ask her to live with me
Are you serious
I mean, I mean why not
But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her
I don't want to do that
Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua
Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon
It's the Knicks
Screw the Knicks
Whoa
I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more
Huh
And the Knicks rule all
Yeah, the Knicks rule all
Are you gonna do it
Done
Let me finish
Oh
I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all
Ooh, we could end up with nothing
Or you could end up with everything
Ooh, I like that
All right, so what do you say
No
Oh, just do it
Op, op, I'm convinced
Because, you're my best friend
I'm in
All right
Umm, ooh, ooh - oh, I have a game
Okay
Okay

We're winning
What do you say
Fine, let's do it
Oh, I have cards
Oh
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
Why are you screaming and hugging
Because we won our apartment back
Jack, queen, king, ace
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again
Yeah baby

Why
Hey
Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there
I know
My job
Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life - you come to England
Isn't - you don't think there's any way
What
Well, I didn't say it; I take it back
Why don't we
Why don't we what
Get married
You are mad
We've only known each other for six weeks
Doesn't it
My parents are going to be really mad
Is that yes
Yes
We're getting married
Oh my God
Yes
Ohh, it's a bit small
I thought that was going to be romantic as hell
Those were like the best seats ever
Y'know, kinda like a peace offering
We are switching back, right now
I don't know
What
I don't want to move again
We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer
You can't offer anything to us
Totally worth it
That was one good minute
Good night
Men are such idiots
Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true
Come on
Okay
Hey
Hey
Oh, are you pregnant too
Umm, no
When, when did - how, how did you
Oh, well, that's great
The sky is clear, the morning's here
The dark of night has disappeared
You have to go to a sleep clinic
You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic
They don't have those
Ohhh, yeah
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring
Hey, all right

Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man
I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut
Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay
You got it
He didn't say anything about no strippers
He just said, "No strippers
Oh, that is so sweet
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies
We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever
Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted
Hey listen man, about the stripper
Yeah
What's my last name
Are those yours
Yeah
So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party
So I guess umm, good night
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around
Yeah
The ring is gone
You're the worst best man ever
I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone
Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know
No we
Hormones
So how-how are things going
Oh
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that
Well, h-how is this like that
Hey
Hey
And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
Man, that's nice
Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in
On the stripper
They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders
Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her
Good
No, I-I think I just had a contraction
You what
I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out
The Bible
Where is it
Way to be cool, man
Yeah
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess
I still don't get how you know when it's false labour
Well, do you see any babies
How do you feel
You said you were sick of this
I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila
Some moms do that
You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better
Yeah, okay
I am pretty cool
Yeah
And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you
They are gonna love me
Oh
What
Ahh
What
Oh my God
The vet said it's a simple procedure
No, that's all right
I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down
No, you should
Now, don't argue with me
I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys
Really
What a baby
Hey
Are you ready yet
You got your passport
Woo-hoo
Yeah, cheerie-o
London baby
I was wrong
Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you
Oh, have a great wedding
Oh, I know
Why don't you come
What
It'll mean so much to me
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off
I can't
This is my wedding
Let's go
Do something
Well, up yours too
That's-that's time-out
Sorry
Come on
Chicken Kiev
Everything's gonna be all right
How's it gonna be all right
What
Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place
To what
Oh
What do you need
Oh, nothing
Anything
Okay, I have a wedgie
Okay, that is all you
So-so, what do you want for lunch
I guess we have to eat
He seemed so mad at me
Oh my - why didn't you tell me
We thought you knew
We
We talk about it all the time
Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me
Hey
Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day
Oh, I embarrass you
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you
You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them
Good choice
Hello
We don't have to
You found a place
This is when we're getting married
Or
Manhattan does not have enough stores
Well, I think I can help you get over him
You can
Um-hmm
And a small piece of chocolate
Really focus on his flaws
Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy
Okay
Okay
All right
So uh, now look at the picture
Ow
Okay, how do you feel now
And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day
Me too
Yeah
That's was
Oh my God
Hey
And was it your idea to postpone the wedding
Umm
She said that
Yeah
You're even dumber than I am
And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun
Sometimes we were
Okay
' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you
So, do you miss me
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun
So you're not homesick yet
No, I don't think so
All right, the seven of us miss you
Ooh, the pizza guy's here
You ordered pizza without me
Two pizzas
Okay, gotta go, talk to you later
You'll see
Oh God
Really, it's fine, whatever you want
It's perfect
Yeah
Do you remember where the duck food is
Forget that British chippy
Ohh - Do you think he will
The Waltham Residence
Yes, yes, do go on
Yay
Just keep smiling
Okay
Yeah
Hey
How could we have let this happen
Seven times
Well, y'know, we were away
In a foreign, romantic country
But, when we're back home, we don't do it
Only here
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs
I'll meet you there in two minutes
If you don't realize that, I can't help you
We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar
Forget it, that's off
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count
That's true
Oh, hi
Hi
Sorry, things aren't working out so well
It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right
Right
Look, I'm sorry
Oh, right
But, we have to change first
And why-why don't you go down and get us a table
Oh, yay
Great
Hi
Wow, you look
I got a girl out here
But, what if we're watching a movie in here
It's My Giant
Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this
All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser
Okay
Nope, not under here
You didn't find her
No, I've looked everywhere
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her
Yeah, I think you should keep looking
Yeah, for about 30 minutes
Well, it's getting late
Yeah, we're gonna go
No
You can forget about Emily, she's not with us
We've come for her things
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she
She doesn't want to see you ever again
But, I think you're absolutely delicious
Excuse me, I'm standing right here
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit
Can I ask you something
" Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing
Yes
I know
Hey
Hey
This pregnancy is throwing me all off
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck
Well, we certainly are alone
Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule
And I'm cute too
Okay
What are you, what are you doing here
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours
Oh
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh
Not yet
Pretty soon I guess
I'm sorry
You're a guy very much in love
Well, that's that
No, you know what, I think you should go
What
I think it would be really good for you
I could, yeah, I can do that
Yeah
No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go
Good
I know, why not
Right
Right
nah
Wait, what
See-see how I make jokes
Uh-huh
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend
Umm, yes, I can do that
Okay
Okay
Cool
Yeah
I forgot my jacket
Oh, wait-wait-wait
You tell them to wait
You look cute in bubbles
I've had a very long, hard day
Want some
No chicken, bye-bye then
Beans
He kept asking me about chicken
What
Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London
All right, anyway
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too
Uh, The Wheatsheaf
That uh
That was good beer
Ohh
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys
Did she, did she sound mad
Man, what is that
So you still hadn't heard from Emily
No, not since I lost her at the airport
You just did what you had to do
That's it
It's so good that you had a good time in Greece
And you know why, because I make very bad decisions
Oh that's not true
I'll do it
I mean it's my fault
I don't know
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we
What happened
Got myself a date tomorrow night
What took you so long
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London
That's not European
Umm, unless you wanna come inside
Yeah
Umm, okay, just hold on a second
Umm, hi
I-I have to ask her something
Oh, honey that's awful
I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while
But, it's not raining
Do you want to fall into the trap
You did not drop any socks
What the hell were you trying to do
People love to hear that
No
I really need to talk to you
Well, then talk
Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do
Yes
Because I bet you, you can't
But I
Please
All day
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group
Who's plan was that
Mine
It was my plan
Nooo, I said we needed a new plan
And, I came up with Atlantic City
Which, is the new plan
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour
I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute
What 'cha readin'
The paper
Yeah, what's it about
Events from around the globe
I mean, and you know how people can be wrong
Yeah
Okay
I mean, because the thing is
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily
I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that
Okay, let's go
Atlantic City
You're water broke
Do you know anything about women
No
Hi
Have you started having contractions
Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt
Well
Oh my God
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket
You-you're not wearing a jacket
What
Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head
The nurse said the doctor is wonderful
Yeah, he's head of the department
Oh dead God, save me
What
I'm having my first contraction
Oh no
Ooh, it's not bad
You okay
Ooh, something hurts
Ohh, that's so sweet
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie
That's what it sounded like
Where's Alice
Oh my
They're male nurses
Not in my head
What
Maybe they're with them
Male nurses
Yeah, I was bummed too
Hey
Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor
The Fonz
It's not that weird, is it
I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know
He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang
Oh no, I'm fully qualified to
Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones
Umm, well, what else could it be
It's kidney stones
Or
Oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky
Why
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday
I know, it is
Yeah
Can I tell you a little secret
I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies
Maybe I can, you don't know
Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children
This is, this is insane
Oh, just ask him
Me
Just, y'know, feel him out
I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids
Feeling a little better sweetie
I wish you hadn't seen me throw up
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet
Undo it
Mork froze Fonzie
Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right
Hey
Nice to meet you
Really, really
I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school
Oh
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow
I'll get somebody to cover my shift
No
Very good
Ohh, get these things out of me
I do too
Argh
Argh
Argh
Hi
She should be here by now
She's gonna make it on time
Yeah
All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31
Oh my God
Yeah, here we go
I see the head
Yes, it has a head
Come on
It's my son
We got a baby boy
Yes
Jr
You ready to push again
Leave me alone
Come on
Oh God, kindergarten flashback
Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes
We have our babies
Oh my God
So, I'll call you tomorrow
I am so bad at this
I think you're better than you think you are
I think you're my favorite
Which one do you have
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know
Yeah, umm, no honey
Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies
You're amazing
I know
So does it really hurt as bad as they say
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think
Why aren't you guys at the movie
Did he get in touch with Emily
No-no, vomit tux
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned
Ugh, PBS
What's wrong with PBS
No one ever wrote back
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs
Like-like you did with the babies
This is totally selfish
Talk about selfish
So
Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry
There are totally good deeds that are selfless
Well, may I ask for one example
That's because all people are selfish
Good-bye
About what
I-I really miss you
She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man
I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet
Hey
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship
Yes
That's great
In London
What
This will be your phone
But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls
No you answer it and take pledges
But I'm the host
You'll be answering the phones
Maybe all good deeds are selfish
I understand that would be difficult
I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that
You have to come here so we can work this out
All right
All right, did you just say all right
Now I'm the idiot
Again, very sorry
I love you
I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work
Yes
Ooh-ohh
Great
Why
But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife
Yeah
That's true
Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars
I think I'll pass
What good is that gonna do anybody
The bee is happy and I am definitely not
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man
You've been here all day
You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy
I would like to donate $200
So there, a selfless good deed
And you don't a little good about donating the money
I was saving up to buy a hamster
What, those things are like 10 bucks
Keep talking
GOD
Really
But, I just cleaned the bathroom
All right, let's show them how it's done
Ow
Y'know that wasn't part of it
For what
She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes
I'm waiting for a call from Emily
Yay
It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff
Like what
Y'know kinda what Emily wants
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help
I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help
Hi
Never done that before
But it's dark out
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around
Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time
Hey
I gotta talk to her
No, she's out shopping
Damn
What's going on
How is that even gonna work
Hi
Uh, hey
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it
Condoms
We may have to repopulate the Earth
What
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog
Please don't cry
It's Le Poo
What
Sorry
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore
We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do
We're switching rooms again
Why
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight
Geez, relax mom
What did you say
Hi
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants
Yeah
I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died
This is so hard
Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you
What are you doing
Damn Rollos
Hey, you're back
Hey
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust
Hey, you're back too
Okay, fine, $300
300 dollars
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room
I don't know what to do
You want my advice
Please
You're not gonna like it
That's okay
You got married to fast
That's not advice
Yeah, me either
Hi
Hey
I'm Kip
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together
Oh, that poor bastard
He got phased out
Ehh
Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room
Yes that was mine
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there
Come where
Hi
So is, is that better
I still don't get to see you
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding
I can't believe this is happening
I know
I am so sorry
Hi
So that weekend kinda sucked, huh
Yeah, it did
So, I guess this is over
What
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime
Why, exactly
I'm afraid so
Hey
No one knows
When
It happened in London
You can't
I mean, it's great, but
But y'know, it doesn't count
Count for what
I guess I'm done
Fun's over
If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something
Uh-huh
Okay
Sorry
Hey
Hey
Hello
Hey, what's that
You can't put up flyers in here
Everybody else does
You can't
What is that
Sleep on
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme
Can you blame her
Are you cool with that
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat
Woo-hoo
So you're really okay with this
I-I've been given the gift of time
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard
Yeah
Yeah, you fogged Danny
Who's Danny
Nice fella
Yeah
You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you
Yesss
Yeah
That guy is so rude
I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you
Well you did a little bit
Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry
I totally forgive you
Really
Hey
Hey
So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium
Oh my God, look at these pelts
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated
Rocks
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples
To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
Are you, are you crazy
What's going on
We all hate Emily
Yeah
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable
Oh, I know
Hi
So you like the short hair better
Yeti - I mean Danny
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell
Y'know
You don't even know me
Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog
Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here
Do you
I hate that
What
You can keep yelling if there's more
Okay
Are you still mad at us
Yep
Because we have an "I'm sorry" song
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you
Whatever you decide, whatever you do
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song
I really need you guys right now
And I'll make you favorite dinner
Where have you been
With Danny
How did that happen
That yeti is one smooth talker
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room
Why
I don't mind
JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US
Settle down
I haven't seen him in so long
Hi Emily
Hi
She's there
Oh yeah, there-there she is
You obviously can't keep away from her
Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me
You're right
Looks like he's smiling
Well, I guess that's it
Why, what happened
What happened
My marriage is over
What
That's a pig
Emily's cousin kicked me out
What
Didn't you sign a lease
Who needs a lease when it's family
We'll take care of ya
Yeah
You got it
Okay
What
Oh, Larry
Umm, do health inspectors work on commission
It's okay to laugh right
I'll check the kitchen floors
Yum-my
Larry
And where is your hat
Oh, I don't know about that
Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat
I-I'll call ya
Y'know since all the Emily stuff
Ohh, fun
Ohh, great
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it
And you're not gonna do that
Blew up in his face, didn't it
So-so there is no party
You follow me
Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you
Hey, all right
Why
Hey
What are you doing
Nothing
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while
Oh, hi Danny
Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night
We'll try to stop by
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy
You are
Remember I got that uh, gala
Yeah, what's the gala for
It's a uh, regatta gala
You-you sail
You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it
" Which puts me right back in the driver seat
So the ball is in his court
Let's have a game
No-no-no-no
Okay, so he's out of here
Hey
I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed
I don't know, clean places
What kind of a regatta gala starts at night
Thanks, see you at the party
Apartment listings
What about that circled one
Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio
Isn't it
Okay, let's go
Okay
I mean after all, we all are using it
Let's go quicker
Y'know so you can cook while in the tub
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks
It's a kitchen slash bathroom
Ooh, absolutely
How about Mama Lisettie's
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health
Yes that was a nice place
What are we gonna do
He's right there
Hey, Danny
Oh right, tonight was your party
Glad you could make it
I thought there wasn't a ball
I'm sorry
Frat bros
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend
I think I need a drink
Hey
Hey
Some problem with my application
You're kidding
You're kidding, no
We're-we're roomies
Yeah
Are you guys sure about this
Definitely
All right
All right
I think you killed us
I couldn't possibly eat another bite
I need something sweet
Does anyone wanna watch TV
Aw, forget it
We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for
I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having
Is it not there
Are you aware that you're still talking
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong
Hmm
See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything
It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever
Oh God, no
You are the king of bad Thanksgivings
I've got one that's worse
Yes, mine's worse
I don't have any past life memories
Oh, let's not tell this story
Oh, come on
Hey, it's not like it sounds
It's exactly like it sounds
Oh my God
Plus, it smells really bad in here
Is this supposed to be funny
No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary
Well, get it off now
It-it's stuck
" And it came out, "Squatternut buash
Yeah that's the same
That's my worse Thanksgiving
So which one was it
Which one
And of course, the Indians
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story
Chip and I broke up
Happy Thanksgiving
Y'know since I've been away at college
Did you like the macaroni and cheese
You should be a chef
Oh that's so great
Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week
Emotional Knapsack
Yeah
No, thank you
I don't even remember that
Well, I do
I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you
I am so, so sorry
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about
Yes, it was
Oh hi
Wow, love your new nose
That body
Dude
Dude
Well it didn't
What
Okay, that we may be able to do
How
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex
You're just gonna make him think that you are
Yeah
Then, you will definitely get him back
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him
Just act like everything around you turns you on
What do we got here
Severed toe, you just said it
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe
They're made of wicker
What is it
You brought a carrot
What
This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot
You brought a carrot
There's a toe in my kitchen
I'll go back and get it
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound
I need my toe
Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche
Oh, I'm not falling for that one
Because I called you fat
It was an accident
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot
What
I can't believe this
No I didn't
Yes, you did
No I didn't
You love me
Who's are they
Yeah, they're mine
What's wrong with you
Yeah
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier
Well, yeah actually
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships
Help us
What are you reading
That is so cool
Honey that sounds like fun
Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with
Okay
Okay - ooh, but are you going to have time to read it
Oh, I read that in high school
What's wrong buddy
Someone at work ate my sandwich
Well, what did the police say
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch
I learned that living on the street
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story
Anyone else
Well, honey that was pretty obvious
You didn't even read it
You in the blue shirt
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers
Would ya care to venture one
Would you care to venture one
Are you just repeating what I'm saying
Are you just repeating what I'm saying
All right, let's move on
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book
I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out
So you uh, still wondering
No, we just went out
We're so sorry
Yeah
Oh - I don't know
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet
May I have a word with you
Yeah, of course, Donald
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part
What
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist
What
I, I-I-I believe I ate that
You ate my sandwich
No
Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it
Hi
You didn't read this one either
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else
What
Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman
Don't be such a goodie-goodie
She's a cyborg
Isn't that like a robot
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right
I saw a psychiatrist at work today
Why
On account of my rage
Which I may say, right now, is out of control
He gave me a pill for it
A pill
And I thought was a good idea so, I took it
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work
And you're okay with that
That was not funny
Y'know, I thought it would be fun
No-no-no-no-no-no-no
Kinda
It's a disease
I am not a sex addict
That's the only way to explain all this stuff
Because you can also explain it with the truth
Well, what is the truth
Yeah, what's going on
let's see what everybody thinks of that
Oh no
You slept with my sister
How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on
Are you sure you're not just a sex addict
She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself
That makes sense
But sadly I could not be enticed
She's a woman
Oh, thanks
Yeah
Wait, you can't take the money out
I need change for the bus
This money is for the poor
I gotta take the bus
I can't believe I didn't get it
Wait a second, I could star in it
Or that
I can't do it
And plus, it'll give me something to do
You'd-you'd do that for me
Yeah
It's not
Oh, honey, I'm sorry
You meddled in our relationship
Hey, how do you spell suspicious
Why
You're driving me crazy with that
Okay, I'll stop
But at least you suck at a man's game now
I'm intrigued
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts
I had a really nice time tonight
Hi
I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up
No
Does it look like an ashtray
No
Nice Bucket
Hey
Oh-oh, yeah
In fact, I was undefeated
Uh, you weighted 200 pounds
Oh, you're kidding
Yeah, not since I got too strong for you
Too strong for me
Yeah
You wanna go
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball
Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed
I'm on sabbatical
And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk
Then you're an amazing friend of mine
I paid for those tickets
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time
That was unbelievable
I don't believe they're brother and sister
What
Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner
That chick can't handle my corner
I thought we said seven
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it
Why
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and
I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's
Do-do you, do you have brothers
But one of them has a very masculine energy
Are you close with them
No-no, they're not very nice people
Hey man
What is up
I am sorry
Hi, how are you doing Kelly
God, Tiffany, you smell so great
I'm not reading this
What's the matter
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know
All right, I'll take care of it
What
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister
That's a good point
Okay, great
Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight
What
So
Oh, good point
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99
But your divorce isn't even final yet
I am gonna make myself happy
Do you want us to leave the room, or
That my friends is my New Year's resolution
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar
Ohh
How come
I would love it would be great if one of those was true
I'm a great teacher
Who-who have you taught
Well, I taught me and I love me
I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would
Hey
I just asked that girl out
Nice
That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle
All right, see you later
Did you
Yes
Hi
I think they're very nice
What are you, what are you doing
It's my New Year's resolution
What, to blind my child
No
Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom
Yes, I did
I didn't touch a guitar
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid
Your other student, was you
Well, you can help me
Okay
Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom
I can't
Umm, do you see any - oh, Vaseline
Will that work
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there
Uhh, what color is it
I am putting out fires all over the place
I don't want to know
What are they
I'm starting to get kinda freaked out
Hey, can you turn the lights off
Oh my God
Oh my God
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry
Oh, be-because of the leather pants
Yeah
That really is something; that's really cool
Umm
Right
You want me to go over there now
Yeah
Do you know something
Do you know something
I might know something
I might know something too
What's the thing you know
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know
I can't tell you what I know
Well then I can't tell you what I know
AND YOU KNOW
Hey
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain
I can't believe you would say that
Is he romantic with her
I don't know
You don't know anything
Ohh, I know one thing
What
Oh
Sorry man
Did they teach you that in your anger management class
By the way, what are we celebrating
Hi, nice to meet you
No, sir
What was that
What
That noise you just made
Oh, that was my work laugh
All right, check me out
Everybody at work loved you last night
Hi
What's up
What is new with you
Uh, work's good
We can talk about anything
Umm
Let's talk about relationships
Okay, what's going on with you
No
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it
Really
I just wanna be alone right now
Oww
Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved
I think we should let them win the next game
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said
Let them win one
I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills
You're not even giving them a chance
They have racquets don't they
I was frustrated
It was my racquet
My brother does not stay out all night
Hey
Just, y'know out
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there
What were you doing
And then I just uh, just walked around for a while
I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want
I can't wait forever
No that's what I was thinking
Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say
You two will have very hairy children
He obviously lost his mind
We-we both have kids
Don't put ideas in his head
Big
What
He tells the most racist jokes
Okay
Judge
Judge rules, no violation
Hey
What
We
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter
Ohh, tough call
So how do you kids like your coffee
Thanks
Oh, you get used to it
What
What's the matter with you
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir
Excuse me
Really
But we're not ready to tell yet
To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better
Okay great
Yeah
In fact, he pays me to clean it
Okay
Okay
Thanks
Actually, I should get going
I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right
You did
Oh
What is wrong now
First my marriage falls apart and then
Sometimes I feel
I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun
Well yeah
GOD
Are you gonna be okay
I am now
Dude, we got to talk
Why would I be mad
Okay
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free
My turn
That was a half an hour
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages
Ahh
It's so good, isn't it
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it
Say good-bye to sore muscles
And you're gonna make them all disappear
I'll help you out
Hey
What
Is everything okay
Are you all right
Sorry
And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit
Ohh my God, I'm so sorry
A purse
It's a shoulder bag
Unisex
I had sex a couple days ago
U-N-I-sex
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in
Umm, yeah - no thanks
Umm, well, umm Grandma died
Didn't she die like five years ago
Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow
Okay, I know that I went to that all ready
No you didn't
Well, then who's been dead for five years
Look, are you coming to memorial service or not
Hey
Tribbiani
Your address book
I love this bag
What's the part, Anti-man
Hi sweetie
Thanks
Hello
Oh, umm, all right
But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter
Oh my God
What honey
What happened
That was my dad
Oh, did you catch him
Uh-huh
Why not
He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned
Could everyone please take their seats
I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma
Okay
That bag is gonna get you that part
Are you gonna tell him who you are
Well, at least you scared someone
Here, let me help you
Why are you doing that to me
What are you talking about
What
I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww
I can't believe you'd do that
What
Well, first it's not a purse
Okay, anytime
It's a man's bag
Umm, do you sell these bags
No-no-no, these babies sell themselves
That was great
Yeah but I didn't read anything
Okay, but now see you're crying
I'm crying about something that happened at work
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything
You don't know me at all
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world
I'm crying here
" They'd have to go to you
Absolutely
Umm, thank you for meeting with me
Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm
Okay
So, what did Francis leave me
Huh
Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C
What
So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please
But you-you-you came to see Lilly
She what
She's dead
Are you sure
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake
How long ago
17 years ago
Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father
That's a defense
Hey
Oh my God
Nooooo
I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt
And we're done with the chicken fried rice
If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place
I can't believe I never realized how great it is
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man
OH MY GOD
It's okay
THEY'RE DOING IT
I KNOW
YOU KNOW
What
Phone doing it
Come here
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that
I can't take any
Ugh
Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate
Okay
Hey
Hey
Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you
You can tell me anything
And the one person I want to the most
How did you get to be so cute
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny
Okay, now you're even cuter
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say
That's not possible
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her
She touched my bicep for crying out loud
This bicep
Wanna come see a movie with us
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry
Sure, I'll do it with ya
Oh
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it
No
That new mountain bike
No
Well what did you send
A basket of mini-muffins
Which one did you send
The small one
You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment
It was the best day
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie
Bye
Actually, I did
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me
She knows about us
Well I didn't tell them
I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell
Oh man
Unless
Look this must end now
So
Y'know what you should do
Or uh, or my underwear
Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline
He broke that
Well, he had gravity boots
Yeah, he broke those too
I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out
Are you kidding
They know you know
Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down
All right, I'm gonna go in
Shall we say, around seven
Yes
It'll totally freak her out
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do
How do you know
And my team always wins
Nervous
You
No, I want this to happen
You look good
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom
Really
Oh, do you not want to
She wants me to put lotion on her
Ooh
Ooh
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss
I can't have sex with ya
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet
And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me
What are you doing
Okay, I'm in love with her
Don't you think her brother should be Godfather
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps
Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you
I couldn't think of anything
Hi
Hi
So, are you ready to go
Hey, where are we going to lunch
You could fit her right in your little pocket
I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but
I brought you some house warming gifts
Aww
Salt, so your life always has flavor
Huh
Bread, so you never go hungry
Ohh
And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know
And thanks again
Hi
I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee
President
I came to talk to you about Howard
Howard
Oh that's nice
Or
I-I just moved in
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years
I-I mean I don't know Howard
Howard's the handy man
The party's gonna cost you way more than that
We're talking about my principles
Wh-wh-why
Well, because she loves you and because you love her
Am I right
I mean that makes, that makes everything different
It's not different at all, is it
Isn't this great
Are you okay
Casual
What-what are you doing
Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually
I knew you were going to do this
Well, you do want all that stuff, right
Oh and you know what I want
You have baby fever
This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap
Absolutely
By me
Oh, no
No-no
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right
What
Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in
You chipped in
That's always fun to be
Yeah, but you're making me look bad
Hey
big
Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters
Hiya
Huh
Aren't you gonna do something
Uhh
Are you gonna
Can't I please just go
So uh, what did you tell them about me
But somehow you came off as the bad guy
What
3-B
Oh yeah, aww
Don't you think it's time you went home
Yeah, leave
Now
I need to talk to you, it's urgent
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it
No
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now
Hey
She's right y'know
Yeah, but still, cheap shot
Well, you're not ready for that
No, I will not
You don't have to be so mean about it
That's not funny
Hey
Hey
Hey
Aww, you guys are so cute
I know
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you
What's with him
You say that to kids
It's not a magic couch
You picked a great couch
The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch
Yeah
y'know
Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out
You two
I am carrying a very heavy couch
Excuse me, ma'am
Yes
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree
Yeah I can, it worked real well
Who are you talking too
Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree
Sorry
Yeah
Good-good-good
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds
What is going on with you
Nothing
I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish
What was the dream about
That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me
It-it doesn't
No
Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness
So maybe-maybe that's it
That's interesting
You become friends after
Excuse me, is this your car
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th
Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there
I'm a whore
Who-who else is in vice up there
Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz
No, I don't think so
Yeah, big guy, kinda bald
I know
Yeah
Won't-won't that take longer
Oh, that's me
You certainly think a lot of yourself
Okay
All right, ready
Yeah
You think
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now
I can't believe that didn't work
I mean, you had a sketch
What about the closeness
Oh my God
I mean, you understand right
A fool
Maybe I came by and you weren't here
Me
Nice
You're-you're asking me out
I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me
Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer
Gary
Gary
Okay, so it's a date
Ohh, impressive
All right, I can't wait
That's what I'm telling you
Did you cut this couch in half
I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this
Good, you guys are all here
What's up
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow
Ohh, that's great
I know
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks
Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it
Yeah
You wanna work on your interview skills
O-okay
Hi
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet
Great stuff huh
Ugh
We've lost visual contact with the suspect
I know, but it's my job, sweethart
Okay, then maybe I can come too
Bye-bye
Oh God
What
Oh I just miss him so much
For just a week you guys are really close, huh
You just like can't keep your hands off each other
It's still going on
When did it end
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time
Oh hey, how'd the interview go
No
You kissed him
Well, I didn't know what else to do
I got a second interview
Yes
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job
Hi
It's really nice to see you again
How did you know that
Oh we can't, we already have plans
What are you doing
Will you excuse me for just a second
Ohh, so
I mean you had just moved in
Listen umm
That would be nice
That was amazing
You're the best
No, you're the best
No, you're the best
No, you're the best
Why
Zelner
Um-hmm
Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug
You know what I mean
You didn't
We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code
A public place
Haven't you
Come on, we can't let them win
really there anymore
You just freaked out about our relationship
Did not
You freaked out
Hi
Hi there
Hi
Ben is going to be in a TV commercial
We were just pushing Ben on the swings
What am I doing wrong
I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting
Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me
I say we throw a surprise party this weekend
Done
Okay, great so do you want to do it together
They're gonna do it together
That's my girlfriend
What, so I gotta shut it down now
I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad
There's a dad in the commercial
I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather
You're not his godfather
I'm in, they're gonna let me audition
That's great
That doesn't seem fair
It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit
Yeah, it is the best
Just say you wanna get some fresh air
Yeah, I can do that
I would love to
Oh good
Yeah, I wanna go to babe
I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food
What happened to the intimate dinner party
Okay
Thanks a lot, co-host
I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do
You're giving me cups
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant
How'd the audition go
Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection
Oh, sorry
I thought you didn't smoke
" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time
We get high
Oh, me too
How-how do you do this
I might actually get to play Ben's dad
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird
Yeah, it is
It's gonna be weird
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird
What's in 'em
I wanna talk to you about something
Thanks man
This-this is my career we're talking about here
Well, you just
What
You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad
At least I care about his feelings
And why wouldn't he get it
He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid
You just give him a spoon baby
I guess we'll just see
Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch
You're kid's name is Raymond
Kim totally took my opinions
You stink
Thanks
No, I'm-I'm serious
This is actually the smell of success
You smoked
I did not
You look happy and sick; you smoked
I had to do it for my career
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink
Tell me about it
Let's all quit
It does sound appealing
Oh, I never could do it
We could be like the Patch Sisters
Uh-oh
Is there a problem
Hmm, noodle soup
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup
Oh, what did I say
Hmm, noodle soup
Let's do it again
COME ON
Hey-hey-hey
Uh-oh, busted
I thought we were the patch sisters
What are we talking about
Surprise
My birthday's not for another month
That's the surprise
Surprise
This is so weird
I was in charge of cups
Hey
Hey
What you do mean
I think, sub-consciously
Thank you
So, did-did he get it
No
You can find her up on ten
Hey
Hey
How'd you get in there
Somebody got a haircut
I look like an 8-year-old boy
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting
Hey, where's the chicken
What the hell was that
What
That is all
But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him
I was not flirting
And on your anniversary, for shame
I was not and oh God, shh
Pizza Delivery Girl
Well
I think it's okay that we see other people
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place
Hm-mmm
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little
Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat
Big night
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't
The one that doesn't
I'm gonna go get ready
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you
I was saving them for something special
But I like it here
Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them
Where's the other one
She wants to wear them tonight
Tell her to wear her own earrings
These are her earrings
I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff
Why not
Big scene coming up
It's too scary
It's a diaper commercial
Hi
Hi
15
I happen to like 8-year-old boys
Thanks
You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys
You're welcome
You couldn't let me have her, could ya
What
This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there
It's uh, it's fine
Really
Really
Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women
And thank you, for that
Where was it
On your dresser
No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me
Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One
But I already gave them back to you
Do you like it
No, that would be, "Why are you being cute
Okay, I'm working on my flirting
Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women
Go on, teach me something about men and women
Somebody who wants to sleep with me
No way
It's true
Well that's pathetic
Again true
And this goes for all guys
Oh gosh, she's going to kill me
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault
Ohh that'd be great
Mon, can I talk to you for a sec
Yeah, what is it
I feel so terrible
You didn't do it on purpose
Your sunglasses
Caitlin
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas
They put that in
A lot of other gas smells
Oh the humanity
Meth-methane smells
Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go
More so than anything else
I-I-I found it interesting
Yeah
Oh, is there a problem
He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting
That was flirting
Yeah
The guy with the gas
And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you
Really
And she just gave you this
She thought you were cute
Well that I can believe
Why am I looking
That's right
These look the same
Definitely
Not as each other
Hi
You ready
Yeah
I'm the luckiest man in the world
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier
Let me see the earrings
Look-look-look
Hello
Hey
We saw and prevented crimes
You got to go on a ride along
Uh-huh
I want to go on a ride along
Me too
Okay
Me too
You
Yeah
Well, it's kinda dangerous
Well, I like danger
Yeah
Hey
I miss that dog
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead
Thanks
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one
Well, good thing you number all of them, huh
Photo 152 was a prototype
Ugh, everything's just falling apart
I also need some cash
What
Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya
Oh-ho, yeah
Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce
Yep
Your tax dollars
Did I say you could smell it
I can't smell your sandwich
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had
Yeah
What's up
Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila
So all we have is ice
See if he has ice
And no one talks like that
Yeah, no one talks like that
Cop
Hey, I'm more cop than you two
How do you figure that
I'm Gary's partner
I mean, we have to erase that
We can't do that
The Emily that wouldn't let him see you
But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message
Doesn't that give me the right to control him - help him
Your messages have been erased
What the hell is he doing
What is it
Is everything okay
What's going on
Uh, HELLO
All right, I guess we should go
We have to fix this
You erased the message
Yeah well unless we tell him
Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away
Yeah, but-but he didn't know that
Yeah, I didn't know that
We could use a guy like you
Who jumps at loud noises
Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood
Okay
All right
How come you took off
Whatever
Is something wrong
Y'know, from-from the walk
What picture
That's the bottom line
I was, I was trying to save my sandwich
From a bullet
I know it doesn't make much sense
I just went for it
You-you're like my brother
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing
I had an actual near death experience
What happened
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right
Yeah
Wow
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right
I guess, I guess I should call Emily
That was barely an experience
Y'know
Maybe this is about escaping stuff
Well, there you go
Maybe you didn't erase it
Yeah
It's not really a good story
And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something
I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys
He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us
I'm gonna get some tea
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh
What do you, what do you think
When are you gonna ask her
Okay
Really
Isn't it
Ohhhh
No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this
So, what are you gonna do
I'll just handle it - I'll ask you to talk to him
Why me
man
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island
Are you serious
You bought Shawn Cassidy
What-what is it
What the hell is that
It's a, it's a cat
Yes it is
Why is it inside out
But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat
How much did you pay for that
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal
How much
A thousand bucks
ON A CAT
It's not a cat
Now back to regularly scheduled programming
Uhh, the ball thing
Let's do it
What
Gary, I'm here to report a crime
Yeah
Man to uh, me
Okay
I just know it would make me happy
You mean scared
No, I mean happy
You wake up and oh yes, she's there
I can't wait
I just - I wanna be around her as much as I can
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary
So you know what I'm talking about, right
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game
I don't know
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work
2 hours, 27 minutes
Hey
Almost 3 hours without droppin' it
Oh yeah, I got a cat
I don't want a cat
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat
Yeah
Hi
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing
Yes I did, and I think you should do it
What
And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady
Here's the thing
Yeah
Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward
Uh-hmm
Yeah
I want you to move in with me
You guys have been doing this for four hours
What
He's a dropper
Oh yeah, that's right
I'm not a dropper
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat
Baking it didn't help, huh
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it
They won't take her back
Hey
We have great news
Yay
Congrats
I know, I'm so excited
So am I
I'm the most excited
Okay, I'll see you at the station later
Don't forget about the moving in
What happened
Why, do you write him a lot
Don't they
Anything in Brooklyn Heights
No, nothing
Oh really
Yeah
You-you checked today's Post
That's so sweet
I just - I want you to be happy
I wanna move in with you
It's a cat
What an unusual cat
That'll be $2,000
What
Okay, a thousand
I'm starving
I made this game what it is
Not fun anymore
Are you with me
Oh, thank God
Did you get your money back
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars
That would be great
We could have breakfast in bed
Why aren't you at Gary's
Oh yeah, that's over
What
Whatever the problem is, you can work it out
He shot a bird
Oh that is over
You guys wanna eat here
Can you believe how long we threw that ball around
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long
What's going on
It's this new guy and he's really good
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor
Oh God, here we go
You okay there man
I'm taking Ben to the park
Ohh, give him a kiss for me
All right, bye
Bye

Why are so mad at him
Okay
Well, it just seems that
What's the movie about
And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years
Yeah, I know that means buddy
I just have to be there by Tuesday
She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job
What's up
Hey, you've traveled a lot right
Yeah, I've been around
Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story
Problem solved
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe
Well, back to square one

Too dry

Dude you said, "No

'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone
Oh, you don't want me on the trip
I don't want you on the trip
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge
Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells
No
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike
No that made me feel precious
What are you doing here
Why
That game should not be played without my supervision
Not even close
I can't do this
Let's do it

Let's get to work
We've shut down
Why

How long
Hey, you're not rich are ya
Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star
Do you have a chair with your name on it
Please
Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie
Where is it
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner
So you're 5639
Who was that
Oh my God
Y'know the tall guy, moustache
So how was it
We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him
Really
I just don't want anything to spoil that
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year
I know
What
It's almost our anniversary
Huh
I got you a present
Wow
We can call it out plane-aversary
Do we have to
A-Nevadaversary
Yeah, I think we should see other people
But we can go, right
Yes
Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London
Hey
You wanna go

What'd you say
I said art lover
Is that supposed to be an insult
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked
Have a little alone time
Naked alone time
I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked
I love you
Can I give you a present now
Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back
May I come in
Uh, yeah, if you want too
Do you want me too
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened
I'm sorry
Thank you
Hi
Love your condoms my man
I thought I told you not to come
I knew you were not okay with that
Wow
Dawson
But that would've been so cool
After all this time, how can you not trust me
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it
Aww, there we go
I love Vegas
Ooh, so close
You can not ever see him again
I mean, you can't tell me what to do
That's so funny, because I think I just did
Fine with me
Happy Anniversary
This is obviously just a big misunderstanding
No it is not
I'm done
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too
I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times
But it was a first for the rest of my building
But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily
You totally get embarrassed
Is that so
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat
Really
A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today
Whoa
And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again
I have thought this through
Thanks
May I help you
My identical hand twin
What's an identical hand twin
Identical hands
Hey, are you unsupporting me again
Yeah

She loves you
Really
Hey, you wet my pants
Ugh

That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing
Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people
M-M-Mole people
No-no, a lurker
Kills you
They swoop in and steal your jackpot
Ohhh
Uh-hmm
How do you know about this
That's how she paid for all my dance - karate lessons
What
It won't come off
Hey-hey
I found my identical hand twin
Your what
This thing is a gold mine
That's not gonna make you any money
Not any more
There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this
You made up
Ohh, get a room
We have one
Yeah, the hand guy
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing
Nothing
I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life
Okay, what do I want now
Ah, a 6

All right, so what do you want to do now
I really miss downstairs
I finally won
How about we talk about this over dinner
Okay lady, you're out of here
I won't go back to that hell hole
We need something old
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve
That'll work
I don't think so
That's stealing
Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world
Stop it
Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table
One marriage please
Yep, we wanna get married
What are you doing
Does, does that freak you out
Whoa
Hey
Hey
Isn't that why you guys are here
Well that-yes
Why else would we be here
Did we miss it
This is insane
It's not like it's a real marriage
What
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas
Yeah
Why are we in bed together
Really
I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur
I laughed a lot
You want some of my breakfast
So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight
What about my cab
I don't know, it's such a long trip
This could be our chance to like renew our friendship
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance
Sure
Hi
Hey
Hey
They left me a message; they should be here any minute
I'm starving
And, how do I tell her without crushing her
Tell her she's not marriage material
What
Well you don't
Yes I do
Y'know, we were just talking about bacon
Hey
What
Yeah
We didn't get married
We-we-we - I remember being in a chapel
Oh my God
I - They would not let us get married when we were that drunk
No
Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free
We we're just gonna get an annulment
I don't think surgery's the answer here
Oh-oh, that's your thing
What
You're the guy who gets divorced
Oh yeah
So, what do you think we should do
I love you
Money please
Ready
I can't believe I actually rolled an eight
I guess
Last night I rolled a hard eight
That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper
All right
I don't
Hey
Hey, hubby
Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing
So, we'll just stay married
Yes, exactly
I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding
I-I am not gonna be that guy
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever
It's right next to it
Okay, put them down before you stink out the person next to you
You are asking me to be your wife
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane
Well you did pull his hair
He took my snack
I'm not getting into this again
This doesn't mean anything, does it
No
No
Do you like car games
Yeah, y'know the license plate game
I love the license plate game
Hey
I don't know if it's true
Oh b-b-but it is
There is the train station
Oh, okay
You can still sleep at night and stuff
I've been thinking about it since Kansas
Is it a kind of hot sandwich
Yes
Is it a meatball sub
You look like you're gonna be the
All the signs are telling us to do it
It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are
Me too
Do you
No
Then all your stuff would be here
What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying
There have been no signs for that
Me asking is kind of a sign
YES
Wait-wait-wait
Oh thanks
The key broke in the lock and I can't get in
I can't get out
This is not a sign
It's a very old key
It's an old key
Oh my God it's old
I love you
I love you
No
Hey
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment
Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie
Always
I didn't get the annulment
What are you doing
I'm not finished
Hey
Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment
Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie
Always

Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out
That's it
You're just gonna order me around all the time
Pretty much
No, why
Hi
Hey
Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times
Come here
Are ya
No
Hey
Hey
By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty
I'm so happy for you guys
Really
Who wouldn't want to date him
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her
Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy
I'm not your best friend
Hey-hey
Are you upset
I think there was a little misunderstanding before
Hey
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry
No more J-man and Channie's
You got married again
Yes
So that's your second marriage in two years
But, I-I do not love her
Oh, that's better then
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled
Have you considered therapy
I think just the annulment for today
There are a couple of forms to fill out
Hey
So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff
Okay
I love this plate
Something to remember me by
Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time
The end of an era, you might say
You're not blinking
I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era
Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you
What is the matter with you
I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all
It's-it's just a little hard to believe
What's hard to believe
But I
And it is going to happen
Really
I mean it's the end of an era
Oh no
Did you get the annulment
I couldn't
Annulments are more complicated than I
Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love
Would I do that if I loved her
Thank you
Oh we do, but not just yet
But it won't work out
Wow
Great
Uh-huh, what
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful
Oh
how about I move in with you
Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise
Who's Denise
My roommate
You have a roommate
How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about
Oh, that's true
We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place
Hey
Umm, she took it really well
You didn't tell her did you
No
Of course not, because you're in love with her
I-I just comforted her, as a friend
What do you mean, comforted her
It's nothing, I just gave her a hug
A classic sign of love, the hug
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair
Sure
Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much
The big-big ones
Let's discuss it before we reject it completely
Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no
So, that's it
The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques
It's the oldest game
I'm swamped right now
So uh, you interested
Okay, you go grab it
I saw it
I don't know what you're talking about
You love her again; you re-love her
You can live with me
What
What
Thank you
You're my hero
Hi
Really
Oh yes
We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room
We don't have to come up with this now
Oh good
Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here
Is that a problem
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together
Then I'll just bring them both over
See now-now you're taking them away from their home
Where is it gonna go
In the game room
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl
Hey
They-they're still moving in right
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room
Love is the best medicine
That's laughter
Why do you do it
I don't know
So I understand you're looking for a place
No-no, I'm staying put
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment
Why, where are you going
Right
Oh wow
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again
Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird
Because of our history
No
No
Not at all
We are
I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend
That's very funny
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness
Yeah, I'm not so worried
You still want to move in together right
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him
Come here, I want to show you something
Someone's killed Square Man
I want to show you something too
Okay
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge
Uh-hmm
Merge
I love that
Really
Fighting
I really think it's great they work things out
I've been back and forth
Back together
She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys
She finds you
Now, is that what you want
Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier
Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's
Hi
I can do that
Pillow
Fight
G
String
Okay umm, doggy
And
And it's a magnet
You're just, you're very sad
What
No-no, I bought those
Uh what, did he uh, say
They loved it
Well, who wouldn't
Yeah, Professor and Mrs
And Mrs
What
Hey
Hi
Hey
Oh, what's the matter
Well, you know that psychic I see
I can't believe she would say that too you
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you
But she also said one of them would be black
Why don't you open with a joke
It's a university, not a comedy club
Thank you
Some uh, some visual aides
Y'know what's a good visual aide
Please don't say naked chicks
Why not
I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks
Hey
Any good mail
I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed
They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year
Let me see that
Did that not come off
Aren't they
Hey
Hey
How'd the lecture go
That you're not funny or sexy
They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle
You've always been my agent
Really
Yeah
Oh well, no harm, no foul
I-I lost my health insurance
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now
What
What's wrong with you
But um, I don't think it's anything serious
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes
What the hell are you doing
I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out
Yeah, and not a very good one
Oh
Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing
Hey
Hey
Hey
Maybe you'll die
Sure, now I'm scared
'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday
Yeah, but I don't wanna die
Gimme 'em
They are mine
You stole them from me
You stole them from me
You just wanna each take one
Well
I mean they're probably not even listening
They're not listening too me
That's where you pick up the bag
You mean dying man
Okay, come on, do it one more time
Really
Hey
My reading was wrong, I'm not going die
How do you know
She must've read the cards wrong
Oh, I'm sorry
But are you sure you can do this
Can you cry for us this time
Okay
All right, from the top
Take 36 is up
Hey
Hey-hey-hey
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married
What
Nice car
I bet it's fast
Do uh, do you like leather seats
I could so easily freak out right now
Maybe you could be my roommate
Well there's an idea
Yeah
Wait, how long is Denise gone for
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th
Why did you do this
Look I told you
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping
Hey
Hey
That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there
Since you still have the keys
One guy gave me advice about my equity investments
You don't even have a car
And
And six others
Yeah, she tops out at 130
Wow
I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate
You got a place upstate
Sure
Well, I'll see you later
Okay, take it easy
That's my car
Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it
What-what are you doing
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up
But it's my car
I'm not coming back
Why not
I live upstate
This is so easy
That thing can put someone's eye out
And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep
Oh, I can still do that
What made you change your mind
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment
Fine, I'm mentally unstable
What
Uh yes, heroin and crack
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug
Well, you would know
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage
Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin
Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now
That won't be necessary
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think
Yeah
But you found the keys to his clothes
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes
Right
That is true
It's really poking me
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room
I think that's gum
I'm pretty sure it's gun
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche
This is totally your fault
You threatened the judge
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing
I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed
Oh my God
I took care of the babies all by myself
That makes up for everything
Okay
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one
Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married
I did those things because I was in love with you
Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession
What
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea
Did I, did I even treat
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special
And when is that due
First of the month
And that's every month
No, just the months you actually want to live here
This is how much we pay for electric
I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it
Well, how much do you think he needs
Whatever you want
And also, my birthday
It's not your birthday
Hey
Hey
Hey
So you guys have anything planned for the big last night
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing
We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes
Yeah, yeah, I know
Surprise
What
I have plans
You're plans were with us
I thought you said you were going to do nothing
Oh, but-but I can't do it
Because, because I've got Ben
Where-where is he
He's at a dinner party
Because I can see right into your apartment
Our last pizzas together as roommates
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese
What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money
It would be easier if you just give me your money
What do you say to $50
Okay, you're on
You remember when we got these
I'm gonna miss you so much
I don't think there's anything
Come on, there's gotta be something
Nope, she's perfect
I have one
Always, actually
Doesn't anyone feel better
I never get my messages
Or your mom
Sudden death, one goal, $1,000
You serious
Oh yes
Okay, get ready to owe me
Okay
I thought we'd say hi
Hey, uh, remember the roller blades
Ever
Still broken
Nah, not my game
A new game, it's fun
Well, what's it called
Cups
I don't know how to play Cups
Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun
A two and a five
50 dollars
A four and a nine
You're kidding right
I'm not talking to her
It's harder for her
Well, maybe you're right - She made fun of my phone pen
I'm unpacking
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left
Why should I have to leave
Because it's my apartment
Hey, how are you guys doing
Well, deep-deep-deep down
You win
Well, what did you have
Not 700 exactly
What
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it
What
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots
Oh yeah, good start Mon
She lets you borrow them
What else
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror
I-I do, do that
Hey
Wh-How did you lose at Cups
Nothin'
Oh man
I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups
You love it
You-you're trying to give me money again
I wanna make sure that you're okay
Okay
Okay
Thanks
Yeah
Bye Mon
Can I ask you a question
And now you want that money back
I made it up
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square
But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups
Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last
Ready
Yeah
Okay
Hi
please
leave
leave
Wait, I-I just said "leave
All right, so let's switch
OK, fine, fine, we can switch
Okay
Okay
Hi
Everybody
wait, how did you do that
What
Why don't you come with me
Really
It'll be like our first y'know roommate bonding thing
Okay, let's go running
Yeah and there's really cute guys there
Let's run towards them
OK
Please leave a message, thanks
You just took all the words
I didn't nail the boxes to the floor
She's-she's gonna be my new roommate
Hi
Yeah, she's gonna live with me
Janine
Janine Lecroix
Well, what a pretty last name
So, uh, wh-where ya from
So uh, wha-uh, what do you do
I'm a dancer
She-she's a dancer
Of course I did
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her
"When can you move in
Thank you for bringing her into our lives
Hey, look at all the boxes
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out
It-it'll be way too complicated
I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her
Oh God, yeah
No-no
Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed
I used to do that too
Tell her the truth
Yeah
Hey
Why would you do that
Ankle
Hey, hey, the place looks great
I'm gonna put everything back
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it
Hey Mon, how's it going
I really think I might kill someone tonight
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad
I think I may even try to get out of here early
What's your secret
That is completely untrue
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science
That's not specific to girls
This is great, this is great, what else, what else
Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny
So, what should you have done
Well, I-I should've told you the truth
So
People were looking at us like we were crazy
Why do you care
Because they're people
But people that you don't know and will never see again
Okay, is this lamp in the same place
Naked
Bye
Thank God
Dude, what'd you have
Uh, don't you mean "for whom
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one
ba dum bum cheshhh
Is there something wrong
So the question is, what do we do
Oh
Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on
I'm OK
What
What
Hey
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great
Is it okay for me to come in now
Uh-huh
Do you want me to be afraid of you
Really
Of course
So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer
and live forever as a machine
You and I, we're interfacing
Yeah, I gotta go
Why haven't you told them
But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't
Why wouldn't they be happy
I'm sorry
Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me
I'm sorry
You really think that'll work
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment
What's up
I thought you guys might like to come
Hey
Hey
No, sweetie, I-I trust you
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert
Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done
Hey
Hey
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon
And the place looks so nice
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody
Happy Thanksgiving
Happy Thanksgiving
Well, this has been great
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl
Some would say she's attractive, yes
And who else is going to be there
Uh, some of her friends, yeah
Hello everybody
Hi
We just won't tell her she messed up
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear
Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you
Why
I-I didn't think it would matter
What about all that 'friends forever' stuff
Now who should I say it was
You-you don't still do it or anything
Truth-Day
The holiday season is upon us, hm
Yeah
You look nice today
What
It sure is
So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant
Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers
It tastes like feet
I like it
Are you kidding
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today
You've had your chance
I'm sorry
It was you
Again
What happened son
I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad
It's still in the bathroom
I remember when people used to use big lights
Hey
Did someone get her drunk again or
It's about being with the people that you love
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me
And that was like 4000 years ago
I can see why that's hard to resist
I like her so much
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way
I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right
Hey guys
It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve
Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve
Yeah, that's what I said
I'm gonna be one of the party people
I would love to spend New Year's with you
Yeah, not a lot of people know that
Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too
Are you serious
What, what are you laughing at
Bye
Bye Janine
Did she just ask me out on a date
I don't think so
Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing
It was a dry day
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve
Oh my God
The important thing to remember  stay cool
Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it
'Scuse us
Any questions
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet
That's terrible
No-no, we do it every year
Oh well, that makes it not terrible
But we have to
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I live here too
Well then, you should look with us
Why
If I help, we can find 'em faster
Ooh ooh, we have a live one
She may be onto us
Okay, here comes another camera
They've been taping those people up there all day
Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there
We learned how to dance
You're a good dancer
Really
Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little
What do you mean
That's better
There were in the guest room closet behind some coats
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap
Those are my gifts, I got them for you
That's a great gift
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz
Ha
We know
We should go dance by him
To think I almost brought my wife to this
No I don't think so
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow
Look, are you dating this girl you came with
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know
Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform
What
Was it really that good
Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice
So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner
What's going on over here
Get out of here
We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment
Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you
No
Destiny
Three, Two, One
Cut
Look who I found
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter
Hey, this is hollow
No, don't look directly at them
What
Alright, no, we could look at them
Here
Oh great
And the big one's for me
Ooh, let's open them
Okay
Hee hee
Wait, we can't do this
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine
So please, please, can we just, can we put them back
Will you get us better gifts
Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier
That's what you got me
In the moment
In the moment, yeah
So do ya wanna kiss again
Can you wait
No
Me neither
Hey
Hey
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine
Honey, we have been through this before
Don't do this to yourself
You serious
That's great
Really
Yeah well, we'll see
You kissed her
Oh we kissed it up real nice
So you kissed her, so what happened after that
I came over here to tell you guys
She-she kisses better than my mom cooks
I am so glad you said cooks
You got it from Pottery Barn
They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed
She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it
I made that for her
You made pottery
Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs
Look at us, we're a couple of couples
I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant
I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about
Oh that would be great
See ya tomorrow
How are we gonna get out of that one
What
I don't know, they're just a little blah
'Cause that would kinda be a problem
Okay
Hey
Guess
Umm, a flea market
Ohh, yes
Ooh, you can almost smell the opium
Almost
How much was it
It was only 500 bucks
A dollar
So it was like one and fifty dollars
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing
Yeah
Well, what period is it from
Y'know
Like y'know where it was from or
We're here
You like it
Oh no
I got it at Pottery Barn
I told her ours was an original
Why did you do that
Because she hates Pottery Barn
Oh, I forgot they made sheets
It's not like she hates you
Hey
You wanna know where I got it
Sure
He got it a flea market
Hey
Hi
Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight
What happened to Janine
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick
No-no, she really is sick
Then why-why is she going to a play
I'm so sorry
She was lying to our faces
We could not have been nicer to her
And I am not blah, I am a hoot
Plus, she's really sick
She'll come around I promise
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner
Ohh
My apothecary table
Oh yes
Well this doesn't even smell like opium
Hey
So uh, what are you guys doing
Y'know, blah-blah-blah
I mean you owe me
We owe you
I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here
I went a little crazy
It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times
Oh honey he doesn't need my help
I do want to
Oh, she does want to
She does want to
There's the coffee table they stole from us
Let's go
Oh my God
Come on don't be mad
I have to buy that lamp
Didn't everybody have a great time
I guess I was just nervous or something
That's totally understandable
Don't worry about it
So we can go out again
Oh yeah
Absolutely
Oh good
Eh, wasn't that fun
These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way
What did I tell you about the hall
Me too
Okay
Did you hear that
Hey
How ya doin'
Hey so, did uh, did she move out
Pretty much, yeah
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that
Well, when it's not right, you know it
You okay
I'll be all right
Y'know what would cheer you up
What
They printed it
I didn't know Playboy prints jokes
It's not just about the pictures
It was also funny when I made it up
What
I made that joke up
I did
No
Seriously
You can call them, they'll tell you
It's my joke
It's my joke
Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
Oh, was she hot
Wh-wh-what are you doing
Yeah
I mean, that's got to come in handy
You forget how many great songs Heart had
Yeah
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there
Well, if you want, you can work here
What
Flexible hours
And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes
That's a good idea
Yeah
kinda high maintenance - Okay let's go to lunch
Y'know, you can just walk all over her
I cannot believe her
Where do you wanna go eat
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place
We're not going there
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool
No
I'd love an ice water
No
Hey, waiter
What didn't you tell us you work here
It's supposed to go in the other direction
You're wearing it like a cape
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird
Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it
We would like to talk to you for a second
Okay
Hah
That true, I am flaky
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky
Yeah, totally
Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover
Good for you guys
I am not high maintenance
I am not a pushover
You did
I just got an audition
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed
'I'm sorry, that seat's saved
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but
Okay, I'll see you in an hour
'I'm sorry, that seat is taken
Oh, excuse me
But, you believed me, huh
I believed you were saving this seat for someone
So, you'd hire me, right
For what
The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour
What
It's my joke
It's my joke
Yeah
Yeah
Hey Mon
You have to help us decide whose joke this is
Why do I have to decide
Because you're the only one that can be fair
Yeah
You're my boyfriend
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas
Can I finish my story
Do you want me to pick you
I'm Doctor Monkey
I'm not arguing with that
It's your joke
There you are
That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard
I've heard better
You are on my list
Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go
I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so
That is a bad audition
That's not, that's not right
Okay

He can have his job back
Hey
No way

Never mind, I got it
Then I'm gonna cut you off
What did he say
Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off
Okay, I bought a boat
You bought a boat
Of course, yeah
I don't know how to thank you guys
What
For all the free food you gave away
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it
We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest
So who made her queen of the world
Yeah, we went shopping
Wow, you guys are terrible
Sorry Jill

He works at the university
I mean he's nice
Yeah
Me, not so much
Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish
Are-are you saying he's a geek
You think so too
Fine, then let's just say he's not my type
You would be lucky to be with him
Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant
You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me
Yeah but, he's not your type
What
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep
You're paying for that
No-no it's her birthday
You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today
But it really
Hi
Did you tell your sister to ask me out
Well yeah
Really
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not
Oh so-so not really never
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way
I really need your help
No-no-no-no-no
Fine, I'll rub it on myself
So you're just, kinda rubbing it on yourself
Yeah
It's nice
Not now, I'm sick
Oh come on you big faker
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people
Well that was before all the vaporizing action
Well, I-I don't like it
Really
It's kinda slutty
It's yours
Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here
What are you guys doing
How weird is that
Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes
Oh don't even ask
That was like 5 years ago
There you are
Yeah, it was fun
So uh, so did you guys hit it off
I guess so
Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes
And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe
She asked-asked you out again
yeah
You want me to call her right now
What is going on with you
I might be teaching another class this semester
I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time
I'm not macho
I don't know what I was thinking
I'm not a crying kind of guy
Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy
All the other puppies pick on me
That's me with the janitor Martin
Where were your parents
Poor thing
So that story doesn't make you cry
Okay
Excuse me
I've seen all her movies
Hey
It's not random, it's Bob
Because I asked him to
You asked him too
Hm-mmm
No
There's a million other guys out there, you just
You have no right to tell me what to do
I am telling you what not to do
Why are you so jealous of me
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob
Who
Princess Caroline
You're jealous of Princess Caroline
Sort of
The Vampire Layer
Where did you get that
I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn
Yes, but you are dead inside
All right well, I'd better take that back
Wh-what, why
Yeah you're right, we can't - we shouldn't watch this
Probably just the first half
Well, I'm not gonna watch it
Ah, I thought I'd find you here, Nasforatool
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places
What is that on her ankle
There's no back to this couch
You hate this kind of stuff
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest
Yeah
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then
Aww, I love you so
What is wrong with you
What
Now, I left you a note from the beyond
So you didn't mean any of that
Okay, umm
But you know what might really cheer me up
What
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides
Really
And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand
Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes
I can't find her anywhere
We're still rolling
And-and you're using my name
You're - you mean her
Y'know, twin stuff is always a real big seller

Slides are almost ready
Alcohol

What happened
Umm, she kissed me
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay
See look at us, right now, not kissing
Bye-bye-e
Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce
Oh my God
Which time
I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch
What
Well why didn't you take the job
Right
Me too
You should stop bye and say hi
Ohh, I would love too
Oh-oh, she'd be so excited
Boring huh
Thanks
Hey
What's the matter
They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny
I got to get back to the hospital
Was his question what's more boring than him
Do uh, do you need me to give you some money
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride
Really
See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff
Let's do that
I could use the money; it could give me time to write
Welcome aboard
Okay
Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break
Guess what
Hey Mon
Hey
Hi
Well, it's always nice to meet the fans

Still going through that dry spell with Carol
Yeah
How long has it been since you had sex
Well, last weekend
Oh that's not so bad

That is

Maybe you need to spice things up a little
What-what do you mean
Oh
Y'know, dirty talk, ménage à trois, toys
Wow
You could be the pirate; she could be the wench
Hey
That's a line from the show too

Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break
Yeah, I heard it
Y'know, give him my flower
Honey, you've waited long enough
You are right
I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband
Put that cigarette out
The smoke is coming out of me
Oh, give it to me
I got it
Did he yell
Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better
You have got to let her go
With me
Oh, me too
Well, I-I think Ben's asleep
Hey
Hey, how's it going
I hate herbal tea
She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she
No, the doctors say it may kill her
People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31
But if I didn't work there, what else would I do
Well, you used to like playing the guitar
Smart like your brother
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it
And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you
They have parasites
Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac
So oysters, huh
Something we can eat, with our hands
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases
It's sensual
We're really gonna do this, huh
Thank you so much for coming
I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger
That's not funny
Okay
What was tonight
I've Had Sex Four Times
I've had sex way more times
How many
Nine
I was just waiting for the perfect guy
You really think that Roger is the perfect guy
He's not a horrible guy
You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you
I was kidding
Let me ask you a question
Yeah
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are
I can't, I can't feel my hands

Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me
And I want you to have it
No-no-no
And that's what this ring stands for
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother
Look, do you want the ring or not

Well, welcome back
Are you okay

We're sorry
Who are these men
Good day for married people huh
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you
I guess women aren't that great either
Roger got beeped again
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him
Really
There was just one woman, wasn't there
No, there were two
Including me
Hey, remember when I had a monkey
Yeah
Y'know what's even more generous than that
Maybe you'll get that job
Yeah
What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working
Hi
Hey
Hey, what have you guys been up to
We went to a self-defense class today
Now, we can kick anybody's ass
Yeah
Isn't that a kind of sushi
No, it's a concept
It's freshwater eel
All right, maybe it means that too
I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now
No
Aw, I love that
You guys
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut
What is that
Nothing
Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts
Oh, yeah
Do we have to make the entire thing
Why, did you - you forget to make yours
It's a twins study
But it's $2,000
Sorry
Ohh, you're a freak
What
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her
You uh, ready to exchange gifts
Okay, you go first
Now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it
Okay
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs
Thank you so much
Okay
Okay, you ready to open yours
Yeah
It's a sock bunny
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny
Not really
See that's what this is about
You have done enough
I wanna wake up early and go get it for you
Oop, your cake is ready
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl
Who the hell is Carl
Pat Sajak
Yep
Alex Trebek
Oh, of course
Chuck Woolery
Say it
Say we are unagi
It's something you have
Say it
Now remember, what is not gonna be
Another Minute Maid fiasco
And what are you not gonna do
That's right, $2,000
But, you're not identical twins
Oh my good God
3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs
You have to stop this now
For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me
It's a great class
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them
What would you do next
Me the attacker
Yes that's right
Why
I tired attacking two women, did not work
What
In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them
Please-please, please
DANGER
Why is he jumping on those women
We should help him
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh
Who wrote it
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams
Because I'm a teacher and she's a student
Oh, is that against the rules
No, but it is frowned upon
I see
Besides, there's a big age difference
Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director
She was in my Movement class
You gotta get me an audition
You owe me three thousand, four hundred
Will you make the call or what
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try
Can you remember Thursday
You just thought of that in there
How bad was it
Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation
But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore
I'm kidding
Oh well, it's not so bad
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms
Oh, how bad is it
Fireman
Well uh, do either of you smoke
But yeah, I could use one right now
Burn incense
Hi
Ah-ha
So, now you're going on a date with this girl
You gotta, you got to put in some time
It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend
No, we only went out once
You dated her
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie
" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first
The nerve huh
Yeah
It sure didn't look this way when I lived here
It was an accident
Oh, you have been through so much
You never even noticed me
You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson
Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt
So umm, did you have a nickname for me
No
What was it
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty
Ohh that's so sweet
So did you sleep well last night
I did
What
Gum
Well, we determined the cause of the fire
My candle
It's looks like a curling iron
I don't use a curling iron
Straight
It could've been a hair straightener
I can smell it a little, bake the pie
Okay
So it's okay to date a student
You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents
Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday
I couldn't do it
You couldn't do it
We're going to dinner tonight
You're going out with her again
Going out with who
You didn't even know her
Woo-hoo-hoo
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going
Because you-you should you-you-you should stay
Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better
No-no - Really
Ohh, I'm sorry
Well maybe there is one thing you can do
How's it goin'
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes
I made cookies
I'm still full from your homemade potato chips
Sorry
Don't worry about it
I've never lived like this before
You wanna go get a drink
Uhh, I can't
Oh, you have some studying to do
What are you doing
Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you
Do you not want to be seen with me
Are-are they gone
Hi
Aren't you in my Popular Culture class
And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore
You are so fired
What
It's against the rules
I'm fine here
Really
I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other
It kinda made me like you even more
It's forbidden
Wow
What
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot
Really
Yeah
Hey
Hey
So
So
Roomie

No really, they're OK
You gonna slice them up real nice
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne
Ohhhhhh

You ate my sandwich
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes
Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit
I mean how crazy would that be
You mean you didn't get it from this
Thanks
This part could've turned my whole career around
I'm sorry, I really messed up
I have my machine
The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap
Did you sleep with her
I just kissed her
That's even worse
How is that worse
But it's the same
I was totally over the line
You've made some errors in judgment too
So--You got in voluntarily
And what did you bring
took advantage of me
What
I've been going to the guy for 12 years
What
Cupping
Isn't that how they measure pants
Do you think he'll ever forgive me
I-I kinda have
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know
It took two people to break up this relationship
I didn't finish the whole letter
What
You had no right to go out with him
That is the most ridiculous
You sold me out
I did not sell you out
Ow
I know
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop
Fine
Fine
You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own
Oh my God
Hey
Please tell me you got the message
It's 6 o'clock
I-I-I don't know what to say
Oh, well I'm uh
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean
I did not mean to make you feel bad
Oh, we could do this all day
Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be
I'm gonna hug ya
You hug me
Hey, do we do this too much
Yeah, get off me
My hearing would be impaired
And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac
Yeah
So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick
Why have I not been preparing
And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on
Be-because the last one was such a big seller
Hey
Hey
I want to see what he wants first
You're not Elizabeth's dad
We'll be here
Thanks
Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you
It-it's great to meet you Paul
Stevens
Eh-wh - Excuse me
Okay
Daddy
I'm Irish
Bing
And he's a great brother
I had a sister
Ohh
When does Liz's father get here
I'm already here
No, you said the baby creeps you out
No, the little girl creeps me out
You said the baby
Why would the baby creep me out
This is going in your book
This stuff is great
Just call me Paul
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter
Well, we were very young when we had her
Hey
Hey
Hey
How was your first day
Except I did get a little attitude from the robot
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants
Ohh
Wow
E
E
What-what-what the - how da-how did-what the-how did-what
So I kissed the guy
It's-it's, it's weird
Wh - You dated my sister
That was different
Why
How is that important
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here
I'm writing about other people
Who
Marcia and Chester
Hmm
Oh
Oh-oh
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
I know what you mean; I do that too
I beg your pardon
You're back
You two were married
We said seven
Oh my good God
Ugh
I know what time you said
What
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book
Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie
That's right
I can't believe I'm going to lose this job
Is there anything I can do
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah
Yeah
I wish I could talk to her
What are you in love with her or something
Anyone
So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly
Are you yelling at me
God no
That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either
Then we agree
E
Hey
Hi
What's the matter
It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us
I'll give up my ticket
Me too
Yeah
Hi
But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town
Oh that's great
Yeah
I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make
What
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right
That okay, that's great
All right look, I-I realize it upsets you
I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired
Eek
So I'm back
Oh well, it's not on TV yet
Oh, I love museums
Umm
Soakin' up all the culture
Yeah
Where do you want to start
Ooh, the gift shop
Yeah
Hey, and then lunch
What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay
Why
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down
I'm gonna do it too
Me too
Who would, who would you marry
It don't go up on the wall
What - But you saw the show
Yes, it was very offensive to my people
Dry cleaners
It showed them as terrorists and villains
You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there
That-that-that's offensive to Russians
I've never seen it
This place is really beautiful
This used to be my Grandma's
What's wrong
Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father
Well, whatever works for ya
No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before
Besides, it's kinda fun hiding
I'll just run to the store and get some
I'll get it
Do you know where the store is
No
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle
Okay
Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there
It's so secluded up here
Did you see a little mouse
I think I-I - would you - actually, would you go check on that
Honey, we don't have any bears here
What are you doing here
I came with Paul
Yeah, I recognize the ankles
I need ice
Okay
Ohh, thank you
Uh, you guys
How did you know we were here
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something
Why are you yelling
Can I help you
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall
He's not here right now
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night
Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible
What do you need from the car
And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere
Okay, maybe ask this guy
You, get out of my shop
Well, what did he do
Well, we should go
You and I are going to have to have a little talk
Daddy
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain
Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't
Okay
Totally
So did Heldi show you the place
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go
I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet
Hey
Oh all right
Yeah, coffeehouse
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go
So how are things going with Paul
So how are things going with you
Great to see you
Good to see you too
He's mad at you
Why
Please, I think you know why
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for
I guess it could
Well then I think that's it
Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay
Tell me about your day
It was fine
What are you thinking right now
Are you talking about having sex
Tell me about your childhood
Normal
That never happened to me
Any regrets
Nope
Anything
Okay
Okay
Okay
All right
When I was six years old
Hm-mmm
They called me chicken boy
Oh, I couldn't eat now
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this
Can I help you
I would like to see that ring please
8,600
Yes, but I can only pay $8,000
Okay, I can let it go at eight
No
You-you were eating pizza
Yeah
That guy is always mooching off of us
All the time
Oh my God
Still crying
And one of them is sex
What's the other one
Oh, we have some
No, did he hug you
I miss my dad
Yeah
Would you hug me
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight
Oh, I can't go
It's over
They put you in jail
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps
Maybe it was the guy
So uh, was he excited about the tickets
He blew us off
What
Me too
Freeze him out
That's right
I like it
I'm back
A lover
A surfer
Oh yeah surfer
While you were talking
So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something
I can't do that
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger
After this, we should solve crimes
Who is it
It is your office
Do you know who at my office
John
I would trade
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart
Of a cough apparently
Oh my God
So you two are really serious
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever
You've bought like a billion of 'em
Yeah, you didn't get one
Okay, well tonight's the big night
Yeah
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her
Ohh
That sounds perfect
Yeah
You're gonna mess it up let me do it
I'm not gonna mess it up
If she says no, can I have the ring
She's not gonna say no
Oh my God, I'm so sorry
Open bar
I think so
I can do that for the kids
I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth
All jokes aside, where is this relationship going
I didn't agree to that
Do you really see this as a long-term thing
I don't know
Y'know, you are 12 years older than her
Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way
I'm sorry
We wanted to wish you good luck
Here
Thank you
So now what's going on here
Oh, hi
Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris
Ohh, nice choice
Yeah
That's what I did to the kids in my building
Yeah, sure
You put your balloons down
Look
Hey
I got me some drinks
What are you doing
Open bar
Well now it's an empty bar
That was my guess
What
You don't guess, you buy
Are you okay
Is everything - are you - are you perrr-perfect
Hey, it's good to see you
You too, you let uh, your hair grow long
Hey, I see you got your mustache back
Hi, I'm Lisa
What were you thinking
I didn't know it was an auction
Wh
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat
Why would a charity give away a free boat
Charity
I'm just helping the kids
How is you drinking helping the kids
Oh hi
Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth
Okay
Okay
Ohh
Good
Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is
If the school finds out you're fired
Hmm
She's leaving for three months
For camp
I don't, I don't see a big future with her
that's your answer
Ugh, I hate this part
Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one
Bowmont at this table
My wife would've killed me
Ohh
She's gonna this boat
What-what is your wife's name
It's Pam
Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam
Aw-awww
I don't think she'd like that
Bowmont
Oooooh
All right
Why do you want to see my hand
I wanna see the trash
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it
We didn't ruin it
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor
Glove salesman
Yeah
What am I going to do
She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track
I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind
Convince her that you're a little coward
I was just thinking about
You suck
Hey
Hey
To declare your love for one another to the world
Eh
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef
So what's up
Well, it was great seeing you the other night
What uh - What did you - What
Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here
I know this is crazy but am I too late
Where was all this three years ago
What were you doing in Africa
Working with blind kids
I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen
My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait
You are
Yeah
Why
I know, they're gonna be so happy together
I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen
Not that often
I'm so happy for them
So happy for them
I'm so happy and not at all jealous
That's nothing
I'm like 90/10
Yeah, but that's pigs not people
97%
Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never
What is this
Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap
We're gonna find love
Definitely
It would be nice to have a little guarantee though
You mean a backup
Exactly
Yeah, yeah I got that
You do
Hm-mmm
Yeah
Are you serious
Yeah, I locked him years ago
Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal
Charming
Well hey, it's just a backup
Or a mirror
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh
Yeah, it's great
It's like it's like something's changed
Maybe you changed
I didn't change
Maybe that's the problem
There are
That-that he's against marriage and always will be
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone
Hey you
Hey, come on in
Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth

I guess so
No like, "What's that
You-you want me to be your backup
Exactly

Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago
Who is it
No
Ahh
You can not have two backups
No we weren't
I was not
You have to pick one
Pick me
Okay that's fair
All right
Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean
Or a mustache
Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that
I think that's fair
Okay, she was here, but she left
Well where did she go
Well she said she had to think things over
I thought you were a good guy
Oh, hey look nothing happened
So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her
Well all right, one thing happened
You made my girlfriend think
Well I'm sorry
I love her
Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not
She's gone
What
She had a bag and she left
What are you talking about
Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan
But she wouldn't believe me
Where did she go
But if I were you I would
I can't believe I ruined this
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been
Oh
He knows what its about
Hey, what's going on

It's happened to you
Once
Well, what'd you do
Oh honey, but it is just about

We were both out there kissing
Keep talking
Not just because it's romantic, but because I can
What
They break your heart, don't they
Y'know, I don't really their permission
If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding
You gotta do something about your eyes
And that'll get rid of my wisdom
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about
Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night
Look uh, if we're gonna do this
She's just gonna think that we're doin' it
I know why
No you don't know why
Why
Because I was sad
What do you mean
Hey
Hi
Who wants French toast

We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music
What in God's name is that
Wh-wh-what are you doing here
So, could I just move in with you for a couple days
I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes
Okay

You tell her Jack, I can't do it
It seemed like such a simple idea
Well what happened at dinner
center
Honey, it's gonna be okay
Do you even understand what off the rack means
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself
I don't have any money
Well, I have some
Are you kidding me
How-how much is it
The answer is no
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down
Yes, I am
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha
Something's on fire
Well no, I don't smell anything
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons
And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop
You just cost me eight dollars a week
You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment
You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back
I'm sorry
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for
His daughter was hot
Hey
I mean, you work, you work really hard for that
Ehh
Eh, you work for that
I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding
You do
We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college
You thought about that
Yeah
How many kids were we gonna have
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy

One of those little uh, portable CD players
Oh, I already have one
Hey, I know I what I want

You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe
Dying people say the craziest things
I was gonna make cookies for my children
Break my heart - Oh, all right
I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies
How's the boat
I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh
It took three guys to get the thing in there
You could
When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat
Your own boat
Do you know what I was thinkin'
Uh why, do you have a lecture
No, why
What's up
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us
Well, did-did you correct him
No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way
He does that every week too
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win
Yeah
He hates to lose
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand
You're not a lefty
We can't accept this
I do stuff like this at work all the time
Really
Okay, we owe you a present
We're not finished with the lesson yet
Uh, boat rope
How do you get the mainsail up
Uhh, rub it
What do you do if I say we are coming about
Time's up, now your dead
Yes
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg
How was it
Umm, Chancy on the other hand
He even said I could call him dad
I can't believe it
I know
You gave my father a lap dance
Why do they put so much steam in there
'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room
Wh-wh-why did that have to happen
Come on, it's not that big a deal
He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years
I don't want him to tell this story for years
I wasn't escaping
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire
I was trying to help out a squirrel
Y'know, they didn't get us anything
Hey
So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey
Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never
Why not
You're mean on the boat
I was just trying to teach you
I was just being a good teacher
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson
Remember
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom
And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer
I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling
You won't boss me around anymore
I won't boss you around
And you'll be nice
And, I'll be nice
This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg
Let's give it a shot
Like a bake sale

Yeah, but not as good as batch 17
Which one was that
Ohh yeah
Right
Nope
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one
I quit
You can't quit
Why not
Greens do not quit
You did and you're still yelling at me
I just wanted you to learn
Well, hey I did learn
Really

Kids love that right
And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032
See - darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day
That's what you think
Wouldn't they have the recipe
My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse
What was her name

And not just on TV
Wh-what are we gonna tell him
Well, the lighting was okay
You got lighting last time, lighting is mine

And say nothing
Kinda in the middle of a story here
You finish, go

It's a different building
When do you want me to start
Why don't we start right now
Why would you think that
I mean, who looks more me than me right
Oh-ohh, thank you
Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody
But I hired you
What
You're my new assistant
I am
Yeah
I can't believe it
Hey
Good, you're home
Hey
I made you a surprise
Oh yeah
Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them
Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner
Uhh, those are tacos
Married couples can't keep secrets from one another
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again
Hi
Hey
Is she working out
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes
Was she happy you gave her the job
That was you
Today, I got nothin'
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there
Because they wanted me to audition
Hi
That's a great name
Hi
It's hopeless
Yeah
Let's not do that
Ohh, absolutely
Do you have a minute
Well yeah, sure, what's up
by guys
Oh really
Did you tell someone that I was gay
Oh, did you not want people to know that
And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay
Why's that
Okay
'Kay
Well
Hey
What's the matter
Licked my neck
Oh Willie's still alive
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist
That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty
Yeah, I'm not in that
I know, but look at me all tan
How about those three pointers
Hey, I thought that guy was married
Maybe you know him
Hey, divorced men are not bad men
They have that on the napkins at the club
Oh, I gotta get back to work
You don't have to be back for a half-hour
I mean y'know you can't date him right
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else
He's dating that slut in marketing
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club
Dude that is so sad
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag
I just did them
Oh, well drop and give me ten more
What
Did those cost reports come in
Yeah, I filled them out last night
Umm, is Tag here
Why
Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight
But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight
Oh no
All right, back to work
I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable
All right, I guess this will be fine
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight
Nothing, why
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him
I'll really appreciate it
Yeah, okay
Why did you ever sleep with me
I'm having a really good time
I'm sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck
My God
I'll go
Hi Ginger
I want my key back
We'll talk about it later
Watching ballroom dancing
Like what
She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you
Okay
She uses sex as a weapon
At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons
You're still gonna go out with her
Yeah
Good morning
We went to the Knicks game
You mean like old women
A little
Hey
Hey
So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night
What
Y'know, all the women
Finally
Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women
Really
There I am
Hi
Hi
Has she cooked your rabbit yet
You think he's emotionally unavailable
I think he can be
Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night
Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life
Another night of birdogging the chickas
I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore
I did not see that coming
You don't care about this stuff
When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend
Really
Someone I can spoil, y'know
Sp-spoil
Let me ask you something
Uh-huh
Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone
Hell yes
All right then, it's settled
Okay
I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend
I'd love to
My God
Good, you're both here
We kinda need to talk
Both of you together
Oh just say it Kyle
We're gonna give it another try
What about her whining and her constant need for attention
I'm gonna work on that
I do know
In fact, hey I'm over it already
Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to
My mom sent me the paper
Ooh, let's see it
Yeah, we look great together
Yeah, we really do
Okay
Imagine what our kids would look like
Y'know, we don't have to imagine
I'm marrying her
I hope it's you
Oh
Hypothetically
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea
Wh-why is that the best part
I'm really not deciding
Die Hard still great
Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature
What'd you rent
And
Die Hard
Is everything okay
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans
Yeah
Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor
Really
Well, if that's what you want
But why does it even matter
Why does it matter so much to you
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know
What happened
Well, I don't know
That is all
All right, well uh, I'd better go
I think that would be best
All right, I'll talk to you later
she wished me good luck
So uh, what did this woman look like
Who is she
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend
Why
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow
Fat
I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow
You broke up with a girl because she was fat
Does she still feel bad
This is exactly why you shouldn't lie
I am maid of honor
Na-uh, I am
How come you are
Because I cared enough to lie
Can't we just flip a coin
Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio
Hi
No we don't
Now look, that was the best nap I ever had
I don't know what you are talking about
That was the best nap you ever had
I've had better
When
It was the best nap ever
Uh-huh
I want to do it again
We can't do it again
Why not
Because it's weird
Do you want something to drink
Can you figure out what I'm doing
You're Lewis Posin
Who
That was like 16 years ago
It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me
No, 10 is the highest
Okay, uh
I've got cold feet
it's gonna be okay
Thank you judges
Ugh, what a kiss ass
Oh
Perfect score
She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony
It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre
Yeah, it really was
It's pretty clear
I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight
I won
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me
Why-why would I care about that
Then you wouldn't have to apologize
I would really love it if could do both
I have to ask
What
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again
What
How much weight could she have gained
A hundred and forty-five pounds
You called me fat
Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different
How
I said that behind you back
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall
Hi
Oh yeah
Why
Great nap
Morning
Oh, how was your date last night
Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work
You're gonna leave this person with me
Are you kidding
Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me
That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig
Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me
Hi
Hi
Why are we here
Sorry
Uh
You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you
Well, she saw the ring
Right
Huh
You said no right
I mean, what was I supposed to do
I mean it won't be so bad
You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she
She's probably not gonna even want to come
Really
See how easy that was
So-so you would've just lied
Yes
Would it really have been that easy
Still here
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time
Then-then there's you guys
Today was great, thanks
I know
I'll uh, I'll call ya
Oh and I'll call ya too
Or I'll call you
Bye
Bye-bye
And y'know we got to talking and I
We want you to marry her
What
You have no idea
Who do you think brought her here
She speaks four languages
I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch
Yeah, but you always say that
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere
Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so
People are doing it in front of my book
Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing
All right, so we should go catch our movie
Well look who's here
Hey
Oh no
A birthday party
Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437
Hey
Hey
How did it go with Erin
We had the best time
Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore
That was so awkward, we were really nervous
Didn't you sleep together
Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up
He might still show up
It's been three hours
Is that all
Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding
We're not even sure why we're having it
It's actually going to be just family
The Mets have no closer
What about Benitez
What about Game 1 of the Series
Uh, okay
Did ya just change your mind
Kinda
Then change it back
It's just there's no real spark
Didn't you sleep together
Yeah
Y'know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something
Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner
I'm sorry
Yeah, let's go
See you guys later
Bye guys
Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here
How can I help you
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist
I find Marion's views far to progressionist
You're the person who checked out my book
you're so young
Hey
Hey
Hi
So how was, how was your date
She said she wants to go away with you
Where are you gettin' this
She said she's kinda a loner
Yeah
What are we gonna do
Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do
we'll just let her stay
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever
Kinda like your Barca lounger
Is that what you're thinking about right now
Why not
You have to go
He does
Say again
And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding
Shhhh
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year
You have to name all the states in six minutes
Oh, okay, time's up
Wow, how many have you got
'Cause you invited your assistant
I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin
That's impossible
I-forgot-ten-states
It makes you want to kill yourself
All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner
no dinner
Oh, it's not
Seriously, it's moving
How come we don't hang out here more often
It's like old pumpkins or something
That's my pie
Which smells delicious
Uh-oh
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue
We kinda broke up this morning
Oh, I'm sorry
Yeah, so she went back to Ohio
Where is the dog
There-there's no dog here
Why
What
Are you crazy
Are you out of your mind
You don't like ice cream
It's too cold
s
1250
Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question
Oh, I'd say about a month
Interesting
Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point
A moo-point
What he needs right now is for you to be his friend
Okay, that's what I'm gonna do
Hey
Hey
How are you holding up
Not bad
I'm sorry about your girlfriend
Thanks
So were you guys together a long time
I don't anymore
Now that she broke up with you
Yeah
Hmmmm
Do you ever have that feeling
it has to work out
Why
Because, uh - it has to
You have all the answers, don't you
I really do
I like you back
you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah
We can be strong
He's not so smart
I didn't know either
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you
You can't go in there
She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing
Well, I, I should go in there
She doesn't want to see you right now
Why not
Bring the dog back, you're a hero
No, no he went for a walk
Oh no, the dog's not going to be there
Hi, honey
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me
Oh my god
That's right, she came back all by herself
I-I think, I should be able to eat something
How are you doing
I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots
Oh
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace
Okay
So, we're okay
Um, I'm not
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out
You sure
His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting

Yeah
Ohh

Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire

Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker
What is the matter with you
And, I told them all about your candy
What did you tell 'em
I told 'em your candy is absolutely indescribable
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever
Y'know what would work
Hmm
Stop making candy
But they like it
You mean they like you
Maybe
You have to learn how to ride a bike
Why do I have to learn
In-in case of emergency
Okay

The end
Awesome

Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet
Here's Joseph Francis
I left you a note
That doesn't give you the right to ditch me
I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much
Hi
They delivered it to the wrong address again
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem
I can't seem to say goodbye

Joan
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me

Why not
Why do you want to come anyway
Well, thank you for lunch
Maybe she'll be gone for months
We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake
No that could kill her
Well, we don't want that
No so we're protecting her
But we should take it
But we should move quick
Why
Umm, God you look phenomenal

Oh, hey Aunt Millie

I don't get out of the lab much
I got to admit, I thought it was something else

Don't say it
Hey, y'know you could always visit him
Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport
There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it
Stick to your side
Are you leaving
Well
1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too

She's sleeping
Beep
I can't believe this
Damn you Oprah
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway
It'd be fun
Okay that does sound like fun
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest
It's a little more comfortable
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them
You wanna go down to the office right now
I have to do it
But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't
No
Well, you be careful
He won't have a father if-if I die
It's not here
How could I have left them in the copy room
Just go please
Are you still awake
What are you doing
Do you know what just happened
We-we had sex and then we fell asleep
What
So please wake up so we can do it right
Come on big fella
Okay
Still no luck
Did you check all the drawers
You put these on my desk
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute
That's not mine
Yes it is
Because the last time I checked this was still America
Okay, do-do you have a good grip
Yeah
Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now
Just hurry up
I think face to face
I would say that
Face to face, yeah
Okay, here I go
So what do you want me to do
Hi
It's still looks pretty far
Just drop
I have to be up in seven minutes
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes
Really
Do you wanna
Hey
Hey
What are you doing
Come on help me move this
No
No
Rosita does not move
As in
Oh my God
What happened to the window in the attic
I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house
your comfort first
They kept your room for a while
Come on, you know they love you
As much as they love you
Hey
Hey
Ugh, I hate this year
Oh that's right
Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing
What
I'm the supply manager
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs
Okay, what was wrong with that call
Oh
Dad
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore
I used to love to play restaurant
Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit
What
Y'know how the garage floods every Spring
You don't secretly smoke do you
No
I don't need any toner
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner
Not me
May I ask why
You wanna know why
I surely do
Thanks anyway, bye-bye
I-I'm sorry
You will like it
You don't even know
We could name her Francette
That's weird
I'm sure there's some explanation
Well no
Miracle
Or something
It's not like I did it on purpose
Oh my God, does she really thinks that
The doctor said your mother could
Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it
Really
Ooh-ooh, what about this
how's the uh, miracle chair
Fine
Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest
Really
That sounded like someone being nice to you
I'd like to take him with me
Oh sorry, boyfriend
Oh no
Anything
Hey guy
Hey
Umm, your boxes are umm
What
Dad
I'm sorry
Just mine
That's why I replaced it with mine
That's how it got fixed
Your chair
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs
This chair's not going anywhere
That's right
The lady who sells toner
I can't let you do it
Why
Because it was fate that made me call you today
I thought it was toner
My mom killed herself
Really
Yes
How
this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this
Couldn't it just be a coincidence
No, it's fate
It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate
My mother was also a supply manager
I'm actually the office manager
Her name was Pearl, P-Earl
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm
Yeah-yeah
Your mother's right, I do look like an ass
Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right
All right
Oh yeah
Hey
Happy birthday
Good ones
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago
Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam
Do you know how old the Earth is
Good friends
Come on
Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there
I have always been into cars
Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something
I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well
Least of all you
What you'd do
All of your friends are in there and your parents
Noo
Yes
Noo
We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk
You promise
So, when you go in, act surprised
I can do that
Right, why do you keep saying that
Oh, it's you
What
Yeah, we're not thirty, we're 31
Nu-uh
That's what is says on my birth certificate
You have your birth certificate
Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died
Do you have my birth certificate
Yeah
Your middle name is Pamela
Yes
Do you remember what it is
That's my first name
Ahh
Open ours next
Okay
I wanna marry this plan
I didn't even have to take off my top yet
Come on
It'll be okay
Like what
Oh man
What
My turn just started
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag
Hey, can I ride this outside
Not in the street
Hey
Hey
Are you feeling any better
Umm
What's up
This is just because you're turning thirty
I mean you're 25
Twenty-four actually
How'd it go
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds
You wanna buy a car
You okay
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony
I would love to read a poem
Ohhh
Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too
Too
Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys
Do you mind telling us what it is
Hey
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and
What is DOOL
My character is coming out of his coma
Oh
That's great
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life
Who are they killing off
Noo
She's my favorite character on DOOL
And the way she slaps all the time
Don't do it
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress
Why
why do you get the story
I get the phone
Nice try
How do we fairly decide who gets the phone
Oh yes there is
How do you do that
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are
You're not the fan who's dying are you
I-I'm the guy in the coma
Who told you that
Oh uh, one of the writers
Was it bald or was it tall
Umm
Because it is not true
And then whoever does gets the phone
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone
What is that
Nooo
It's not even a song
Hi
How are ya
Yeah
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone
Ooh, now you lost me
You stole the phone
No I didn't
So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring
You do know that I will be here when he comes over
And how will you know what time to come over
You just said it
Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show
Yeah, thanks
They love you so much
Oh thank you so much
Is that supposed to be me
Yeah
Well, I feel like a snack
Eh that's Scottish like you are
I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage
Sitting down and being quiet
How did you know about that
We heard you play all the way from your apartment
Were you the ones called the cops
Why not
Because we hate them
I mean you haven't even heard me play
We have heard you play
You're so talented
An actor of a certain age is not that easy
Ohh, I turned down some amazing work
Why do you get to answer the door
Well why shouldn't I
Because it's my apartment
Umm, no
Could you-could you umm, give us one second
Sure
We'll be right back sir
Wh-what do we do
You're such a great friend
Well, you certainly own that room
Hi
I am such a huge fan
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore
You seem really, really nice
Okay, bye-bye
You are so beautiful
What
They never send the script
Oh noo
Well of course not, but you were very good
Thanks
I got another job
Well-well what is it
A film in Guadalajara
Well how-how, how will you be gone
Eight months
That's a really long time
You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful
Good luck
Sing along
Hi
Hi Ben
Hi
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency
Don't talk to me now
Awww, just like his daddy
Well, Ben would be there
Huh umm
What's the matter
Uh, what do I, what do I do with him
Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive
Not really
Uh, want something-want something to drink
Okay
How do you feel about Diet Coke
What's a virgin
I kinda liked him
You mean the spitter
It wasn't that bad
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil
All right, what about the third guy
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest
Well then we still have a problem
Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff
Are you serious
A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal
I call it
It was my idea
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us
Does calling it not mean anything anymore
'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend
But you're not anymore
No, I'm not
'Cause you guys were on a break
Sharing is good
I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other
You like that one
Can I do it to you
We're never gonna find anybody
Everyone knows I'm an ass man
It might be kinda cool
So I can do it
Yeah you can do it
Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right
Yeah
A horrible headache
Can I get you something
What is it
I have a bone to pick with you
Uh-oh
Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere
Oh that
They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them
Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny
Say what
They just put it on there for legal reasons
Why
Hey
You got ordained
Man, there is a lot of porn out there
Okay
Hi
Can I ask what - Come on in
Okay
Don't do that
Don't do that
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks
Oh damnit
Oh damnit
Don't say that
Damnit
Go back to repeating
Damnit
Oh crap
Are you ready
How about receiving
It doesn't say that
Nice stories
I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey
There you go
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid
I call that London style
And well we drank too much
Oh
But then later that night
So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya
I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight
Well, not anymore
But we don't do that
I know, I just thought it would be fun
How drunk are you
What
This doesn't feel weird
I know
Hm-hmm
You are really fast
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you
We're gonna see each other naked
Yep
Do you wanna do it at the same time
Count of three
One
Two
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined
Eh, we weren't that close anyway
Oh, dude I'm so sorry
No
Yeah
There's some really nice girls down there
I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me
What
This is crazy
So now what have we agreed
No more pranks
And-and what else
That you and daddy were not on a break
What are you doing here
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol
Your good friend
Yeah
What's her last name
Lesbian
And by the way that uh, that line down my face
I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already
Hi
What's not funny
Practical jokes
I think they're funny
But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting
Okay
I don't want you to be upset
And you just know it's gonna last forever
That's what you should say
What
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say
I can do it
Hey
Oh I
Hey
Hey-hey
What's my little chef got for me tonight
Since when are you into swing music
I will
Do you want me to call
You just stick to your job
What is your job
There were only twelve
Oh yeah, I added three
I-I am Kristen
I'd love to show you around sometime
I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over
Ah
What do you say I take you to dinner tonight
Oh I'd like that
Yeah
I'm Megan Bailey
Oh, thanks for the tip
So-so when are you getting married
Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on
I do the same thing
Oh May 15th
Oooh it's getting close
Yeah
So uh, who's your photographer
Jeffery
Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did
Wow
Oh, who's your band
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings
My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass
I'm moving in
Oh uh, can I give you a hand
Boyfriend

Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight
Oh I, I have plans tonight
Oh
Okay
Got it
Hurry
You came
Yeah
This is my dress
No
You saw me wearing it
And now you'll see me buying it
You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me
Did you find the dress
Hey
Yeah
When'd you meet her
Two days ago
How'd it go
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her
So, how do we decide
I date her
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
This can go on for a while
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street
I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that
I was thinking more like a hundred
What
What do I do
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it
Oh thanks
What time are you meeting her
00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero
You'd better get dressed
That's right
You're screwed
Thanks for stopping by though
Yeah I can break the rules too y'know
What are you gonna do
I don't know
I'm not gonna let you get away with this
I don't think you have much choice
Well we'll see
But I love swing music
And there's another reason too
Well, what is the other reason
I don't want to say
you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes
Oh great
Yeah
Is your back feeling better
Hi
What are you doing here
Our table will be ready in a couple minutes
That's right, don't you play a woman
A woman in a man's body
Have you ever been married
Yeah, little Eric
Wait no, Ben
So you've just married the one time then
Well umm
You've been married twice
No
Were you on a poster for gonorrhea
Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy
When do you think we lost her
Do you another boyfriend in there or something
We only mess around at his place
So could you come out here please
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress
That's great
Yeah but I'm not keeping it
Well then why can't I see it
Really
Wh-why do you to return it
Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings
It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you
Well, maybe a little
Good for you
I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy
No-no
Oh Soap Opera Digest award
I'm up for a Soapie
Many are scheduled to appear
What kinda noise
Just a high pitched intimidating noise
Yes sir
Well you need 60% to pass
What'd I get
Seven
That's not so good
What-what happened there Ned
I'm sort of in love
Well I'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem
I'm in love with you
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this
I do that too, with my shampoo bottle
Really
Yeah
What award are you practicing for
Grammy, Best New Artist
The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award
Ohh that's great
Yeah
I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation
Y'know
You practice losing the Grammies too
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win
Oh hey
Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I
I'm never gonna have a first kiss again
Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie
There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me
There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me
Not right now
It-it - The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm
I guess I can cut him some slack
Yeah
How'd you get over that teacher
Do you have your speech
Yeah, I got my speech
You hug me
Can I squeeze your ass
Yeah
There was a whole table full of 'em
I'll take it back tomorrow
So could you change my grade
No
Well why not you changed Ned's grade
Because he, he was actually in love with me
He's done this with three other teachers
What
He's got a girlfriend
I can't believe someone would do that for a grade
I just got to talk to him about all this
No that is the last thing you want to do
Why
Your mother told you this
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley
Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Do you ever get scared at all
What
Y'know that rush
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating
Really
I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back
Why
It's not gonna work
We gotta go
I'm sorry, do I know you
You got it
But the audition went really good
Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese
What's the matter
They want me to be totally naked in the movie
Wow
My grandmother's gonna see this
Are you getting nervous
Cassie
Uh-hmm
Hey
Yeah
Subtle guys
What
What did you decide to do about the movie
And the nudity is really important to the story
That's what you say about porn
Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back
Come on
Well when can we have this shower
We have Friday
What is the other option
Yesterday
What time
Food
Finger sandwiches and tea
And chili
Uh, flowers or balloons
Both
We're paying for this y'know
Neither
Umm, what should we do for the theme
Hey
Hey
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding
Oh boy me too
a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
Yeah
What do you think, bossy and domineering
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill
Nice to meet you too
So, are you ready to go
What - why
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her
You were staring about eight inches south of there
By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again
That's great
Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity
Do you know what I'm saying
Yes
Okay
What
An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be
So to get this part you can't be
Nope
But you are
Yep
But you told them you weren't
grow a turtleneck
Unless
Unless what
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion
And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list
Hey
Do you mind if I raid your fridge
Are you makin' him a sandwich
So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't
Ah yeah, sorry about that
Come, come on in
Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions
Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me
hot dog
Hi
Yeah
Who the hell are all these people
I was her accountant four years ago
You were supposed to tell her
Fine, I'll go call her
And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks
Oh, just until the glue dries
Ow
Toothpick
Yeah
What are you trying on now
The fruit roll up
And
We have a winner
Which one
For what
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower
And then for forgetting to invite you to it
You al-you already had it
We ruined everything
Ugh
And it kinda works out for the best
Surprise
And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right
Yeah
My whole family's from Naples
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there
I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren
Shut up
I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear
Now, are you friends with Ralph
No
What-what are you doing tomorrow night
Um
You're having dinner with me
It's Ray-ray
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college
She seems really, really fun
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close
What
What
kissing for a bit
Stop picturing it
They all look like they're having fun don't they
They're gonna be crushed
Parents are comin'
Y'know I think we should invite them
Oh please, you just want more blue pins
Well this is just sad
You mean like for award shows
You look fabulous
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw
Pierce Brosnan
Uh-huh
Are you serious
Yeah
This is James Bond's tux
Yeah
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux
Nice move
Hey
I'm not wearing a tux
Well, what are you going to wear
Ooh, and maybe a hat
Do you want to go to a movie tonight
What's going on
Okay
It-it did
Why are you taking this away from me
I'm just saying that this happened
Yeah
'Cause I just can't picture it
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head
But not just any tux, Batman's tux
What
that Batman film he was in
James Bond's tux
So
So - If you wear that you'll make mine less special
Pretty please
Not very uh, 007
If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you
When I got married you slept with my sister
Hey
feel a little unwanted
It's true, but too bad
No she hasn't
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you
Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon
What one
Yeah
we made out
Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you're talking about
Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond
007 has all those gadgets
Batman has a utility belt
007 has a fancy car
Batman has the Batmobile
Actually, I don't like martinis
The show
Right
Have you ever been to one of my weddings
The wedding starts at six
I vamp a little 'til they get there
How can you not remember us kissing
I don't remember a lot of things that never happened
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping
She didn't
Hey
You just carry that around
I find it to be something of a conversation piece
The pants are a little tight
I could see double-oh and seven in those pants
I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours
What
I don't care
What the hell was that
I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about
And
Whose is it
All that matters is that you look so handsome
Whose is it
I don't want to say
Whose is it
Four weeks
Do you realize you get louder each week
So uh, have you written yours yet
But I know exactly what I'm going to say
She made no such promise
What
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress
Would you go out with me
It's kind of an important one
Oh, cute, cute
How come they get two
You'll get one
When
Why won't I be married when I'm 40
I just meant hypothetically
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40
No, no, no
What
I can't believe this
No I didn't
Yes, you did
No I didn't
You love me
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here
Then all your stuff would be here
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married
How's the Mrs
I've had a very long, hard day
Want some
No chicken, bye-bye then
He kept asking me about chicken
I don't know why they didn't just tell us
No one knows
When
It happened in London
You can't
OH MY GOD
It's okay
THEY'RE DOING IT
I KNOW
YOU KNOW
What
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie
Bye
Actually, I did
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me
Well I didn't tell them
I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell
So
Are you kidding
They know you know
She wants me to put lotion on her
Ooh
Ooh
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss
I can't have sex with ya
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things
You really think it would be that different
Well, things change
Hey, who's this little naked guy
That little naked guy would be me
Aww, look at the little thing
Can we be grown-ups now
Who are those people
How old was she there
Hey, you guys
Hey
Hey
If that's what you really want
Oh that's so sweet
So we both finished our vows
Oh
Hey
Okay
You really like it
You can't do that
Hey
Hey
Hey
Okay, I drive it all the time
That was a brisk ride
Take the top down did ya
I am an excellent driver
That adds up to a bad driver
Gimme the keys
No way
Well no brush
He's your father; he should be at the wedding
I haven't seen him in years
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles
My God
So why don't you just hand over the keys
Get in the front
In the death seat
Hey guys
Hey
Hey sweetie
How long have you been going out
Over a month
Sure, I'd like that
Yeah, big fan
What's this
It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law
Y'know we already went over this and I won
That's a, that's a pretty great dad
Girabaldi
Girabaldi
you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you
Yes
So I really never get to win anymore
Yeah
he was wearing women's underwear
We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on
That's weird
I'm wearing his briefs right now
kinda hot
Great for holding my lipstick
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that
I'm thinking even more than you
I don't think you could ever do that
I am secure with my masculinity
Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble
You think so
And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either
Hello darlings
I'll go under, you go over
Oh my God
Can I see your license please
well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest
That's Hanson
Oops sorry, my mistake
Dear Lord
Wow
Here it comes
This is a great picture
Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed
Well you look phenomenal
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago
Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there
Yes I am
Yeah
You're an Aquarius, huh
I bet you're a Gemini
Nope
Taurus
Nope
Virgo
Nope
Sagittarius
Yep
I knew it, ahh
Well I tell you what
Yeah
You're not gonna speed anymore right
I won't speed
And you promise you'll get this taken care of right away
I promise
Does he have a license
Yeah
Can he handle the stick
Oh well
Gay
That can't be your father
Oh my God
What
Bakersfield
I'm just sorry
Manly and also kind of a slut
Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about
Uh-huh
Feels really good
Huh
And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear
Uh-huh
And y'know what I've always wondered about
You must've had terribly fascinating parents
Where are you from
Hallelujah
Remind me to introduce you to someone
Who
Good evening officer
Do you know how fast you were traveling back there
I had the weirdest dream last night
Oh my God
Feel better
Hi
Do I know you from somewhere
I don't think so
I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives
Wow
Yeah
Really
The old ball and chain
Old
The young hot ball and chain
What's up
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward

No problem

Me too
Really
Jack

Bing
Nora
Charles
It-it's so great to see you both here

But I don't know what he looks like
I'm Amanda
Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it
I'll do it
Anybody
I said I'll do it
I'm not gonna screw it up
Where have you been
Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel
Oh
Are you going back to work
Yeah
Nice shades
Hey
What
drank the last of the milk
They-they just redid my make-up
Just the last two pages
What picture
I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction
And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff
Oh, thanks
But you're spittin' all over me man
Well of course I am
No, I haven't seen him
Oh damn
He's getting married tomorrow right
We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding
I certainly see what the girls like coming here
Your mother just added him to her list
Your-your list
Yeah, the list that - of people we're allowed to sleep
Action
I found the picture
What picture
In your pack
You went through my personal property
Great scene yeah
You soaked me
Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow
Oh man
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue
It's just so sad
Oh
I found one
Oh my God
Hey, can this count as her something new
Right
Okay
Do you know what kind of birth control she was using
Why
Anything
You told them he was missing
I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night
All right, well how much time do you need
Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready
One hour
Give me two
Okay, wish me luck
I'm going with you
And clearly you suck at this
All right, I'll see you guys later
Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her
I'll figure something out
Good luck
I-I, I need you to talk to me
About what
I'm never gonna getting married
Become a lesbian or something
I'm having surgery
But, I'm having surgery today
What kind of surgery
Transplant
But you're supposed to work on Monday
Hair transplant
But you're not bald
Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot
I'm wearing two belts
Are you drunk
No
Yes you are
That is an old, Chinese woman
He could be in disguise, y'know
So this is your office
I knew I should've hid at the gym
What the hell are you doing
How is she
Now come on, we're going home
I can't do that
Why not
I can't be the Bings
What's wrong with being the Bings
No
Then you are neither of your parents
But I totally believe you can do this
It's too huge
Can you just come home and take a shower
But wait
What
Let's go to lunch
I can't go to lunch
Oh
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you
Let's reset
Owwwwww
Can you pull it together
I can do this
Thank you
Still rolling, annnnd action
I wanna wear this everyday
Everything's fine
Damnit
Where are you
The wedding is in less than an hour
The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this
I'm gonna have to find another minister
All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now
Now that wasn't so scary, was it
No
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time
Hey I-I can do that
I just want to get a little fresh air
Okay
Okay
Are they Greek Orthodox
I thought he was with you
Hide and seek
But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then
Are you okay
Uh-huh
Well, you're-you're sweating
These-these are beads of joy
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork
That's it, we're done for the day
Well have we finished the scene
you were wonderful
As were you
So I got your car, it's right outside
Are we done for the day
Oh
You know
Talking about what
You don't know
Know what - If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now
you're not freaking out
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3
Our little boy is getting married
This is nice
What
Oh I wish you're grandmother had lived to see this
Not now
Do you take each other
I do
I do
Yeah you do
Rings
What baby
Our baby
I didn't take a pregnancy test
Oh and they're gonna have a baby
Once and a while
From time to time
You still get nervous everybody just before a show
Absolutely
Watch again that hand
This'll be five/ten takes
Okay
You know it's gonna happen
'Cause you've got more to say
The camera hit our wall
Oh yeah
With Operation
But le Blanc really doesn't mess up much
You mess up
True or false
I don't necessarily like to juice things
Ooh-ooh
What are you doing
You're still a tiny bit on fire there
It was great seeing you the other night
Did you come down here to tell me that
You had to work early on with a monkey
That damn monkey
'Cause it's not silly
Here we go
Okay
I mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it
Mornin'
I'm doing my brother
Action
But there was one story
We're visiting
Yay
Y'know, you might as well say it because I told your
Da
Huh
Da
Nothing
So that you will intentionally do something that - they'll-they'll intentionally screw it up
Yeah
Okay, we're good
Action
I'm sorry
Piv-at
Okay Friends gang, thanks for doing it
Well thank you so much
Thank you Conan
Oh what are doing
You're still a tiny bit on fire there
I think you got it
I'm sorry, I messed up
Is that why you guys had to get married
You-you-you're not pregnant
What are you talking about
Who's the father
Yeah
I can't say
Why
Why not
James Brolin is the father of my baby
As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin
How about just the bridemaids
I was told it was kinda big deal
Oh my God
You said that she was, I just didn't disagree with you
Sneaky
Oh yeah
Uh-hmm
James Brolin
and then I remembered he's gay
Before we go out there I've got a present for ya
Honey, I'm going to put my hand in your pocket
No
No
I've been taking dancing lessons
What
I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget
Oh that is so sweet
Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife
What's the matter
I don't know, it's these new shoes, they're all slippery
Well, are you going to be able to do this
So, are you ready to talk about it
Now
No
Okay, we'll talk about something else then
Thank you
Who's the father
I'll stop
I am not going to tell you until I tell him
I've always kinda hated it
Aw come on, Mona Lisa
Uh-huh
No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world
I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips
Congratulations
Thank you
Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover
Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so
Oh, I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions
Dennis Phillips
How did you guys meet
The only think left would be radio, and that's just for ugly people
What size shoes do you wear
Let's not talk about that right now
This is so huge
Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding
Between me and you
How
Maybe they have tools
Y'know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own
Well, maybe that's, maybe that's really brave
I just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be
Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that well
Are you okay
Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin
Maybe you're not pregnant
Are you sure you peed on the stick right
How many ways are there to do that
I'm-I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're a hundred percent sure
All right, I'll-I'll take it again when I get home
Come on, do it as a present to me
Thank you
Okay
I'll run out and get you one
Oh, you guys are so great
Who's is the father
Oh no, she won't tell us
That can be my present
Wh - Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick
Hi
Umm, would you like to dance
Sure
Yeah
Ohhhh
You can dance on my feet
Uh-huh
And the world will never know
Did you talk to Dennis about me yet
I told him all about Days Of Our Lives
Now he just thinks I'm a soap actor
You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet
Thank you
No-no, thank you Miranda
How cute was that
Can I go next
I am so gonna score
What
So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there
Oh my God, that was for my benefit
And if didn't see it up there, just-just try me
Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor
How much longer
30 seconds
Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me
Okay
Okay
Umm, it's negative
What
No, it's positive
What
It's-it's not negative, it's positive
Are you sure
Well yeah, I lied before
Oh
Oh God
Now you know how you really feel about it
Oh-oh, that's a risky little game
With who
Ah, it's still not the time
I just didn't see the fast song coming
Oh, thank you
That is so sweet
Yeah
We got the honeymoon
That's not 'til Thursday
The wedding pictures
They won't be ready for weeks
What did you take a picture of
Thread
Where are the disposable cameras
What disposable cameras
Remember last night I told you to take them
No you didn't
So you don't have the cameras
Sorry man
I'll-I'll help you look for them
Great
Hey
A tiny salt shaker
For tiny salt
Well that was fun
Oh yeah
Okay
Any morning sickness
The guys don't know yet do they
Is it that tall guy from the first floor
No
I think he's cute
Well then you have his baby
Believe me I'm trying
You're like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism
Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news
He's a father and everything's different
I mean, I'm not gonna ask him for anything
' and then bam
What was that bam
'Cause I will track him down and kick his ass
Who's David Lynn
Did you find the cameras
Did you
Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed
Are you serious
Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down
Really
What about the chairs
She picked those out too
How about the place settings
That was her
What did you do
Ooh, did you do it yet
Why not
Bus
You kept saying how huge this all is
Well-well but it is huge
Okay
Okay
You can't marry him
Oh my God
We don't know
I wonder if that dude
There's a dude
Yeah
It didn't click
I heard it
But there was no flash
Uh, your finger was covering the lens
Go
Oh, he's in there right now
What to you want to do
Uh, let's rip
I'll get a picture of you doing the speech
A '95 LeSabre
Yes
A green LeSabre
Yes
I'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre
Okay, you ready for the last picture
Okay
I'm ready for more
What is that
How'd it go
What-what did Tag say
Oh wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is
What
What
No
I only offered
A Salami Buddy
It's picture time
That is a great picture
You kissed another woman
How you doing
Good, long time no see
Yeah
Like your sweater
She - Well, she's one crazy lady
Aren't you excited we're going on our honeymoon
Have a great honeymoon
I'd better go pack
How do you know
Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood
Good luck
Yeah, bye
Maybe you and I should do something
Well you can let me in later
I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you
They took mine to give to you
Why would they take away our keys
Maybe they don't trust us
Hey, I washed those
No you didn't
Yeah that didn't sound like me
I really need my guitar
Yeah, I have stuff in there too
No why
Oh she was looking for you
Oh well, I guess I'll catch up with her later
Well, she really wanted to talk to you now
Yeah, it seemed pretty important
Oh no
What
Really
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is
What-what else could it be
Oh wow, I don't feel well
They're kissing let's just go around them
Oh honey, leave them alone, they're in love
But in an orderly fashion
We are on our honeymoon
Grab my ass
We're on our honeymoon
Bing you'll be in 25K
Damnit
You trust me with yours
Treeger, what are you doing
You said there was a gas leak in here
Do you know what they have in there
Just act like you belong
I can't see the seat number
and certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends
What
In fact, I have some time right now
We-we used a condom
I know, but y'know condoms only work like 97% of the time
Well they should put that on the box
Oh well I may as well have
I was really freaked out too when I found out
As a consumer
Anyway uh, I'll get moving on that new door
Well I'm gonna have to put on a new lock, they'll find out anyway
Hi
Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today
What happened to the door
I really need to talk to her
With my child
That is brand new information
You already know don't you
A little bit
How are you doing
It's just I don't think I handled it very well
Well, what did you say to her
I gotta go find her
They should put that on the box
I can't believe we're here
You have been screwing us all day
Who are you
We're you just ten seconds later
I mean you're not the only ones on your honeymoon
What else is new
Yeah and we'd go check it out, but you took away our keys
Get in there
I guess I could break down your door
Uh we-we need to talk
Because I've kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here
What married
Well yeah, I think we should get married
What, because that's your answer to everything
No, because that's the right thing to do
but still you can't possibly do this alone
I can too eat by myself
When have you ever
When certain people leave the table and I am not finished
Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup
But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone
Oh my God
There it is, I see it
I'll give you two a minute
Okay
Pretty amazing huh
I don't see it
What
I can't see it
You-you just said that you did
I see it now
Do you really
Yeah
Sweetie that's it
Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you
You're welcome
I can't believe that's our baby
Hi
Hey
So how was the doctor
Oh, everything went great
Good
Oh
Hi sweetie
So how was the honeymoon
They were on their honeymoon too
They're terrific, and they live right here in the city
If you just got a chance
didn't get a chance to
You have got to be kidding me
We didn't get anything for anyone
Yeah nice necklace
Hi
Hey
Hello
Welcome home
So, how was the honeymoon
I mean you're having a baby
What is
The lie you just told
That-that you came on to me
There's the one
I mean, let's be honest
You know you kissed me first
You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place
I was sending you signals
What matters is what happened
I mean, am I sending you these signals right now
I can't believe he taped the two of them having sex
Such a rookie mistake
I wanna call 'em
Let's call 'em
What
You got fake numbered
People don't do that
Oh I think we do
Why would they do that
You asked all those insightful, great questions
Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot
Pervert
Okay, listen I am not a pervert
Umm, a personal thing
Hey
Hey
I'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about
About uh, you showering with your mom
I'm, I'm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise
Whoa, for like months
Five to be lying, six
Whoa that's rough
It has to go well okay - I'm scared for my health
I swear any woman that hears it; they're like putty
Well then tell it to me
Umm, this is great wine
Really
Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking
I think its Tibidabo
How did your date go
Your story sucks
Show me how you did it
don't want to
I'm not feeling it
I was just outside Barcelona, hiking
Are you hot
I'm always hot
I'll try that
All right
Thanks
Good luck
Hi
Were you just talking to yourself
Yeah, definitely
I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong
Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes
Well maybe it was all of your questions
What about my questions
The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler
Hell yeah
I am not gonna show you this
Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it
Forget it, she's destroying it
So, end of story
I wanna see it
What
There I am
Kinda hurtin' my hand though
Okay, in about ten seconds you're gonna see him kiss me
What
Now I'm so happy
What are you talking about
You used the Europe story
That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex
How do you know about that story
How do you know about that story
Hi
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story
I mean if you hadn't initiated it I-I-I know I would've
It was an amazing night
You think it looked amazing
I honestly didn't watch it
Yet
that-that may be weird
Good luck
Oh, oh there go the clothes
we look pretty good
That's what I was gonna say
Oh nice tan
I had just gone to the beach that weekend
Ah
Have you been working out
I have been working out
Ew
Oh that's not pretty
Oh
No
Oh God
Oh no
Oh, make it stop
Oh no
Make it stop
No
Have to make it stop
Hey
Hey how was dinner
Dinner was good
Okay
Now I'm gonna go
Sous is French for under
I sous stand
And umm, could you get me the pesto
Yeah
you made pesto
Yes I did
All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad
I like your necklace
I made it myself
You are so talented
Burning the midnight oil
So, where do you want to go
Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go
The Hard Rock Café
Yeah
Again
Did that guy just call you Toby
Yeah, he thinks that's my name
Well, why don't you correct him
And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby
Drake, I've discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss
What is it
It seems your body is rejecting Jessica's brain
Well that sounds simple enough, let's just do that
Well don't - What happened to Jessica's body
I'm not telling, you'll have to see it on TV
You don't know do you
No, couldn't care less
Hey good scene man
Hey you too
Uh-uh, Kash
Hi
Bye Kash
Bye
Hi
Oh, I can't wait to get sous-neath him
I have to fire him
But why
I paid to have this done
Hey
Hi
He said he thought you were charming
I thought I was a complete idiot
He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him
What did you say
I said no
What
Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant
This is back when I thought Kash was still people
Hey Bob
How's my pal Toby doing today
Was that Bob from six you were just talking too
Yeah
Oh then you know each other
We're on a semi-first name basis
What do you think of adding him to our team
Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes
They love him down on six
It's almost twice as hard up here
Bob will stay put
Hey
Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go
But
Gotcha
Okay, but you can't fire him today
Why not
Because I'm dumping him today
So now I'm not allowed to fire him
'Cause whoever goes second is the bitch
What do you mean
And the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired, blond bitch
Hey Toby, you got a sec
Hi
Hey
Interested
You wanna come
I got a date
A date
Is that weird for you
It's actually uh, a little dull
With who
I set her up with this actor on my show
You set her up
Hey
I-I hear you're going on a ferry tonight
Yeah
You ready to go
All right, I'll see you guys later
Have a great time you guys
Thank you
Hi
Listen, Tim you're a really great guy
I get enough of that from books
Books
All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it's like enough
Hey, if that's what you want to do I'm not gonna say no
What is going on
I have to find out how it went
Why
This guy could be my baby's stepfather
He's not you
I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening
What do you mean
Maybe fight over the science section
Maybe you can still have that
If anything that picture keeps moving further away
Smokin' body though
How much easier would it be if it were
I know, but I don't think that's what she wants
Who cares what the picture looks like
Yeah
Hey Toby
Hey Bobby
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is
Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here
Toby don't
Bob
Hey
What
I'm, I'm breaking up with you
You're fired
Why
I'm just not ready for a relationship right now
Tim wait
Yeah
There-there's a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again
Really
Yeah
'Cause I-I know I can do better
Hello
Hi
What happened
I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant
Ah, he didn't uh, take it so well
Well better than you, but y'know still not what you want
He sounds swell
Doesn't he
wanna a little cheering up
Yes
Sit down
I'm sorry about your date
Thanks sweetie
You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee
Oh no, I think I'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars
Hey, I thought I cheered you up
Oh you did, there are twenty in here
Good night
Yeah
From the wedding
Oh hi
Hi
how are you
I'm good except umm, you still owe me a dance
I think I might need one more cup of coffee
Uh, let me get it for ya
Hey you guys
What
Look, I'll come to the party but I'm not dressing up
You have to
Dressing up, pretending to be someone you're not
Yeah, I think I will
That hot girl from their wedding
So, what's new with you
I mean, I'm getting married next week
If umm, if you want to come, I guess that'd be okay
Really
You could be my sister for the day
Maybe I could meet the guy you're marrying
I'm supposed to be working right now, so who cares
Hi
You're supposed to wear a costume
Oh
Ahh
I'm Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you're too big for it
Trick or treat
Y'know, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts
So we meet again
So we do Supergirl
His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit
The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white
Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all
Hey
No, I-I'm not doody
Aren't you gonna give me a kiss
But right after you tell me who the hell you are
Ursula
Ursula's fiancée
Oh my God, you're the sister
Yeah
Okay, I just slapped my future sister-in-law's ass
Yeah
Maybe I can give her a little slap on the butt
My mother killed herself
I think I probably should go
Why are you looking at me like that
I love the second grade
Really
Y'know with all the politics and mind games
Y'know you don't have to stand here with me, believe me
I'm really - And I'm really-really excited for you and Ursula
I think she's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen
Yeah
You read comic books right
Exclusively
Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl
Catwoman, hands down
Really
It doesn't matter
What
You're getting a crush on your sister's fiancée
Trick or treat
Hey, can I write you a check
Okay
Okay, what's your name
Lelani Mayolanofavich
Hey Mona
Hi
He was hoping you'd come by as a slutty nurse
Umm, actually I'm just a nurse
You'd think that would embarrass me, but you see I'm maxed out
Hey
Hi
You made it
You're umm, you're a potato
Well, I'm a spud
Oh my God you're Spudnik
Two weeks ago
Oh really
Howdy doody
I cannot believe you didn't pick me
Hey, you guys could arm wrestle
Downtown
You are so sweet
Really
My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money
Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we've got candy
I'd rather have the money
Happy Halloween
Shut up
You can't tell me to shut up
Hi liar
Well they could be true
But they're not
Yeah, it's a fine line huh
Why are you lying to him
She's helped so many people to quit smoking
Y'know, we'd really better get going
Pride
My wife thinks I'm a wimp
And I'm dressed as doody
You're Spudnik
She's lying to you
Hey
Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying
Oh, I am just awful with children
Y'know, they're all greedy and hopped up on sugar
Look, I wanted to tell I'm-I'm sorry you lost
Yeah
Are you scared
Hey
Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this
Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again
No, it wasn't you
Well then who
Uh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control
Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose
And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges
Did she really say that
What's the matter
From the Halloween party, Ursula's fiancée
Wait, how'd you get this number
Oh, I have a friend who's a cop and he got it for me
What did he do
I'm talking
eats lunch
'Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister
Bye
Fight for me
Uhh, I won't take no for an answer
Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours
But wh-wh - How do you know where I live
Okay, bye
So apparently I'm available for lunch
I'm apartment hunting
That's not really porn
Not so much
Yeah that would really be great
Yeah
I mean if she just died this morning out of respect
Shall we
Yes
Verhoeven passing away and I'm so sorry for your loss
She didn't pass
What
My mother's still alive
Ahh
Y'know I would it's just painful
So she's really not dead
No, she's hanging in there
Where'd you get it
We just met
I told you
It's the perfect crime
She must've been planning this for years
I guess
snooping around her crotch
I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient
Hi
Come in, I'm so glad you're here
Not in the shaky angry way you are though
I had to give the engagement ring back
When I see her I get a little bit angry
No don't tear out your eyes
Sweet
All right, well finish your coffee; let's go
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available
Yeah, but when the baby comes she's gonna want to move
She is
Yeah, you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you
Nice jeans
What happened
Oh, I fell asleep
I was thinking about taking my lunch break
That'll really work up your appetite for lunch
Hello
What's going on
Hey
Hey
How was the game
I ate way too much
I mean it would disrupt your entire life
I just wish things didn't have to change
I do too a little bit
I have a massage appointment
I'll pay you
Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise
How come
Because I put my head between her legs
To see her pants
They're my pants
Did you see the stain
I was just getting into position and then everything went dark
Oh dear God
I recognize the strap
And yet you don't recognize that you're crazy
I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra
No
I would do it but she thinks I'm attracted to her
Why
We're in this together
I fear a jury will see it the same way
Come on, I catch you looking at woman's breasts all the time
How is she
Oh I don't know that it would
I don't know, I'm still pretty tired out from this afternoon
Why
Uh, the sex
What sex
Our sex
you had sex with Ursula
She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes
Well I was just so excited to see you
This is too weird
Brenda a bee
What
I think I know what's going on here
You gave them to me
No I didn't
Did you take my bra too
What bra
I'm loud
It's gonna be up all night
I'm up all night
It's gonna poop
Hello
I-I-I really want you to stay
I want me to stay too
I found it on the street
It's in such good condition
Yeah
Whoa-whoa what's under the covers
I don't know
It's moving
I think I'm gonna stay here
Huh
I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come
Yeah, he's kinda sexy
I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet
Why not
Oh well, I will be there
He's the stripper from your bachelorette party
Her what
Your secret bachelorette party
Y'know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition
It's a grand tradition
There was nothing I could do
Well you could've untied it with your hands
All I got was a stupid steak dinner
You went home with the waitress
Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night
How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken
Oh, I-I don't eat meat
It's chicken
He's right though, the '74 is absolute piss
I'm gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him
Umm, I got TiVo
What's TiVo
Are you really pregnant
That's true
So it was really cool seeing you lecture today
Yeah, a lot of my students do that
So, I gotta get going
Okay, I-I'll see you tonight
Yeah
You must be good in bed
How's it going
She's, she's so
Hot
I don't want to scare her off, y'know
Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what
I don't want you to get me a stripper
Will you let the lady talk
It'll make me feel so much better
I'm not a bachelor anymore
Just watch the hot woman get naked
But I'm only doing this for you
I'm seeing Mona again tonight
Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah
The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely
I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong
I just called a friend of mine
Yeah
What is it sweetie
What
I'm sorry daddy
I don't believe this
Please
Is that it
So you uh, nervous about getting married
What are you doing
Come on, it'll be fun
I can't believe tomorrow's the big day
Uh, that-that's-that's me
That was weird
Why-why would she go in the bedroom
So she's a
Uh that's an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta
So, you're more than just dinosaurs
I'm gonna kill you
Who did
Nothing
So you can spend your time with this tramp
Tramp
I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there
Getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny
I mean he was conveniently busy
Do you mind if I smoke in here
How could you have kept all of this from me
I was going to tell you, but
So, tonight's the night of the big bachelor party
Thanks for getting me that girl's number
So who's the party for
My husband
You hired your husband a hooker
She's a stripper
No, she's a hooker
Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes
When they're hookers
Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker
Why would she do that
Now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually
This is the worst bachelor party ever
What's taking you boys so long
All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave
Why me
It's your bachelor party
Which is why you should do it
You do it
You do it
I miss this
I don't think we've actually done this before
No, I-I miss hanging out with you
we still hang out
things are different
just-just us, y'know
She was there and now she's totally freaked out
I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her
Okay
Okay
Thank you
Thank you so much for coming back over
Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable
You're gonna have to tell me how you did that
Focus
But we are definitely not getting back together
How can I be sure on that
Oh we just - we drove each other crazy
Probably shouldn't touch me
Should I leave this open for you too
Wait
About an hour ago
I mean I was his thin friend
Turkey's are beautiful, intelligent animals
They're ugly and stupid and delicious
It's a lot of work
Or Friday with no two pizzas
But just - there's gonna be a ton left over
Hey
Happy Thanksgiving
You too
I have no idea
What
You like Green Bay
Hey
Happy Thanksgiving
You must've lost like
Throw it out
Hey
You look stunning
You're just - you're so fit
Oh
Is there a problem
It's just uh, God I hated her
Oh okay
Oh come on
You gotta save room, you've got almost an entire turkey to eat
Eatin' chips is like stretching
All right
Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full
From high school
It's good to see you man
Man, so-so what are you up to
I'm a commodities broker
Yeah that-that sounds interesting
But I'm rich and thin
Man I don't think I've seen you since uh, Lance Davis' graduation party
That was such a fun night
It would've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun
Yeah
Yeah
So what do you, what do you do now
Are-are you gonna be okay
I hate her
Okay, dinner's ready
Good game
Yeah
Solid effort
Will, right
Right
Oh I-I remember you
Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis' graduation party
You are unbelievable
Will
Do you-do you have a problem with me
Do I
You made my life miserable
I
Bring on the yams
But you-you've worked so hard
We had a club
No
We had a pact
It's not like it was binding forever
Yeah
The only reason I joined
Co-founded
Well, we did a little more than that
No-no
What else did you do
We started a rumor
What rumor
male and female reproductive parts
What
Everyone at our school heard it
It's not true
Yes
Could you also tell them I'm skinny now
Me too
It was like a million years ago
That's not totally true
What
It's true
No
When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman
She didn't look 50
Did she look 16
Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner
May she rest in peace
She put you on the map
As a romancer of the elderly
Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty
did still sparkle
Can't you just let this go
She's right
I mean we are having a baby together
You got her pregnant
Yeah
Are ya getting married
Those are my maternity pants
we're all very proud of you
Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now
Is there anything we can do for you
No just, nobody press on my stomach
Pie
Oh my God
I know
I'm gonna miss being able to afford food
They're mine
Yeah well, too bad we're gonna have to return them
They're gonna hear you
I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it
I have you
And-and I'm gonna play with you all the time
I'll see you later
Okay
Hi
I was talkin' to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren
It is a waste
I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors
Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you
I'm successful
Okay, so will you meet with her
Have her come by the office
T's
Yeah
Doesn't Ben go to the Smithfield Day School
Why
Sting has a son that goes there too
Yeah I know; he's in Ben's class
Sting's son, seven years old and there's a picture
The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools
So how well do you know Sting
Uh, I actually haven't even met him
If you get two I'll take you
Well actually, I'm picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he'll be there
Hey guys
They're beautiful
What
The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die
I haven't felt my feet in years
Well then get your money back and return them
Why not
Well it turns out that Ben and Sting's son do not get along
How come
Apparently, Sting's son made fun of the fact that Ben's moms are lesbinims
Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen
Sting says so himself
My little sister Dina
Hi Dina
Uh, there's-there's sales, which is great because you get to travel
supple leather lining
I-I don't-I don't think that I'm gonna wear the boots tonight
Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise
Thank you
Dina
He's real funny
You stay here
Wow
Now umm, the boy's name is Sting's son
Can, can I help you with something
Yes you can, I'm looking for Jack's parents
Are you with one of the students
Uh-huh, I'm with Ben
Are you one of Ben's mothers
It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents
I'm the new teacher here
Oh
I've only met your partner Carol
Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them
Oh, their number is on the contact sheet
Y'know, that party wasn't bad
That was a fun surprise
Maybe we should just walk
Oh no, we can't walk
Let's go
What's going on
These boots were a huge mistake
What
Maybe a piggy-back ride
Bobby
Do you Dina, take this man
No
Oh you'll take 'em
No I won't
You don't get a say in this
Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it
Well what am I supposed to do
And that they can make their own decisions
we kinda didn't use any
Hi
I'm Trudie
Uh-huh
You must be Ben's mum
Why else would I be here
I gather Jack and Ben haven't been getting along lately
Won't-won't Jack's father be joining us
Oh I'm sorry, Jack's father is not available
For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock
My husband's in concert
So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now
Are you here for tickets
Four would be great
I'm not giving concert tickets to someone who'd use their son like this
Do you need a break
Can you get a little closer so I can see the price
It'll cost you one husband
Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again
I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye
Maybe they have a plan
Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby
I knew you wouldn't be supportive
You're gonna ruin your life
Am I ruining my life
You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing
Excuse me
I just want you to be okay
Why can't you do that for me
'Cause you're my baby sister
I was scared of telling you
Not just by us
By his uncle too
Oo, where are the seats
Yeah
Yeah
Look at that guy by the window, wow
be completely honest, he's not that good in bed
This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right
Yeah
going crazy
So this has happened to you
in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy
sitting on Santa's lap
Holyfield from a Foot Locker
Ah
Yeah
Maybe she can give me a pill or something
Hi
I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center
ice skating
Okay, here's a good one of us
y'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow
So call me later
Uh sure, sure
Bye guys
Can you believe that
card
What-what is she crazy
And the Bing-ette
Honey, you remember my boss Doug right
Yes, hi
M

No leg-chewing for us sir

Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding
No
at our engagement party
Hi
What do you think
to say it to other people
I'm getting a hundred
not sure about the whole uh, card thing
Why not
we're really quite there yet
So, can I ask you a question
Yeah
Where are we
Huh
Where is this relationship going
Hmm
Let's do the card
What
I think we're there
I - But I think we should still have this conversation
Hi
Hi
Schiff will be seeing you
Yes, you are
So, how's it going
What do you do
I'm a doctor
Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend
Uh, I don't have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski
How amazing is this
So, are you experiencing any discomfort
I'm very comfortable
Any painful gas
Schiff what kind of question is that
Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table
Well would you like me to lie down on the table
I'm sorry, is there something going on here
Hi
So, how did your doctor's appointment go
middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple
Oh my God
Why did you do that
pregnancy
practically came on to me
You wish
Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you
Come and get it
Are you guys still together
You'll be getting our card
You and Mona are doing a holiday card together
have the conversation about where the relationship is going
Women
You asked me that
about it
Like asking her to move in with you
Smaller than that
Making her a mixed tape
Uh, bigger than that
Give her a key to your apartment
We were closer with the mixed tape
you
could say I looove spending time with you
No, we hate that
That is a slap in the face
We're all set for tonight, 8 o'clock
Tomorrow night then
Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either
Why not
botchy ball tournament
something
Well now-now you're just talking crazy
So why can't the three of us go out together

Can I choke ya
about-about where things are with us
Okay

I'm sorry, so umm, so where are we
Well, well to sum up, we're having fun, you look young
Okay
Really
Really
You gave her a key to your apartment
Hey

I'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape
What
Hi honey I'm home
From the tequila factory
I can breath through my mouth

Who was that
It's just the pizza place
I don't hang up on your friends
I'm sorry honey, I'm just having a, having a rough day
Oh, what's wrong
Oh you really, you really just don't want to hear about it
Then why did I ask
umm, erotically charged
Is that college talk for horny
Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon
Well, I gotta get up early and it's almost seven o'clock
Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too
You're my friend
Right back at ya
But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad
because I didn't ask you to do anything
Do you wanna do it
No
I was just testing you
That's the end of this conversation
This conversation never happened
Good night
I got you a present
Pac-Man machine
Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom
I kinda like it here
Do you really like it
This is like - Oh my, this is like my second favorite game
What was your first
Well I-I really don't remember the name of it
Well what did it do

A vending machine

Hey, y'know what
Huh
Why don't I take you out
with ya
I'll be fun
It's a stupid game
You only think it's stupid because you suck at it
You suck
then maybe I should just keep it
go home and wait for the thank you card
Why do you want to play this game so bad
game
I was startin' to feel faint so
Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman
Yeah, actually that's my roommate's
He sounds like a stand up guy

Hm-mmm
Freeman building is
Yeah, it's the new building on Avenue A
a graduate seminar there in ten minutes
Now the filet mignon, what comes with that
There's a side of steamed vegetables
I didn't pay you the rent check
We're on a date

Come on tell me your moves

And that works

Oh, you poor little famous man
I really almost did

So where'd you grow up
And so were-were you close to your parents
Yeah, not so much with my dad
Why not

Nice move
Huh
"Where'd you grow up," it's so simple
room
And now you're watching me walk away
Hey
You are not going to believe what I did today
Well it clearly wasn't showering or shaving
What is the matter with your hand
Because it's awesome
You think this is clever
is a bit of a challenge
Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty
It is when you put it together with that one
can't be there
He's seven; he's not stupid
Have you talked to him lately
All right, look I'm just gonna unplug it
Honey you-you got to beat your scores
With the claw
I am not gonna answer that
you had to, if you had to, who would you punch
wonderful time
much
Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before
Huh
I'm ripping into this swan
look irresistible
How do you do that
I put on shiny lip balm
Oh my God
you go
No, I don't want to tell you
Why not
you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there
phrase, "Get the hell out of my way
Well, why didn't you just take a cab
Rockefeller
Well you're not gonna be able to keep doing this
I already put it in my family newsletter
Wow
Hey
What is wrong with you
It's not like it's Citizen Kane
Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane
Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime
All right, let's do it tonight
Well don't you have that big date tonight
Yeah
After our date last night, did you feel a little weird
the lobster
Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster
Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night
Yeah me too, all night
You seem a little distracted
suddenly see them a different way
You mean like from behind
Yeah
Don't touch me
Don't touch her
But what is wrong with this dog
Cujo's throwin' himself at the windshield
What happened to your date
Oh uh, it didn't work out
Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me
Yeah
That's Cujo
Well, I left my guitar here again
Okay
Oh
Here you go
Okay
What
Exactly
You told me you hate massages
How long as this been going on
Well umm, Alexandra has been
I love you so much
What's going on
Come feel my belly
Will you please come feel this
Really
Oh my, oh my God
who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player
Mia Hamm
Maybe we can take it back
Where would we return it
How about to the street say from the balcony
Why don't we just find a place for it
How about in that cabinet
What is, what is in there
Feminine stuff
If you love me you-you'll let it go
Why won't you let me massage you
I've seen you naked
And when
Please
Okay, if it means that much to you
Dinosaurs
What happened
A dreamless sleep
And it's not weird is it
Ooohh
Why not
What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see
Or
Really
Come on
So
She's experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions, mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall
So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies
So but everything is normal
Absolutely
And-and there's no danger to her and the baby
I've never been more scared in all my life
But wait you said everything was gonna be okay
I'm not a doctor
I'm fine
You sure
Yeah, everything's fine
What happened
Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions
Thank God, most women don't even feel them
Okay, no uterus, no opinion
Oh you went to the movies by yourself
No I - Mona
Oh, I gotta go back in there
What's wrong
I just gotta go back
Don't worry about it, no big deal
There has got to be a way
That's a good idea
Hey
Hey
That massage felt so good
No-no, I got that
So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment
Okay but you should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour
Okay
I mean $500
What
600
What's going on
Oh my God, I'm never gonna get massaged again
Really
Come back and-and we'll work through it
Are you sure
Yes
I learned a new trick
What's going on
I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles
I shouldn't be the one making her throw up
It could happen to anyone
Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second
Yeah
What's up
Yeah
Maybe you two should live together
Do you not want me here
What is wrong with me
What do you think
Is it crazy
Well, I was due
I'll move in
Really
You weren't supposed to see this
You promise you won't tell anyone
Hey
Ohhh
Just relax
Ohh
Come on more
Oh God
Yeah, you like that don't you
Oh yeah right there
Yes
Yeah, but it's not a big deal
Like how you can't sleep
Wow that was a big one
Oh hey
Hi
Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates
Okay, good
Well he's tall
Uh-huh
He has brown hair
Of course, of course
A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe
He works with food
Older
Obviously, and he's British
Oh, I was just gonna ask
And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident
Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet
Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about
Hey
Then he'd be the stepfather of my child
He's not
He's talking about moving to Vermont
And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend
Okay, I'll talk to him
Hi
So, what have you guys been doing
What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place
What is this, 1985
So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like
And there's this great little place, Alessandro's
That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there
You're kidding me
No
Um, anyone want any
What are you doing
So
I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife
Hey
Hey
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it
No, I don't want to hit you
Kick me
I don't
You're in love with her
Yeah, I thought you knew that
Umm, no
I think you need to tell her how you feel
Okay that's the green stuff talkin'
But what if uh - and I'm not saying she will be - But
then my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way
Are you sure
So
Hey thanks
So when do you think you're gonna talk to her
What should I say
That's some pretty smelly work, huh Don
Excuse me
You must smell a lot of the time too
Is it made of cheese
But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible
I'm so sorry
What do we do
Okay what's up
What are we animals
So can you just make it quick
Wouldn't that be nice
I'll just be over here, browsing through the personals
You've been acting weird all afternoon
But good enough
What is with you
I'm sorry, did you say cheese
I don't believe in soul mates either
You don't
Some days we work really hard
you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house
Do you realize how hard that would be to clean
I love you
Wow, I wouldn't think Hobbs would like that so much
How long have we known each other
Wow
Uh-huh, long time
Yeah
We have a couple specials tonight
So you were saying
now here we are
Does it really matter
I don't want to lose
Ever
Is this your table
Yeah
God, you're gonna be here all night
I haven't even read them the specials yet
Hey
Well, at least you make each other laugh
Why is that bagel on the floor
Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation
Sure
Honey, you gotta talk to her
Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry
I didn't know you read tea leaves
And also tea tends to give me the trots
Uh-hmm, who's next
You mean your pink shirt
Faded salmon color
No, I-I haven't seen your pink shirt
I knew it
Well, I'm sure you get another one at Ann Taylor's
I love that shirt
Hi
Hi
I know it's tough now, but things will get better
Some cheese
Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD
In the James Taylor case
Y'know alphabetically or by genre
We really have to talk this through
I feel so terrible for you
Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else
big work problem
it's my boss
Yeah
Yeah, and umm my baby
Yeah
My boss wants to buy my baby
Oh my-oh my God
I know I told you, it's a really big problem
What he wants to buy your baby
Can you believe that
That's crazy
That's what I told him
Oh hello
We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately
Oh umm, I-I don't know if I want to wear a woman's shirt
We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack
The work problem
I mean it really felt like he was my friend again
What problem did you tell him you had
May I help you
It's as if someone really wants us to be together
Me
Well done
So, tell me a little bit about yourself
Oh okay, well I'm a masseuse, and I used to work at this place
Do you like to party
I-I-I like, I like parties
You're wild, aren't ya
Yeah I guess, a little
It's just that you have the most beautiful eyes
Oh stop it
Hmm
And you can just tell me about yourself
All right
Okay
I write erotic novels, for children
What
They're wildly unpopular
Oh my God
D
That really meant a lot
Let's just say I took care of it
Whoa-whoa-whoa, let's say more
What
I made that up
Why
So it wouldn't be awkward
And you couldn't think of anything else
I'm gonna get fired
Zelner
Oh God
Oh there it is
If I can meet a great guy, so can you
What
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee
Hi
What-what-what happened
Oh I'm sorry, you're kicking me out of my own living room
I was just trying to make things
I know
Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit
I miss that
You do
Yeah
Yeah
So, who's the guy
Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th
Yeah, I'd really like to
Okay, hopefully this time mom won't boo you
It's a dog
That's Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school
It's your parents' anniversary and you're going to talk about their dead pet
Hi
Hey
Hey
Aww that is so cool
And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly
What
Hey
Hi
Ha
Why don't all of you tell me a little about your self
Whose is this
He passed away years ago
So where's the party
It's in Massapequa
Interestingly Alec Baldwin was born in Massapequa
Yeah
And I've got the car keys
We're driving
Yeah
So uh, he seems like a nice guy
Yeah, yeah I like him a lot
Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab
Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom
That's a good question
we're so excited
And also, congratulations on your wedding
Wha - What
Which is why we've told them all that you're married
What
Thanks for going along with this
Dad so what we have to pretend that we're married
You can do this
Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan
Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding
Oh
We love marriage
Hey
I'll go with you
Did he ever let up
Were you guys making fun of Parker
That depends, how much did you hear
So, he a little enthusiastic, what's wrong with that
I feel terrible
I know
Open it
Yeah baby
So we never got to hear about your wedding
We were surprise that we weren't invited
It was a small wedding
I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular
I would love to see pictures
I want it to be amazing
You seem kind of quiet
Hm huh, yeah
Let me feed you one
No, that's not necessary
Please
No, actually I don't eat
I've never had one
Why don't you just try one
What are you doin'
And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns
That's a great story
Oh that is so sweet
Parker's a nice guy and I'd like to get to know him
Then you better do it now
Why
Because I'm going to kill him
What-what
Let's call a spade a spade this party stinks
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster
He's just such a great guy I'm so excited about him
There's nothing wrong with him he's a good guy
You think
Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative
I'm a sunny, positive person
Actually, you have a little bit of an edge
What's that now
Nothing
Oh look it's Parker
It's the bunny hop
Oooh I love it
You do
My God what a fantastically well lit hallway
Like a water and Valium
I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words
Oh thank God
A modern-day Eden in the midst
Let's try something else, let's play a game
Jenga
I lose, now Jenga
Oh my God
Is something wrong
They were just brake lights, Parker
Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam
You don't have to put a good spin on everything
I'm a positive person
Much less happy
But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem
It was really fun being married to you tonight
Yeah
That proposal, at the planetarium
I know, I know it was stupid
Did you just make that up
It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up
I will think about it
At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech
It was a beautiful speech
Oh, come on
Hi
Hey
Yeah you are baby
Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doin'
So did they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this
They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no
Why'd you say no
Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R
Please
I really appreciate you taking the time to do this
Can I get you anything
Umm, I'll have a cup of coffee
I'm gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything
Oh yeah, I'd actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea
Uh, double latte, extra foam
A mento
Right
Like the candy
Do you have some kind of fitness regime
We are pretty good at this
Yeah
But believe me, that's not gonna happen today
You're doing great
Yeah, so far nothing stupid
Mento
I just think you don't expect someone so hot to be so sweet
Well, it was nice meeting all of you
Yeah, you too
You too
Sorry
Don't worry about it
I've never lived like this before
Just a lot of close friends
How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base
Your address book
I think face to face
I would say that
Face to face, yeah
Okay, here I go
Great nap
I'm her sister
Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on
I'm okay
Yeah
She was pretty nice about that
You slept with her didn't you
Little bit, yeah
Did you just wink at me
Hey
Hey
So what's the final head count on my baby shower
About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do
Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it
I don't care, as long as my mom's here
Oh my God, your mother
Just go home and get ready
It's really important to me, I mean it's my mom
I know, what's her number
I'm-I'm so sorry
You wanna shoot some hoops
Oh cool
That's already your name
But the audition's in a couple hours and I don't even understand the game
Well do you want some help
You guys can be the contestants
Awesome
Bamboozled
What is the capital of Columbia
Bogota

That's good right
Hi
I'm so glad you could make it
She's still mad
It-it doesn't bother you
Such a sweet woman
What
I'm gonna come live with you
What
You have tears in your eyes
Uh, I'll take another question
Hold your breath
It's okay, I'm ready
No, fear of the number 13
Fear of Triscuts
This game makes no sense
I don't care
Bing
Either, it makes no difference
Choose, you jackass
I'll take a card
What
Why did you invite my mother
For how long
I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me
She can't hear you
This cannot happen
It's time to open the presents
Mom that's okay that you didn't get you a gift
Eight weeks of me
I can handle this
Remember Twinkles
It's kinda falling apart here
Oh look
Wow
Darling, that's a breast pump
What's this
It's a diaper genie
Oh, it dispenses clean diapers
Oh you're gonna do that ten times a day
Indian food
Treasure of the Sierra Madre

Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round
Is there a hopping bonus
Who invented bifocals
Ben Franklin
Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest
Queen Victoria
But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus
I'd like a Google Card
Nooo
Yeah
So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you
Of course I am
Where are you going
I'm going to the bathroom
Not if you were here
It looks like we got a lot of good stuff
She's going to live with us for eight weeks
Wayne Gretzky
No wheel, no cards
What - Why
Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn't follow it
You're in Paradise Pond
It's basically just a simple question and answer game now
we don't have a garage
I meant garbage
I don't know anything
I'm-I'm sure that's not true
Do I know anything about babies
No, not a thing
It's frightening
You do have another child
Yeah
And more than that I want to do all those things
Well then you really don't need me to live with you
Yes, you're gonna be so missed
I hope you're going somewhere with this
I-I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother
Really
Really
Spiteful
I'm so proud of you
I'm proud of me too
You should be
Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink
You sure
Uh, put your elbow in it
How do you put a baby down for a nap
Check if it's wet, check if it's hungry, burp it
Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card
But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know
What about the rest of Manhattan
Yeah, they all know
Oh my God, this is horrible
I'm so sorry
I'm so humiliated
I didn't write it
Am I really - Am I awful
No
I am freaking out
Are ya
My due date is in one week
What are you doing up
That is seven days
It's funny you should mention diapers
I'm serious
Okay
I have a job interview I have to get ready for
I thought you already have a job
How do you know how to do that
Oh
Oh
Oh, okay
I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items
Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple
I chose those, I'm a paleontologist
That is so cool
I mean it-it sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not
Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book
I-I teach it in my class
Oh, how did baby shopping go
A whore
Well did she know you two weren't married
Yeah
You didn't see how brazen she was
Sounds like you're a little jealous
Its a lot more money and I'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring
Wait, I think I know someone who does that
I'm little nervous
You really - You look great
Yeah, just don't get your hopes up
Why not
Well, the interview
What about it
Oh you don't know
Are you serious
" I was like, shhh
What is it that I do
I don't see any reason why I would do that to myself again
I can
Big commission; picked up a daddy
Are you okay with this
Yeah please, you guys have fun
It was nice to see you
And you look fantastic, although you missed a button
Oh umm, actually I umm
I really come off that badly
Good, because I'm sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks
How long before you have to leave
An hour
Hi
Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack
And the cream
Cheese makes me thirsty
Let's move on
Well, hats off to the chef
Umm, hats off to who now
The chef
I don't shy away from delegating
Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way
Hardest thing I've ever done in my life
You're ready
Really
Just fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great
I'm so proud of you
I think you should give him your star
He doesn't even know what he's doing
If you're a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking
Yeah
I love that place
You do
As a person you're a little
Oh, I'm totally crazy, but you-you like the food
I'm having fun
You must've had your hands full
That I did
We can go into detail
Poo
There's a crazy guy out in the hall
Hey
You're back from your date
How are you
What's important is how was she
We, we just had coffee
Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table
Do you not, do you not like Katie
I mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't
Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today
It's just that, Kate bothered me
What was wrong with her
She was perfectly lovely
Okay, so what's the matter
I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel
Okay
What
I'll uh, I'll be here, with you, all the time
But I'm being so unreasonable
Just one thing umm
Uh-huh
Oh no-no-no-no, no
Yeah
Want to feel good about yourself
What the hell
It looks really violent
I'm unsuitable for children
Now I cannot wait to see this
Yeah, yeah, it's already generating Oscar buzz
Are we gonna take a limo
Why not
Did you have the baby yet
'Cause I'll do it
What are you doing here so early
If they don't want me there, I'll just hang out with you guys
You told me I can have six tickets
You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372
You said you didn't want to go
Just because I'm pregnant you think I'm invisible
You snooze you lose
I haven't seen this dress
You really want to take me
Even, even when I didn't believe in myself
I'm so proud of you
She gotta have it today, right
I-I think it's still gonna be a while
I'll bet you that she'll have it by this time tomorrow
You're on
Okay, how much
One hundred thousand dollars
How about fifty bucks
How do I look
A little tall
Now, I forget, do you like to lose
Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow
You're on
The doctor's keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry
For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable
Yeah
Can I ask you something
Uh-huh
When Carol was pregnant with Ben
Mmm
were you this irritating
Wow
Excuse me
I'm not trying to irritate you
Well then you just must have a natural talent for it
She has the drugs
So, eight days late huh
Yeah
You must be a little uncomfortable
Eh, just a tad
If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along
Do them
Well, we are ready to try anything
Okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink
Okay
You can take some caster oil, there's eating spicy foods
We will do all of those
Top notch
You really liked it
Oh-ho-ho, yeah
Which part exactly
Can we go
Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part
Did-did you like that part
Hey
Hey
Hi
Any news on when the baby will come
But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor
I mean, I think you should do it
It's sex
Do it, get yours
I just want the baby to be born today
Why today
I'll take that bet
What
I might as well make some money out it
Can I get some of that action
Now I'm betting against all three of you
I really do feel like tomorrow's the day
Sleeping beauty
Okay, so how much do I owe you
What
Give me a number, I don't want to owe you anything
You don't owe me anything, I don't want you money
Right, how much were those
I don't know, five hundred dollars
What else
Do you want a calculator
All right, what else
Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes
Yes, money well spent
Rent
Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food
It's doctor recommended
What are you a girl
Always a great way to get in a man's pants
Come on wuss, make love to me
Y'know what
What
Oh, I know
I think my water just broke
You got the keys
Okay
Hey
Yeah
Not so much
Two hundred
Thank you
I don't care when the baby comes, no more betting
How are you doing
How-how the hell did you beat us here
Did you guys walk
Hi
You made it
Yeah
Give her some money
I really think they're out of rooms
Would you like to see a semi-private room
It'll be a while
Oh, okay
I'll be back in an hour to check you again
Thank you very much
I'm here to ruin this magical day for you
Oh no-no, not at all
Don't worry about it
Marc Coreger, this is my wife Julie
Hi Julie
How are you
Is this your first
Yeah it is
So, if you have questions or you need anything at all, just holler
That's so sweet
Yeah
We're all in this together
And I think we're gonna have some fun
Yeah
What
Here comes another contraction
Okay, just breathe
Hey, you wanna see something
What
Honey
I've been thinking about it too, and I, I think we're ready
You-you-you think we're ready to have a baby now
Oh, this is fun
My boy's all grown up
The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam
Oh, that's very - Really very-very okay
Thank you
Oh wait no
Later
I-I wished you'd called first
Oh that's all right, I'm coming back later with your father
Oh good
I actually needed to talk to you before the birth
Thank you
Just hear me out
We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant, okay
A child should have a family
I'm sorry
Hi
Oh hi dear
Okay
It just seems that you two belong together
New people
What happened to the Disgustingtons
So uh, how are the new people
Contraction
Okay
Ow
Are you looking at her
No
Don't you look at her you sick bastard
I wasn't looking at her
You miss your girlfriend
What
Since when are you so crazy about babies
I'm crazy about us
What
We're really good
We are pretty good
But nothing has to happen until your ready
I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right
We're not ready to have a kid now
What
This is going to be fun
Okay, hold on a sec
Period math
Yeah
Yeah
Now
Right here
Maybe here
Come on
All right, I'll see you downstairs then
All right
All right
Hi
Hi

Car accident
Oh

I think I know who you're talking about
Okay, what room number is he in

A doctor at this hospital
Now do you want this man's blood on your head
Hands
He's a patient of mine, I've been treating him for years
He's in room 816
Go get him
People tell doctors everything
Nine

Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you
Wells
Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me
Wells is a woman
All right, full name
Clifford Burnett
Date of birth
November 16th, 1968
Age
Can't you figure that out based on my date of birth
I'm a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician
I'm 33
And uh, are you married
No
So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues
Well uh if you must know I'm a widower
I'm-I'm really sorry
Yeah
Do you sleep with women and never call them again
No
And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y'know, sexually
Go get back on that case honey
I don't think the next patient is very far along
believe this
Oh
Oh there you go
I get it
Congratulations you two, I didn't even know you got married
Oh we-we didn't
We
What
We're-we're just having this baby together but uh, uh that's all
Why
What else
Uh, well he's 33
Ah-uh
A widower
Oh
We could, or we can have sex in it
Hey
Hey
Hi
Oh hi
How are you doing
Who's the unwitting human who's essence you've stolen
This is yours
Why doesn't she want to come out
Twenty-one hours, you're a hero
Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room
What
That's the doctor who was in my room before
Perkazet
You know him
A lot better than I'm coming off right now
And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy
Can we just, can we just start over
I don't think so
And I don't know about you but that doesn't happen to me a lot
It doesn't happen to me either
4
3-2-1 oh
Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds
I can't push anymore, I can't
Sweetie you're doing great
Oh God twenty seconds my ass
" Oh my God what
What is that
It's the baby's buttock, she's breech
Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads
Is she gonna be okay
Push
I'm sorry, I can't
Yes you can
I can't
Let's go
Here we go
She's coming
Oh God
They're just-they're just wrapping her up
Well be careful with her, she's really tiny
Do we have a name yet
No, not yet
Can we come in
Oh, come in
Hi
There she is
What's the matter
Sorry, I just can't stop crying
What's the matter now
So, do you know what you're gonna call her yet
I thought that was so original
Uh actually, we-we've narrowed it down to two names
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella
Umm, Delilah
Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore
So I guess we're back to uh, Baby Girl
Yay
Well what are we going to do
You do
Yeah, I've had them picked out since I was fourteen
Oh no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn't it
What are they
If it's a boy it's Daniel
And if it's a girl
I don't want to say
We're not gonna want it
Take it
That was amazing
Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby
Just raising her all alone
New Boobs
Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law
No
I'm gonna leave the three of you alone
Huh
That was some-something huh
it's complicated okay
I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it
Nothing
Hey
Right
Yeah, I guess so
Pretty dumb huh
Sure
No
What
I've been practicing my magic tricks
He pulled a quarter out of my ear
Hey, where's uh, where's mom
She went to pick up Aunt Liddy
About what
Isn't she beautiful
Look at her, my first grandchild
Wow, you could've done that with us there
When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys
Sure
Dude I just did something terrible
I thought it was Jack
Why does she think that
Because it kinda looked like I did
Again, what
Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand
As we all are at some point during the day
And he was gonna propose
I guess
You know how much he loves to propose
I know it's awful
Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him
Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything
I want a baby
I need to be facing the other way
Y'know you really should see someone about that
Hey
Hi
Are you all right
I think I just got engaged
He did it
did you know he was gonna ask me
I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group
The puppet master gets tired people
It just doesn't feel right
You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so
There he goes, your fiancée
I guess so
Although he does play with himself in his sleep
Dad, what are you doing
It can't be me, I'm standing right here
Wanna peek
No
Hey uh, is it okay to come in
Hey
Are you ready to try nursing again
Just open up and put it in your mouth
Dear Lord
I'm sorry honey, what were you saying
Wait up
Hi
What
I didn't propose
I didn't give her that ring
Really
No
So whose ring is it
It's mine
Is it an engagement ring
Yes
But you didn't give it to her
No
But you were going to propose
No
Huh, I might be losing interest in this
things up again
Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment
Look, we can't stay in here forever
I can still call you that right
It was a simpler time
The truth is, Dad, we're-we're trying
What
Well, that's okay dad, we-we can wait until later
Aren't you ovulating
Daddy
That's how I got my bad hip
Hey
I need to tell you something
Days of Our Lives, thank you very much
You can't marry him
And he's such a sweet guy and he loves me so much
Well do you love him
Sure
Sure
Yeah, I mean whatever
And what did it look like
I don't want to hurt her
Hey
Hey
I heard about the engagement
Surprised
I didn't propose to you
I know
I don't think you do
I can come back
No
Yes you did
Actually, technically, I didn't
Well then why did you give me a ring
you gave her the ring
No, and I did not ask her to marry me
Yes, you did
No, I didn't
Yes, you did
No, I didn't
And don't you say, "No, I didn't
Ahhh
He got down on one knee and proposed
You were down on one knee
I didn't propose
Then what did happen
Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me
No, I didn't
Yes, you did
What
You were gonna propose to me
I proposed
No, you didn't
Why don't we give this another try
I can't believe you're not going to propose
Hey, I'm not going to rush into anything
Oh my God
What
I'll come back for her later
Oh wow, this feels weird
Good weird
Wonderful weird
And uh, I'm sorry about everything
She's perfect
We're so lucky
I've been feeling
I've feeling
then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again
Yeah, maybe
Not matter what I did I couldn't fall asleep
Oh you guys thanks for doing this
He's downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab
Is he still mad at us
I mean, I just had his baby
I can't do that
Oh great, the pacifiers
In the closet
The burping clogs
Linen closet
The diapers
In the hospital
Fancy
Sure what kind
What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t
deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin
Blueberry
Blueberry it is
Thanks
Wow, he's really not letting this go, is he
I actually miss her
that's her
I can say I told you so but she's kinda doing that for me
Breaks your heart doesn't it
Yep
Yeah, I'm not so sure
Diapers huh
Yep, can you believe it
Give me the bag
You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me
I'm not gonna hit you
I can see it in your eyes
No I don't
A little bit
No
Little bit
Give me the bag
No, hit me
Give me the bag
You ducked
It was a reflex
What is the matter with you
Why didn't you duck
Try feeding her again
I already fed her
I know, that's why I said again
Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma
Who says that
People who've never ever been to Paris
Excuse me
Hey, so how is it
It's pretty, Okay date of birth
You know my birthday
tember
October 18th
Dinosaurs
the drawing is not
Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while
just put roommate
I mean, you're gonna get together right
I don't think that we are
But you two were supposed to be together
Yeah that's what she said
So
So I don't wanna be just anybody
Wow
It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid
Really
Yeah
How long has she been crying
You guys, I'm doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try
I mean, that couldn't have been easy but you figured that out
Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby
You must be a fireball in bed
You are the official baby crier stopper
Yes I am
You're never leaving the apartment
Say what
Okay so listen I'm gonna go lay down
We just got her to go to sleep
Oh so there can't be any yelling
No
Okay
Hi
Oh my God
What
What
Monday
How long do you have to go for
They said it could be up to a year
There is nothing like the support of your loving   wife, huh
Maybe you forgot,   but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week
I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be   able to make it
We were gonna go see the Jets
You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this   group together
Really
Not you
I can't believe you guys are moving
I call their apartment
I'm not even sure   I can have caffeine
One cup of coffee   won't affect your milk
Look at you all grown up
Nah, she's gotta be hot
Hey, how about you   set me up with someone, and we double date
How is Friday
Oh good, really
Hey
I've got good news
You got out of the whole Tulsa thing
You can stay here and keep your job
I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that
I can't be away from you for that long
Really
I'm not insane
Well, what was it
What was his name
In fact, I think he's dead
Just the reaction I was hoping for
You didn't forget
So tell me some about my guy
No
What's his name
Mike
What's his last name
Is there no mystery left in romance anymore
Excuse me
I know what she's talking about
Her on the other hand, botched Botox
Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood   therapist
He saw a therapist
Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just   really freaked him out
What was it
MIKE
All you have to do is pretend to be Mike
I am Mike
So what are you up   to these days
Well, I'm a lawyer
Mike, 'attorney at law'
Actually, I just gave up my practice
I liked that better than the law   thing, so
Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to   Mike
I thought you thought he was still a lawyer
Hey
Hey
What are you doing
Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa
Find anything
Slim Pickings
Nothing, huh
They're   looking for someone to shovel mesquite
That is so cheesy
'So Cheesy' also has an opening
Maybe she'll know of something
Thanks doctor
Mike hit my mom with a car
No, I didn't
And now we're   friends again everything's great
Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'
That's why you look so familiar
What
What
What
Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry
I'll stay if you can tell me my name
How far outside
I think you should take the job
Really
Hey
Gettleman
He's a brilliant diagnostician
You've gotta go to an appropriate   doctor
'Ah look, it's my favorite patient
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer   in your touchy
Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security   blanket to college
That was a wall-hanging
Can   we talk
Sure
Apparently I'm not a funny   guy
Why did you go along with that
My name in Mike, and I do play piano
Prove it
There isn't a piano here
I play a little guitar myself
Really
Uhuh
What kind of music do you play
But right   now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers
Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could
Go ahead, ask me out
He's behind the elephant
Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books   too
Can I assume you are also   a single parent
I am a single parent
I mean, where are you gonna meet someone
Mommy, what's wrong with that man
Where have you been
Oh man
Promise to call me when you land
Big leaver with a stupid suitcase
I know
sure
oh umm Mike's picking me up for a date
Where's this going
Oh my god you're right
I'm sorry I didn't catch
yeah he has to stay in Tulsa this weekend
how do you know I have one of those
excuse me
I said I think you're hot and now I'm embarrassed
I'm Hayley
look I don't usually ask out women that I meet in   coffeehouses
I would love to go out with you
Do you   know how hard it is to meet a guy like that
Oh
but you did say it
Vicrum
Vicrum
I'm gonna go freshen up ok
but you know   guys do that
he was getting off   to a shark attack show
Nooooooooo
But you promised to love him no matter what
not if he gets his jollys to jaws
Eww are you talking about my bother
I don't think   she remembered sleeping with me
what, how do we know, we never slept with you
What
It's open
WHAT
that you had a six year long relationship with   a guy named Vicrum
WHY
I'll get it
How can you not remember me
What
How could you not remember that we slept together
When
I dunno
no it's not ringing any bells
that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer
Oh
ok I can't do this
uh huh
so you don't think I'm a total freak
Do you want me to fast   forward to something a little toothier
Or does it always   have to be sharks
What's going on
sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a   part of this
let ME be a part of this
angry sharks   turn you on
no they don't
then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF   a treat
When you came in I switched the channel,   I was just watching regular porn
really
But that's Halloween
So, so, is Mike coming to dinner
Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go
Oh, yay
Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift
We all haven't been together the six of us in such a long time
outfit that can't  contain my breasts
You smoked
Oh, what were the other two
And, you  know, I'm not going
She's great with kids
She is
That little fatso was  a terror
And you should
They're forty minutes late
I know, u-uch
I know we were coming here tonight, I ate  nothing all day
Yeah, yeah um, their arrival  is in the offing
We do have a table for two available, perhaps you would  be more comfortable
It's just that we do have some large parties waiting
I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking
You said that was sexy
I'm not gonna smoke  again
That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again
You forbid me
Mhmm
Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be
Oh yeah
Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking
Huh, and no cuddling
And no kissing your neck
Oh good, I hate it when you do that
is not home
Uch
And she has  the keys
You have to do  something - knock that door down
The baby's sleeping
What if she jumped out the bassinet
Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped
Please, just pull  yourself together, okay
Because if there's a window open, a bird  could fly in there
listen, listen
Hello
Hey
be willing to reconsider switching to a  smaller table
Maybe we should just eat now
Restaurant policy
That'll make a baby
I can't make luv to you while we're  fighting this way
But when you wanted to  have sex right after my uncle's funeral
Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived
So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world
Mean it
D'you want to
Yeah, let's celebrate life
So let's get going
After what just happened, I'm never leaving  her again
'Mommy, I'm a girl, take  me with you
You are welcome
Let's not talk
What
I am still so mad at you for smoking
It was just a couple of  cigarettes - no big deal
Oh, blablablabaybaybay
You tricked me to get me into bed
That's right, I got mine
Er - does not
Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend
Oh, they're both exclus
Both it is, thank you
I'll just wait to put your order in
What happened to you two
I'm so sorry
We got locked out of the apartment, we
Oh
He bruises like a peach
Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck
Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon
Son of a bitch
Wher-where have you been
Well, we had a little fight
manipulative  shrew
Uch, you see, I'm ovulating
Did have sex, right
Huh, nkay, I'm gonna  take off
Bye
Well, this is just us
Mhum
Do you want to give it  another try
So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you
Do, do you gonna do it now
How was everything, sir
The shrew in particular was exclusive
Honey, you're screaming
having that conversation
To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars
Is this cool, huh
So do you have any questions for us
Thank you
hadn't really thought of that
nothing
Damn it
I'll call the cab company
wow
How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike
Maybe he didn't give you a chance
And I said no
That had been your window
He's just, he's so irresistible
The scientist guy
Continue
What are you gonna do
You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong
Heeeeeey
Hey
I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right
I-I'm engaged actually
Oh
Her name is Deliah
she must need her diaper changed
Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out
Because, it's weird
Why
***I really can't hear what she says*** come here
You gotta be at least bi
is the funniest guy she's ever met
She actually said that
Am I crazy to be this upset
Being funny is your thing
Yeah
more beautiful than you did yesterday
Oh, wait, wait
oh
Yeah, I should have told you
well, yeah
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
well, are you happy with this guy
I am happy
go
is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do
In Minsk
Yeah
From the poem
It's bad
A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing
No
ergo
I think that's great
Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines
Hey
Thank you
That's like a woman wanting to be a
What's the end of that sentence
Yeah, so
Wow
Hey
Hey
You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey
Is he funnier than me
and limericks
Not knowing when to shut up
That's my thing
how many guys have your key
I was just saying goodbye to an old friend
Your lipstick's on his mouth
happen to wear the same shade
he's only in town for a couple of days
Did you uhm
No, no
kiss him
Don't point your finger at me
Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out
Oh, you're going to Minsk
Well, I might
It's just lovely there
If you want your key back, I totally understand
Who's up for puppets
I'm up for puppets
Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus
That was kind of rude
Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me
You know, he was just doing his job
com
After that, not so funny anymore
you gotta keep it smart, people
we're more than happy to give you good recommendation
Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings
Maybe it's something I can work on in the future
that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you
I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive
That must have been hard
like a real boy
It lets the boo-hoos out
Here come some more
And what's the one kind of boat that can never, ever sink
What kind
A friend-ship
You blow my mind
Oh, I gotta go
How much do I owe you
Twenty bucks
Hi
What do you guys know about investments
How come
I should probably do something with it
Do you have any ideas
They play golf together
Hi
They just gonna love you, just be yourself
They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue
Oh God, neither
It's gonna be fine

You went out with Wallis Pincer
Uh, he took the SAT's for me
I knew you didn't get a 1400
I mean

Hi
She's so nervous, it's so sweet
Choked on his own moustache
It's got a great view of Central Pa

We're definately not a couple
Okay, sorry
like my mom
Oh my God, you're RICH
It's so nice to finally meet you
Your home is lovely
It's actually three floors
Oh, try and stop me
This is not going well
Why don't you go talk to my dad
Still sure about me being myself
Or maybe just a little less pimp spit
I can see where Mike gets his good looks from
Well
You must work out all the time
Oh my God, are you okay
I recently had surgery
I'm so sorry
I just should check the stitches
Did you just hit my dad
I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents before
Look, why don't you go talk to my mom
listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight
Well, not at all
I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is
Thank you, I think so too
Because he's very respectful of women
Is he really
you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover
Hey dude, what's up
Don't judge me, I'm only human
Did you take that tape
Wouldn't you need to know what was on it
Who'm I'm married to
Some girl

Itsy Bitsy Spider

So fellas
Yeah

Shake it
Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down
Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our   wedding china today
Like if the Queen of England comes over
Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint
What if something gets broken, they're so expensive
What is the point of having them if we never use   them
Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen   comes over
Man those   horses can crap
What are you going to do
like I was some kind of idiot
Well you proved them wrong
Who is it
It's your favorite sister
Jill
Amy

Hair Straightener

I had a baby
Oh my God
But you are much cuter then that geeky guy   she used to date

I'll help you practice it
Thank you
"Pick up grandma at the airport"
God she is unbelievable
Stupid Thanksgiving
What happened
I swear, its almost not worth dating married   guys
Don't say that
We were going to have sushi
It'll be like   the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis
And I   would like them to bond
Hi
Hi, hey
Hi
You're on Days of Our Lives
Yeah
They must put a lot of makeup on you
Hi

Hey where's the baby
Oh we just put her down for a nap
If you guys died
Thank you   Amy
PHOE-BE

And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected   to the baby
Later in the day
Do you not trust me with a fancy plate
See   its a game, whoever gets that plate wins
I can't believe I won
Well actually
Actually what
What
No,  that that is not what we're saying
Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you
someone who can be firm and strict
Thats not how you see me, is it
I lie better then that, right
You disappeared after dinner
I mean, I'm not a strong   father figure and I never will be
You grow into it
And look everybody   knows it
at the fun parts and the hard   parts
You're grounded"
Can you hear me say "You're grounded"
You said that to me last week
You weren't at the   parade because you had a family emergency
Wasn't at the parade because   I had a family emergency
Ooh, what happened
My sister's   raccoon
What are you doing
Sorry about before
I   mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer
What carrer
I'm a decorator
I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear
Why can't you ever be supportive
You do it
ooh oooh
Do you want to know why you don't want  me to have   the baby
uh huh
you have   always been jealous of me
Your total disregard of other people's feelings
I mean, do   you even realize how much that hurt me
Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him
Get over it
I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here   today
Too far
You take that back
No
Take it back
Make me
So do I
I do pilates
I do yoga
Put the plates in the   boxes
Did you just push me
Shouldn't we stop this
I want you to apologize   to her right now
I'm sorry
Mon, I'm so sorry
Now I want you to both apologize   to each other and mean it
Sorry
By the way, that fight was totally arousing
Are you okay Mon
Its not like somebody died
if it really means that much to you
So you're going to give me the baby
I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren   discount
Nope
Broke them all, huh
Yep
Okay, what have we always wanted to do together
Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach
courtside
Oh my God
He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night
"  So, if you could just realize it on your own
He's really looking forward to this
Tell him that what little time we have is precious
Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good
And thank you for watching the baby, by the way
Yeah
I didn't know you guys hung out
I mean, what are you guys going to talk about
Hi
Bye
I got bottled breast milk
Yeah
So, you're a paleontologist, right
Yeah
Hi
Hey
What do you think
So
How come the door's locked
So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa
So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction
You might want to keep practicing
Dude, come home
Why
HOME
What's going on
Wait
I'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out
Is that really necessary
little thing
What happened
eye-contact
Eye-contact
Mm-hmm
Let's send them mashed potatoes
That's going to make them think they can come over here
What if they do
I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair
I'll go down the fire escape
Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape
I'm just going to wait for a little while
Scary pigeon's back
Looks like a potato
"Spuds" is your grandmother
That's my bubby
I, I have a boyfriend
It's no big deal
What is your situation
But um
I'll give you a call later tonight
Great
move on with my life
Do I have to decide right now
So soon
Well, yeah
Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer
Ah, you mean lager
I just left
Well, you have to go back in
So, you have to intercept all his calls
Hey buddy
Uh, hi
Fascinating isn't it
What's going on
We shouldn't have lied to you
What
I want you to
You're gonna be okay
You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the art of seduction
Okay, bye
And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid
Oh
So, what did you guys do
Just his mom
30
Yeah
Did you guys have a good time
I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas
If I don't get it done, I'll be fired
It's so unfair, you don't even like your job
So, who does
Oh, I like my job
I *love* my job
Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work
I can't get *enough* dinosaurs
I'm sorry, I won't be here
Did I not mention that
Hey
Hey
This work sucks
*Now* it feels like Christmas
You can come to my house
Haha, no thanks
That was a nice pep-talk
actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker
So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing
That's terrible
No-no, we do it every year
Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible
Oh no, we have to
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too
Well then, you should look with us
Why
If I help, we can find 'em faster
Ooh ooh, we have a live one
Oh
I don't even have a car
Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas
Uh-huh
Sweet-tooth
You got me a cola drink
Cool
Yeah
What are you doing here, Santa
turtle-man
Remember
Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave
Why
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it
Really
Yeah, is that okay
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa
I couldn't leave you alone
Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys
Is everybody working really hard
Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy
-- That sounds like a girl's name
not tell you about her
Where is everybody else
I sent them home
Is she pretty
I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague
What does she do there
just below me
She did WHAT
BE-LOW me
Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma
*What*
Honey, there's really nothing to worry about
Okay
I'm serious
Okay
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
I'm *happily* married
- What's *that* like
So, I'm sorry
happy
I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight
Well, not anymore
But we don't do that
I know, I just thought it would be fun
How drunk are you
What
This doesn't feel weird
I know
Hm-hmm
You are really fast
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you
We're gonna see each other naked
Yep
Do you wanna do it at the same time
Count of three
One
Two
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined
I am *so* bad at this
I think you're better than you think you are
That'll work
I don't think so
That's stealing
I mean, you work, you work really hard for that
Ehh
Eh, you work for that
I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding
You do
We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college
You thought about that
Yeah
How many kids were we gonna have
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy
What else did you think about
Sure you do
I want a marriage
You sure
Uh-hmm
You're not gonna return it
Oh wow, it's so beautiful
"Wendy" is a fat girl name
Aren't we done with that
Oh my god
Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle
What are you doing here
I missed you so much
I never want to leave you again
But I thought if you left, you get fired
Because I quit
What
What, you, you really quit your job
Oh my god
I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it
No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great
I can't return this
Besides, this gift still says I love you guys
Mine's is to Lilian Myers
Hey
You're gonna get me good and pregnant
I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life
Well, I just lost my erection
I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself
It's exciting
I don't know where to start
There could be folders and files
I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash
If you want I could loan you some money
Wanna be an extra on my show
You could do that
Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV
Doesn't she look cute
How long was I in there
Advertising
That's a great idea
Don't you want to look through the rest
Sorry you had to waste all this time, though
Ooh, now I get to use my shredder
Because who can get a water melon in your mouth
Because your family's feet deserve the best
Leave it to the pros
Give me the phone
who have phones
Almost everybody knew that she was a girl
Who the hell are you
I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job
Excuse me
I'm a nurse
So, are you excited about your scene
But I'm a little shaky and nervous
Cut
I'm just a little nervous
Well, don't be
So, do you have any other question about advertising
I actually think we might have something for you at the agency
That's great
It's an unpaid internship
When you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid
I can just picture her on the bed right now
Stop
What do you mean, you're taking over my job
Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job
Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island
Can you please, please take care of it for me
Alright, but you have to do one sometime
Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together
You're very cheeky for a temp
I was transferred here from another department
The Jerk department
Oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit
Super Gavin
Incidentally, when are you coming back
Today
You said two weeks
Hey
I'm not an actor
Yes, doctor
Okay
Okay, let's try this one more time
Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming
The rest of the scene
I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even
We don't have a nanny
Can you please just take care of her for today
Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way
Huh
What do you feel like doing
We're gonna have sex
Maybe we can watch a movie or something
We're having sex whether you're here or not
Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Nsync
Hey, they were popular when I left
Why don't just let me take care of the presentation
Hey
Hey
You're not pregnant
What are you talking about
I faked it
Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe
It's okay
That's gonna confuse my fans
Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress
Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children
Nice
Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him
See, you and Drake are having a fight
About what
He slept with you and then never called you
And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky
Action
Me too
Me too
So ask me anything
Good, because it's in ten minutes
He's going helicopter shopping
You can do the presentation
No, I can't, I have a baby
I'll watch her
Why would you do that
Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy
That's really nice
Just let me talk to her
But this is her last chance
I have a process
You have a table with a hole in it
You're threatened
What
You couldn't have faked it
You just make the faces and the noises
Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby
Like a month
Or a year
I really wanna have a baby
Look, I'll just get my old job back
Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration
It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby
Where will all the ribbons go
Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind
Yes, please
I don't care if you are my brother
Hey
Hi
Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy
You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes
Oh, wow, Molly is just great
Yeah
Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny
You really think she's hot
How do you think she's doing
Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru
Lima
Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies
They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus
What are those
You have to get rid of it
OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob
Hello
I really owe you an appology
Is this your first appology
What
I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out
I didn't really see what happened below the ass area
Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep
I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag
But it was a deap meaningful relationship
Huh
It was Jones
Man, I wish I had a nanny like you
You mean, when you were a baby
Would you stop staring at her
I was leering
Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way
Just, she's off limits
What are you, a child
Hey Mikey
Hey P
What are you doing
Setting rat traps
To kill Bob
No, no, to test his neck strength
Better think of a new name for him
Oh my god, we killed Bob
Whazzup
Seriously dude, 3 years ago
You don't trust him
Because I could get a job any day now
Picturing that tree
For a walk
You mind if I join you
You know, I really need to organize my thoughts
Plural
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go
This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of
Great novels
Hi
Ready for your birthday lunch
Pleased to meet you
I can't stand that guy
You were just being so nice to him
Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit
That was so fake
I'm glad you're having a good time
Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me
Does he
What
These are my rat babies
We have rat babies now
Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party
So this is what a stroke feels like
Are you comparing my daughter to a rat
It takes a lot of hard work
So where did you study
Oh, I didn't go to college
No, where did you study acting
Hi, is Molly here
Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now
What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them
They're all brothers and sisters
They're Bob's favorites
It's gonna be ok
You must think I'm crazy
Hey
Should I help you clean up
Is everything alright
No, no way to recover
Look, I'll just give you this and go
Why
Why did you give me such a hard time
I do have feelings for you
You do
Hey
can we talk about what  happened here last night
I mean come on
you really don't know what I am talking about
No
" And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they  will"
talk to her
I mean if she wants to move on, that's  fine
You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it  and spits
Ah
Do you have any idea where  you're moving
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life
Is that weird for a guy
Well it depends
On
On how far along he's in the sex change process
Not that you need to,your eyebrows  are
You're freaking me out
Your knuckles are kinda hairy too
I have to get those done too
Talking about high maintenance
You dye your hair
I'm a woman
Double standards
Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar  tonight
Only if I don't have to get up and sing
So funny
It's just, I'm not good at singing
You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing
I must be growing up
While drinking
I'm there
I kissed Gavin last night
Oh my god
You kissed him
It was after the party, we were on the balcony  and
How did I missed  that
It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping  paper
is a scarf
So are you thinking of starting up something with this  guy
I could call in sick and not deal with it at all
Hi
I'm here for my eyebrow appointment
I'll take care of it
Do you get a lot of guys in here
Oh absolutely
Oh good
Are you looking to meet somebody
All right let's just do this
How's the moving on  going
The personal ad writes itself
Do you think you'll ever work again
Did she go out with him
I threw the message away
The high road
Hey come with me
Are you trying to get everybody divorced
I thought I had to make the jokes
Don't you have to be at work
Swoop
would you  rather drown or be burnt alive
we were just leaving
Who is it
I brought you some soup
Why
I heard you were sick
Hello Gavin
How are you feeling
I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick
Oh no no no
So I had fun last night
So did I
It's just a cold
Hum
He thought it would be  funny
But you said not to worry about
Just stay behind the curtain
Hi
Right, right, yes
Don't panic
What
I have a mace in my  purse
Gavin come out from behind  that curtain
It was my idea to stand  there
OK
I thought there was nothing going on between  you two
I used to be arodeo clown
I don't know, I'm sorry,  I'm just all over the place
Oh I'm sorry Gavin
It's just bad timing
rodeo clown
I'm not here to judge
Oh you have got to sing
No I told you I can't
But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice  voice
What have you heard me sing
All the time when you're cooking
What
Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in  my tummy"
I don't even know what I  would sing
Well I've got a book around
I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace
You already hit on me an hour ago
By drowning or
Why would he break up with me
I don't know sweetie
I mean, am I so unlovable
I can't sing in front of all these people
Could it be a faded rose from days gone  by
Can you totally see through her shirt
Bad day not to wear a bra
Hey, I need your help
It’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama
First of all, this is green
Oh my God
Did you see me out there
Every little bit of you
I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips
Sure
Mon', not that you didn’t sound good, but
That’s is the best gift ever
Public bathrooms  freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone doanything else
Uh-ah
Hi, there you are, I’ve been looking for you  everywhere
Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am
Oh, yeah, yeah that’s Michelle
Who
Oh, just this woman I’ve been seeing
You’ve being seeing someone
What are you taking amoxicillin for
I told you about my daughter
And done
You wanna see what it looks like
How you doing
Thank you so much
Yeah
And  make it bouncy
Oh you’ll probably take care of that on your hands
Honey, you’re just in time, I’m about to sing another  song
In front of all this people
And they love me
Oh my God
Yes, she gives the people what they want
Give in thistime and show me some  affection
Are those my wife’s nipples
I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have  let her go up again
I gotta stop this
"I am so excited
How long have you known her, likean hour
Actually about an hour and a half
I told you it wasn’t long, but there is an amazing connection  between us
Oh, I thought that was just me
Are you kidding
Hey, do you want to go away this weekend
I don’t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies
How do you know about that
A week
Ok, Michelle, it’s time to go
Well, call me
Ok
No, wait, you don’t have my phone number
Bye, bye
It was one kiss, one guy, one time
Oh, really
Yeah
Oh, really
Oh yeah
What about the guy from the bar
Who
The guy you gave your number to
Whoa, how do you know about that
And you didn’t even  have the courtesy to tell me
Why didn’t I get that message
What
From the guy in the bar, why didn’t I get that message
I never gave it to you
Why
I don’t know
Who are you to  decide what messages I should or should not get
Who am I
In fact this is the opposite of working
An maybe this, you know,Just doesn’t make sense  anymore
Hey
Ha, oh, of course
Thank you
Morning, roomie
You remembered to put clothes on this morning
But she did actually fall back to sleep,    so
She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did    last night
No, hey, it's been great
Yeah
Yeah, that'll do it
So, how are you
I'm, I'm okay
You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's    a divorce
Well, actually it
Wow, really
In fact, if you know anyone that would be good    for me
Sure, I know lots of girls
Any names come to mind
Hey
You want something
Why are they doing this
They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy
What is it, like two bites in    here
I just wish they'd realise they should be together
I may not have    kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name
But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom
Are we just gonna go ahead and set them    up with people
Hey
Hey
You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you
Oh my god
Wow
Yeah, I'm all set
Embrace your womanhood
Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume
Is that okay
Oh, it's perfect
Hey
Who is he
She's a teacher
A teacher
Oh my god, you're right
Yeah
She even reads for pleasure
How do you even know a woman like that
I went in to pee
I hear that's bad
Yeah, you know, it's not that fun
Wait, did you say until the sixth
Yeah
Today is the sixth
Yes, it's also 2003
I may have    also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant
Go take the test and see if we're okay
Tough crib
There's only one here
Someone average height,    dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle
Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy
Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me
Can I get you another glass of wine
I don't wanna be drunk when I go home    alone
Got stood up, huh
It's just a blind date
Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left
I'm still ovulating
Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not
So, let's do this
I - I don't think I can
We can't leave her alone
Sorry
I mean, how much can she even be aware    of at this age
canoodling in it
Canoodling
Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front    of the B-A-B-Y
I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't    so
Something people go to jail for
I guess you're right
Thank you
I'm kind of funny looking
What
That ain't    gonna happen
That's impressive
I silk-screen t-shirts now
What's that like
I do like my hair
How could you set me up with this creep
You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends
This guy is a nightmare
Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned
He's not stoned
Did he go out for a cigarette
She's asleep
Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can
The Chinese guy left
Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be
In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on    the house
Although I was hoping to    have sex tonight
Because you can't do that
Just get out of here, okay
What's - what's going on
You - you're making money off my misery
20, I am
You were loud, and I was fast
I think we may have really done it this time
Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test
No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry
Hey, did you stop by here
No
Where was she
Because you two were having sex
No, no, no
She will kill us
Unless
Why
Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family    name
Well, uh
Would you    like to make love to me
Really, really not
Doesn't work anyway
Hey, what's wrong
I just had a rough night
Crab cake
Eww
Well, what happened
Yeah
I did, too
Oh
But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up
Do you think she walked in, saw you and left
Uh-huh
How - how do I get them to name the next one after me
The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters
Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really    bonding
Run
Where
Can you believe they're still not here
What are the    chances
Can we have our free crab cakes now
Can this be right
What happened to all   our money
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays
finding gold
what can you make out of backing   soda and beer
we borrow some money from my parents
We're not borrowing money
Why not
but the other thing was never borrow money
I Had no idea you had this much pride
you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you
I put that tube top on as a joke
I'll go get the tube top
do you want to move in together
You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell   yeah
Yeah
Hey
And I think he would tell you it was a mistake
and some other bills
how much
Two thousand dollars
I soap opera star
Hi you guys
Hey
what's in the bag
So I went to the store and got some stuff   to baby-proof the apartment
" Huh
You're gonna do it
You don't think a woman can do this
And you can't do this
I found the hardware store all by myself
The hardware store is right down the street
/Great
she's not so cute
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
Okay, well you put down the toilet seat
Yes dear
Is that a bit you guys do
we're playing you two
Tell her we don't do that
Yes dear
I'm happy for you guys
Load up the Volvo I want to be a   soccer mom
You ready to go
You bet roomy
groomy
Hey
Yeah, I know
What do you mean you know
You know, I mean you're not working and   the economy is bad
I need to borrow some money
Kind of
Did she tell you we were having money problems
It wasn't because of your money problems,   it was for something for her
What
Excuse me
Boob job
That's crazy
Us living together, you're not   expecting a proposal, right
See where   it goes
For me it's as far as it can ever go
What do you mean
But I never want to get married   again
Wow
I kind of   lost faith in the whole idea
Was it really that bad
At one point near the end she deliberately defecated
Except for once in   the ocean
And I was totally wrong
I just never wanna get married again
Oh
maybe us moving in together   isn't the best idea
Trust me, I will never
Hi
So you gave in and decided to call someone
My perfectly proportioned wife
Don't look at me I never get his jokes
Thank you
single things
Do you want sex or did you do something bad
I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form
They're still   ok
And more   specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger
Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder
I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger
I mean, what brought that on
No you really think that's what it is
Hi
Hey
Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage
I really wanted to know how you feel about it
Why
Mike doesn't ever wanna get married
Never
Never
That marriage stinks
Get them married
That's not how you really feel is it
I love marriage
I'm sorry
It's ok that's how you feel
I mean you guys have   so much fun and you love Mike
I do love Mike
It's a big deal
Thanks
The Divorcer, to the rescue
It's not cooler
Honey
Yeah
I'm going to change
But honey you don't have to
I'm going to get bigger
I love your breasts the way they are
fascist
My ass is going to get bigger   too
your ass
Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too
do that
It's kind of a package deal
God why why would you want to do that to yourself
The Divorce-Force"
Better
Yeah, no, thanks you
I mean can you honestly   picture yourself in a Volvo
They are awfully boxy
normal
Hey hey, can I help
but these last three feet are where it gets   really tricky
they hurt
None at all
You don't want to get married either right
You wanna get married
Someday
But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before
And I love you, and   I wanted to live with you
Let's do that
I mean you might change your mind   about marriage
Are you gonna change yours
No
I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want
But I don't want this to end
I don't want it to end either
I guess I'll have my stuff packed   up
Ready to go
What are you doin'
You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to
Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless
remember Andrea Rich
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you
Bet she'd sleep with you now
I like him a normal amount
You feelin' better
Oh, I really miss Mike
You're not gonna need my help
If that's what you want
That was a test and you just failed
I respectfully disagree
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page
I don't have a page
Put down the scrunchy
What are you doing
That really isn't funny
Well, how you died was funny
Oh please, hit by a blimp
It kills over one americans every year
You're messing with people's feelings here
God, I wish Mike were here
It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon
Here
This is your cellphone
Yes
This is your current cellphone
Give it to me
You can't have it
You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore
The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back
Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy
But he's the same
Yeah, I think she wants the old one back
Those are my shoes
How did you even call him
There is a speakerphone on the base unit
Thanks, you look good too
Keep it clean
So how's the piano playing going
I've missed you
No, come on, you know that's not true
And I'm dead
This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief
Original or crappy
Original
No, sorry haven't seen him
It does
I can't do it
you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child
What
Oh, crap
Who is this
Well, you are not doing a very good job
Excuse me
What's with the kissing
Hey, at least I knew where my guy was
Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing
You're just heartless
You're weak
weird
Damn it
I blame myself
I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class
take your coat
Who is he
I look like a man
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time
it's probably the way you stand
Kori Weston
Yeah
You look amazing
I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all
I always remembered him
Ok
Alright
I'd like to buy some tickets myself
No thank you
Hey will you get me tickets too
yeah thats a great idea
No thanks
Still on Amelia Earhart
boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker
You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade
Pie eating contest
You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something
Yes and you talked to her
I did
She dropped off a casserole
But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three
No that kid Nate got it
Pull up your pants
Yeah I know
Well, there's two spots left right
Alright, who wants to do it
I hope I win
you're both wishing for the same thing, right
won't come true
but we "know" what you're wishing for
Can't really say
Please, just do it
How are you gonna feel if we actually do win
Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that
"Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm"
Why would I eat my own arm
I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you
Get a room
Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win
I don't know, probably just invest it
Calm down
We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks
I don't really care about the Knicks
You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go
I can't believe you're taking this away from me
Which I now realize we are not
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word
But hey, there's one spot left, right
Well no, Charlie's gonna get that
You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job
Ooh, I have another idea
I'm sorry, idea time is over
Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl
Yeah
What about the ones you have on the nightstand
There are no tickets on the nightstand
You must be mistaken
The psychic also said that I would be betrayed
I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together
Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago
There's the man I married
If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us
NO
Don't come any closer
Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished
No, what's more important, your friends or money
My psychic said I  was gonna win, remember
shhh
Give me a call if you want
Oh God, I am so sorry honey
Sorry
It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work
Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren
No, she was just much better at job than me
We have 53"
I got that
Oh, we have one too
The Powerball is 7"
Wow
that's great
"gleba" is not a word
Oh, but of course it is
Okay, what does it mean
Yes you did, gleba is a word
Ok, use it in a sentence
No
We're offering you the position of junior copywriter
Me, that guy who just said butt cracks
Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you
Thanks, man
And I like to think I had a little something to do with it
What
Oh yeah
There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win
So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park
You guys, what was the Powerball number again
Seven
We won
What
We won
We all get 50 cents
You can have mine
Me too
Me too
I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good
Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again
Hey
Hey
Sure
I'd love to
We're booked solid for the next month
Try to recapture the magic
Can you get out of work
I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant
Are you really that busy
Just use your travel insurance
I don't have travel insurance
I mean, two guys in a romantic inn
He's so gorgeous
Also so gay
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"
We're ready for you
Oh, wish me luck
Get out
You don't love him
What do you know about love
I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge
That kiss never happened
get out
I don't have a choice
because I can't stop loving you
Everything was delicious
Thank you
Actually I do have one small complaint
I-I welcome criticism
it's kind of a mood-killer
Great
Yeah
You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but
But what
Bing, so where are you joining from
Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody
Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer
I'm sorry, it's not here
Not there
That's insane
I take six
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there
C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time
Dude, you're shaking
Hi
and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow
You wanna read lines with me
I can't believe you married him
He was keeping my sister in a dungeon
Everything we feel for each other
You have to accept that
What
No, I'm saying
USA Today
Nice, put it with the others
I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant
Oh, that's not cool
No, no, no, you can't take the remote control
Let's celebrate with some maple candy
No
Can I ask you a question
Yeah
Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams
Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him
I mean, that was pretty intense
What do you think brought than on
With who
So do you think that my dream means anything
I took two psych classes in college
You took the same class twice
My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant
Ok, we're still on that
I didn't say your songs were not good enough
Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food
it's not about quality
It's what some people sing in
Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay
What
There's something new in the bowl
Look, we have enough, just walk away
I want the pinecones
There's a forest right outside
It's not the same
Ok, you have to stop playing now
The only person my playing is bothering is you
Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner
Hey
I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right
What
how is it going with Drake
I don't think it's going very well
that scene I saw was so good
So
I've never played that
Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before
with you
Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play
I could fall asleep at a play
What is it
a bitter woman's journey through life"
You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise
Yeah
and not have it be a big deal
Why
Yeah
And what's the big deal, people do it all the time
Who do you know that are friends that just fool around
Don and Janet
Who, who are they
I know them from work
Both of them
No, one of them
Which one
Hey
Hey
Hey
I'm professor Wealer
Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice
Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us
I don't think so
You don't think we should wait for him
Hey
What's happenin'
a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people
How did you think you were gonna get away with that
I do it every year
You do that every year
Yeah
And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant
Yeah
But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people
Please, please, please
I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts
So basically all nuts
no
Oh my God
I've lost the will to live
Let's ditch him
What
Hi
Wh-what's wrong
and I think I might have it
other poultry
You're not sick
I heard you before, that is so not what this is
I thought you came to say you were sick
That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory
And that horrible museum tour
What party
go, go get yourself a drink or something
Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered
Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number
Nice to meet you
Call me
I just broke up with someeone
Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer
Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with
you dated Albert Wintermeyer
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man
I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him
Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize
for three years
no, no Nobel Prizes for him
Oh, What's the matter
Nice to meet you
So what show are you on
Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs
Gotcha
Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry
You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater
Tell me, tell me about your first period
No
Did somebody sign your bra
What is that, come on, a piece of paper
It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize
You're sweet, and kind, and funny
And sexy
Why don't you just kiss one of them
And I can't stop you
Oh, you're so wonderful
I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie
I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD
Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid
I mean
Hey
Hi
I'm gonna get some more coffee
those-those people are stupid, I hate those people
I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral
Yeah, I know the type
Where did you get them
Hey, what's this
She hates those corporate massage chains
I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting
Do you wanna go hunting
Oh
They're putting people like me out of business
It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks
the hollow shells
I don't care about any of that
Well, do you care about friendship
Fine, I won't use it
Promise
We really need to take those tests
Just a few routine tests
But I don't wanna do it in a cup
What is the big deal
Hi
Come on in, how are ya
I'm good
Can I offer you a drink
That would be so fun
Ok, what do you wanna see first
I know, yeah
And first, I have to see the MET
You wanna see the Yankees
No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular
Which one, they all suck
This has been torn up
taped back together
Ok well, I'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready
Ok
Through the glass doors
Sorry, everyone is booked
Then why you work here
Hi
I'm kind of having a little problem
Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious" means, just don't use it
She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo
Get to the problem
You gotta help me out
Thanks
Oh, you should take her to the MET
The Metsss
Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry baseball fans
Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET
Just go back to the MET, ok
Ok
You got to tell me exactly what to do there
Yeah, I guess
No one here even knows you
OH MY GOD
How great is this
Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home
Okay, then I'm Swedish
So, what's your name
Ikea
what an interesting name
we don't have time for this
Ok
Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy"
What does that mean
Did you make your deposit
The hard part is over
I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok
I have a friend who is a masseuse
and why do you think that is
maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar
You know it's me
Man, you can lie about Sweden
How can you come here
How could you not tell me you worked here
Tips not included
I don't have any
Hi
Hey, how was the Met
The museum was amazing
What do you mean
What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on
Plus he's hot
Hey
Actually it's both of us
What
Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, what
Cosmo
Yeah
Maybe you could take Charlie shopping
Oh, well
I'm sure you have better things to do
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help
Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him
Ok, that'll be great
The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together
That's not what we're gonna do
Hi
So, keep having sex on a regular basis
Hi
Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference
it's fun, yeah
Who's making the decisions
I've a meeting with him today
He's a pretty tough guy to impress
I think I know how to dazzle him
It's in Barbados
But you come first
How did it go at the fertility clinic
Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample
So-so what did the doctor say
too hard for her
So you're ruling out surrogacy
Yeah
So, I don't have to learn what that means
we're talking about sperm donors
I think what you want is over here
Really
Because I-I've seen them
You've seen all the movies
Sure
Ok
Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else
So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie
She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her
I mean, nobody else has a chance
Who else
It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous
I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal
Yeah
So can we keep this between us
Hi honey
Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work
I got it
Ok
It would be so bad if she heard
Which means that she heard it too
We have a problem
Just be honest with her
Oh my God
Is she there
What's up
I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker
How's it going
he fell asleep
But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda
Barbados
Well, just wake him up
Those eyes, those cheeckbones
Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay
You don't like him
we should get more information
You guys have such a great place here
do you have a history of mental illness in the family
Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout
Can we just talk about something else
Alright
Ravioli's delicious
Did you have braces as a child
Let's just go over there and see if she heard
Ok, listen, let me explain
It's like she's a nympho
Wow
Yeah
Because I'm really dreading going to this party
That's a very serious thing in my culture
And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk
Wow, you look unbelievable
What-what are you doing here
permanently
What happened
Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles
Yeah
Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done
How are you
Good, good, life is good
Good
Mike and I broke up
Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up
That's so not like us
Do you wanna get a drink
I'd love to
Do you smell beets
Is that Mike she's with
No, that's David
You're gonna let me go home, aren't you
You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer
I'll see you tomorrow
I think we've found our sperm
Does seem pretty perfect
he's not you
Yeah, he's better
him or anyone else
Are you sure
So you know this leaves us with
Adoption
How do you feel about that
Actually I think I feel really good about it
And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way
I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable
No you didn't
Really
I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures
So, we'll see you guys tomorrow
never happens
I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech
Sarah
Thank you so much
You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives"
I'm sorry, I don't own a TV
Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind"
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip
Who's Mike
boyfriend
a blast from the past
Ho-honest mistake
At least you took me down with you
That's-that's gonna go away, right
I guess, in time
Seriously, we're gonna do this
I-I'll propose to her
What
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point
Hey
Did you talk to him
Yeah
I thought we could hang out
Yeah
I will if you will
So you'll be ok
Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke
Thank God you guys are here
Hey what's going on
I hope you told him not to
Look, David is going to propose to you tonight
That's fantastic
Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer
Hey guys
The chocolates aren't here yet
It's fantastic
Actually the wet season is June to December
I think it erased your hard drive
What did you do
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it
Why, why would you open it
Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"
You have a hard copy, right
I don't
It's really gone
I just feel awful
You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work
Well, what do you do
play Tetris on somebody else's computer
What am I gonna say
We've got all night
That's, that's great
No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike
And there's not chance that will work
we can't do anything
We could read
Yeah, that's it
or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation
That's Ben, my son from my first marriage
Your first marriage
Yeah
Oh my God, this is so cool
Ok, odd thing to get excited about
She didn't get any fitter
"Oh, I knew all along"
"Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay"
Pharmacists are fun
What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like
There it is, you're blushing
No
It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen
Do ya
I had a great time
Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who
La
See you, bye
Bye
Good night
She's clearly in love with Mike
something I wanna say
Sure, ok, yeah
Oh my God, Mike
It's David, actually
What are you, what are you doing here
I have a question I need to ask you
I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself
Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say
Sorry David, but she really has to know this
I have a ring
Ha ha
Ok, I'm gonna take off
David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry
Just so I know, if I had asked first
The sun is out
Nooo
so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous
What
He said "erectus"
you're kidding, right
Erectus
Oh, thank you so much
Yeah, and so funny
You were incredible
Yeah
So, what are we gonna do today
I'm not always that bad
and
is it weird that it's not with each other
C'mon guys, it'll be fun
I'll play if we don't keep score
But then how do we know who wins
Nobody wins
SUPER
I'm not playing with you
Yeah, I'm out
Aww
You're ready to play
I though he was soft like you
Wanna make it more interesting
How much were you thinking
Ten bucks a game
Make it fifty
He-he-heads
My point
Charlie and I broke up
Nooooo, why
No, it's not, we have nothing in common
yeah, it's true
why do I keep going after the wrong girls
So
I'll see you later
for how long
Oh yes, of course, I remember him
this can't happen
no big deal
It's not a big deal
NO BIG DEAL
It's so not a big deal
Yeah
I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table
Do you
Ah, yeah
Do you
Ah, yeaaah
DO YOU
So everybody goes home a winner
Best out of three
That's what I'm thinking
I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus
I knew that was him
Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here
Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later
I've put in four hours
But
Well, this is my sickness
What about the obsessive cleaning
So you forfeit
No, you didn't
What
Because I'm gonna play for ya
You can't do that
I don't care which of them I beat
Whoever wins this point, wins
You're good
I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was
Why
I don't know
Now we can enter into doubles tournaments
Thanks
Hi
I don't think they saw us
we can't
You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired
I'll put a pillowcase over my head
Hey
What's up
Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid   walls
Sounds like he's with someone
I didn't even have to ask you   to call me that
giant
I'm not sure about this
This is none of our business
Someone get me a glass
What
ooh
No-one is manning that wall
I'm on it
Anything
I think I hear curtains closing
We've got shoes being kicked off over here
Bedsprings, unmistakable
Tomorrow morning,   before we leave, I'm going to the salon
*sigh*
Is everything okay
I don't think I can do this
He's gone
Miss Congeniality
Well, if you see him could you please tell   him I'm looking for him
No idea what it means
Hey
Have you guys been
He's gotta be here someplace
Pssst
Have you guys been listening this entire time
YE-AH
Now, what is this
Well, he's with Charlie now
The people that  care about you
Sure
Enunciate
Are they right
Yeah, we can wait, we don't have   to do anything tonight
six years
It's almost as long as highschool
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now
He's not thinking about you
No
I'm thinking about you
What's wrong
Nothing
What is it
What's wrong
Yeah
Hey
Hey
You guys ready to go
You're not taking your Bible
Besides, it's   a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it
I'm just gonna talk   to him on the plane
Stop it
PHD
Uh, actually I think she went to the salon
Check it out
aaaaaahhhh
What do you think
I think I can see your scalp
Don't you just love it
You got shellfish in your head
You go girlfriend
You've never said that in your life, have you
Not once
kinda weird that I'm sitting   next to Charlie after we broke up
Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care   about your social life
Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie
dude, I spent the whole conference   with Charlie
you feel free to roam about my cabin
You should be careful when checking your overhead bins,   'cause items may shift during
you're not good at this
You don't have to go home tonight, do you
It's Saturday, right
Oh
What
I can't do anything tonight
Why not
I have a date
With who
you and I broke up I started   seeing someone
For how long
Three months
I   promise
Pull out the   packing material
He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty   free"
I think now would be a really   good time to talk to him
Ooh
Still nervous
Yeah
Hey
Hey
kinda need to talk to you about Charlie
Yeah
,   well
I saw you
It's okay
What
I want you to be happy
Are you serious
Now I have something
I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know   that
before you
You are so loyal man, and selfless,   and generous
I am those things, yeah
I may have to rethink some   stuff
Dude
Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you
Thanks
So hi
We had a really good talk
That's great
Yeah
Oh, so everything's okay
He is an amazing   guy
Well, obviously I think so too
Well, I'm so excited about this
Excited
When we go back to New York, I will tell him
Hi, Mike's place
Hey, it's Mike
Ooh, that was fast
I
might be a picture of Precious   on my coffee table
Is she a purebreed or did you   pick her up at the pound
You go back to work tomorrow night, right
What are you singing
It's "Bolero" from "10"
I hate them
You said you liked them
I believe what I said was   that I could see your scalp
Everybody else does
Hit yourself in the tooth
Come here sweetie
What is it
Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo
You were saying
Okay, look it's about me and
Why do bad things happen to good people
I'm gonna take off
I mean, are you guys getting back together or something
Susie, can I call you Susie
My name is Precious
Why
Well, I don't
I mean, what's wrong   with me
Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you
I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now
Okay, not a fan of the tough love
I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any   warning
Is everything okay
I have a problem
Hey
Hi
Yeah, 'cause that's what we do
tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together
It just means that once again   we can't
I mean, we can   control ourselves, we're not animals
Seriously, good night
Stop saying good night
Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a   little something for me
Sure, what do you have in mind
I think you know
I don't really feel like it
This is what I want to do
Let me explain, okay
Shhh
One kiss
Anything
So you two are
Yeah
ed
No, no, no
No, no, no
But if I hadn't walked in here, would you
You have every right to go nuts
Do you see me go nuts
You know what   we should do
Calm ourselves
I'll cook
Hey guys
Hey
, 'cause he's meeting me here with   the triplets
Drink your hair
Hey, what's all this stuff
Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies
Oh, this one is so cute, get this one
That's not really how it works
Oh, how does it work
I'm sure they'd help   you
That's not what we talked about
Hey
Hey
Good to see you
Good to see you, too
Hi Frank
Hi, how you doin'
Which one is which again
Well, what would we be doing
Some champagne, fancy   dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home
Feel me up
Hey, Charlie
Hey
Dreading this
It's stuff you left at my apartment
Oh, thanks
And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you   want
Uh, actually, that's
Maybe   have a drink
Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute
Yeah
Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest   thing
I haven't slept in four years
I counted them when they were coming out   of my area
No
What
No, I can't
Because I   didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them
I just was thinking   that, you know, maybe you could take one
Oh, please, we're happy to help
We went through the same thing when we were adopting
I mean, you have a lovely home
Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us
It's pretty much all the information you need
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you
It's just so pretty and white
I would have told him to do it too
Hey, you must be Owen
Hey, I was in the scouts too
You were
Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother
Huh
You know how to use a compass
I have a badge in it
That's fantastic
You wanna see it
They're telling us all about how they adopted you
What
What
Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some
Just hangin'
And when are the fajitas gonna be ready
There's no weirdness, no tension
No awareness
You know, he   normally doesn't drink like this
Can't seriously be talking about me   taking one of your kids, can we
No, of course we're not
Insane
I know
Alice would never go for it, right
Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've   got her onboard
Which one would you be willing to give up
Huh
Jr
Like, the other day he made up this joke
What about Leslie
She's gonna be a doctor or a   realtor
I think we just ran out of kids
I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but   they're my babies
You   name the day, and I'll be there
How about tomorrow
You and Alice just take the whole day   together
You'd do that for us
Where are Bill and Colleen
Can you   believe how nice they are
We have to leave
What did you do in the bathroom
And there's a slight chance I may   have told him
Hey
Those are for Owen
By the way, you should know we   haven't told him he's adopted yet
I'm adopted
Intuitive
Where did you hear that
And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell
Which technically now you should give back
You told him he's adopted
"Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa   is real
Ooy
And what is   life without love
Oh my god, are we supposed to answer
Dude, are you okay
I - I have to take off
I'll call you in the morning, okay
Okay
Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me
I think we're gonna take off too
I mean, you probably just want to be alone
No, no, it's just that it's getting late
I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's   okay
Yeah, that's probably a good idea
I'll see you in the morning
Here you go
Did you stay here all night
Yeah
So you took off my pants and shoes
Because nothing is gonna happen
And clearly
Has it been that long
That's what I hear, yeah
I'm crazy about her
And she feels the same way
I think so
I mean, she didn't   see the dance, did she
Are you sure   about this
Yeah, I'm sure
Hey, Phoebs
Hey
What
It's actually our first official date
You're nervous
This is the part I'm actually good at
How can you be so confident
I know exactly what I'm gonna do
Like you have a routine
You have   to appreciate their uniqueness
Really
More foosball
Stop   staring at your sister's legs
how did you get so tan
She went on one of those spray-on tan places
So, do you get colours or just French tips
Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town
She's the worst
I know, and she's always bragging   about all the famous people she's met
All right, who hasn't
I don't   wanna see her
Ugh, Let's just cut her out
What
I like how you look, what are you
Puerto Rican
Two, I think a two
Got it
Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat
You sprayed my front twice
No, I barely even   got to three Mississippi
Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps   getting darker for the next four hours
So, how dark is it   gonna get
You got sprayed with two two'   s and
I'm a four
So
Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of   the couch
Okay
This is gonna be great
It could be Amanda
I   am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat
Your last name   is Buffo-Martisis
to assure you get this directly,   ring me back on my mobile
Why, why, why didn’t you just say no
And you would
Ok, yeah, got it
This thing welded shut
Okay
All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this   thing
Ow
Sorry
It’s a standard issue bra clasp
There is something different
I went to that tanning place your wife suggested
You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory   all by yourself
You didn't like that
He couldn't even undo my bra
Hey
Is Amanda here yet
Hi
Musty
I'm so happy you two are friends again
kinda
Oh My God
I feel like   a perfect arse
Got champagne
uh uh
Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it
You kneed me in my misters
You look   positively ghastly
You were really controlling and compulsive and   shrill
I'm still all those things
It's because I'm scrappy
Well, I know what's the matter with me
difficult
Hey
more   than that
you know, sneaking around, having to hide   from you guys
se-x-u-ally
really wrong
I mean, just because something's   difficult doesn't mean that you quit
Right, totally
I mean, I was so sure this was what   I wanted
So
Yeah
I love ya
Alright, I'm going to bed
You have to let me in
Dude, you're not tanned
Hey
Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend
You can  take   a hint
Yeah
We're having a party
Well, can't you just have the party when we get back
No
emotionally
I read about it in Maxim
Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day
Wow, it's like a time capsule
Yeah
it's for her hot friends
When they see this you'll be 52
Hey
Where's the birthday girl
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up
Let me help you with that
Thank you
I know, what are we gonna do
hit on her
My talents as an actor
Oh
I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books
Um, my present
What did you get her
Actually we prepared performances
Separate performances
But equally real
Happy eighteenth birthday
Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years
Well your grandfather and I might not be here
After all, my parents died very young
It’s in a box in the fridge
Sure
I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino’s
I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny
I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour
And you know, I have a massage client soon
huh
She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her
No, it did not
No
The papers thought it was a hate crime
Bye dear
Nighty-night
Nighty-night
How could you just let them leave
You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right
The one I told you about last week
Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go
Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying
Anyone else
No, lets just draw straws
we could flip a coin, and then multiply the
I'm begging you stop
I want the dolphin
Thats a bear
Go
How the hell is that gonna help
Way to go robot
Good job Alan
Hey, good race you guys
Yeah
What
And then I split this to make ears
Well, I'm very impressed
That's my girl
That's how old you are
Why don't we just take this one
and head to Canada
I was kidding
No, not yet
Oh good, I didn't miss the party
What about your massage client
You ran past us on the stairs
Thanks you guys
You're that many
I'll put a candle on the cake
Thanks
Are you okay
Okay, you ready
Yeah
She has cookies all the time
Have you
Of course, I'd be honored
Thanks
Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey
Clearly we were wrong
"Dear baby adoption decider people
Hey
Don't you look nice
Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary
Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex
YEAH
So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate
Ehm, a Knicks game
Hey
Still sharp as a tack
Amy, this is Charlie
Hi
Hi
The "Days of Our Lives" guy
That's right, yeah
You're not good
Always nice to meet a fan
So now, what are you doing here
Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier
I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart
I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated
Why don't you use your Thesaurus
So beautiful
Oh, I know, isn't she
No, I was talking about your bedding
What's your news, Amy
I'm getting married
To who
He has a killer apartment
A-And
And the elevator opens up right into the living room
No, what's he like
Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark
Yeah
It's his dad
wow, so he's gotta be
But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there
it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like
I told you he was old
Do you remember Barry
Ok
I’m gonna marry Myron and keep looking   for Mr Right
I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH
oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal
Really
I used the the-saurus
On every word
Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’
And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps
Amy, hi
I took your advice, I left Myron
Oh, good for you
I'm Erin Brockovich
Oh, I am so proud of you
So, can I stay with you
Well, I’m staying with you guys
You slept out here
Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get off
'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone
And I know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok
Good morning
Oh, sweety, you can’t pull this off
I just had the worst anniversary ever
Seriously
Word
Well, mine was worse than that
Well, do you wanna marry him
Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing
I think it could be kind of great
There's nothing like it
Ok, ok, so how should I do it
Because my throat's been hurting
Menstrual cramps
No, sorry sweety
Yeah
Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child
Why not
She just offered to do something for another human being
How's the second draft of the letter coming
You dropped it off
Yeah
Hi
Hey, what did you guys do today
Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi
That sounds like fun
He's gonna flip out
Nah, I don't really want her to see
Why not
Because there are so many terrible sights in this world
She needs to have a cool fun aunt
Since when
That's not a thing
Going go to the bathroom
Well, I think you should wait
Why
if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients
You're kicking me out
You put holes in my baby's ears
Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative
Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds
Hips or thighs
You can
Mike, obviously you have balls
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm gonna do this now
I love you
baby styling business going
It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly
Hey
OH
My God
Mmh-mmh
Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends
Oh, my first love
Oh
No
It's my first national commercial
Hey, can you cast me in it
Hey
five
So, tell me about the grant
Are you talking about the Dewar grant
Why
Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant
Your ex-boyfriend
Yeah
Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed
Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you
Well, if you think it would help
I'll call him
Anything he really likes
he does have a pretty serious latex fetish
Oh, right
Yeah
Just happen to have my label maker
Why, you don't like her
I think that you need to fight for her
You think
if I do that, that means you don't get her
Hi
Just pass it to your boss
My God, you look absolutely stunning
I am having a good hair day
So, tell me about it
Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert
M-m
See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated
Break up with Charlie
What
What
Did you just say "break up with Charlie"
Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it
Kind of inappropriate, don't you think
Are you serious
If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking
No
But the good news is, Gladys is yours
Wow, what's the bad news
Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too
Huh
You know, I would give her up, for you
No, I couldn't let you do that
But I want to
But I don't want you to
But I insist
What's up
Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me
I watched it
How do you propose to correct this problem
Where might that take place
Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota
Half a dozen
Biely
Three for excavation and two for analysis
Baby It's You
None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology
No, it starts with a silent "M"
I hate being called a liar
But you are a liar
You still here
stipulation
I have to break up with Charlie
You're crazy
romantic
Crazy
But it's an original Buffay
As long as you don't mind that she's haunted
She's yours
She's yours
SHE'S YOURS
She's mine
She's m-i-i-ne
She's mine
I want Gladys
She's mine
She's mine
She's mine
The point is that you lied
Excellent
Now, what do you say
Lying is wrong
AND
I'm a pretty little girl
Your ex-boyfriend is insane
Did you get the grant
Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you
What
He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up
And besides, he's a very ethical man
I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question
Seriously
How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur
Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O
what are you doing here
I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth
Benji
And I would do anything to have you back in my life
Too little, too late, Benji
I can't believe this
Yes
What
romantic
Maybe
WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE
Man, this does not get old
You're mean
Hey you guys
Hey
Hey, what are you doing
Oh, figuring out our wedding plans
That's funny, we were doing the same thing
Yeah
I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was
I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers
I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry
Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that
But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use
Are you serious
Hey
Hey
What's going on
You can't have it both ways
get a baby
porn or cigarettes
I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine
May I help you
We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children
Well, this is very generous
This is completely anonymous
From two kind strangers
Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter
Not necessary
Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y
"Mike Hannigan"
thank you both very much
It feels so good
Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym
I'm really sorry
I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there
Absolutely
All the rest look like they should live under a bridge
And I was thinking Claire Danes
Ok, ok, here we go
Yay
But you already gave all your money to charity
Well, I’ll just ask for it back
I don’t think you can do that
This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids
Ok, careful
Ok
No watch how much she loves this
We’re seriously asking for our money back
The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it back
Excuse me
So you’re asking us to refund your donation to the children
This feels really good
Please come in
Thank you
Would you like something to drink
Oh, water would be fine
We’re really excited about getting this process started
as allowed by law
Your place is just lovely
This building does have a wholesome family feel to it
wholesome, wholesome building
Oh
What
I just realized why I remember this place
What is it
Yes
RAT BASTARD
What was that
Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets    hurt
And you should get over your silly    fears
I'll do it
Good
Guys
We don't want any crazy today
What's going on
Everything doesn't sound fine
Is he alright out there by himself
Ernie
Don't make me go back there
It's tainted
What the hell are you doing
Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble
Well, we're not
That's our code word for danger
We don't have a code word
What
Are you friends with him
I can't believe you never called me
Excuse me
I waited weeks for you to call me
I gave you my number, you never called me
If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you
Oh, that's really ok
Dating is hard
Because, I think what you're looking for is an ATM
No, no, we're here to give the money back
It's not your decision anymore
What
On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money
Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful life together
And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian
Oh, is that you
Wrong number
She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list
That's great
OH
See
I can do this
I don't really even feel him in here anymore
Hey guys
Hi
Hey
We need to talk to you about something
We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year
What
Hey
We made this decision together
She's putting words in your mouth
Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths
I think she's losing her touch
You are way off, lady
with yourself
Okay, we are doing this
and ME
Hey
Happy Thanksgiving
Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day
Could you pick them up for me
You're not making the pies yourself
I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick
Did you at least win the contest
Okay, I see you guys at 4
Can't wait
Why
Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant
Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving
I mean, we could be getting a baby soon
You don't know that
uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready
Three tickets to today's Rangers game
Dude, I wanted him to guess
Oh
Oh my God
Yeah, they're great seats too
Guess where they are
Center ice
Did I do something to you
Hmm, the game's at one
So
Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back
He's right, man
We're still going at the game, right
Yeah
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca
Really
Yeah
You heard them say that
Yeah
Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about
No, what
Why not
Oh, Bob, get off the guy
What a game, huh
Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away
I don't know
One more fight
Okay
They're forty-five minutes late
How late are we
You may want to lose the foam finger
Hey
Oh
You are not at Thanksgiving
No
No, we're late
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani
Yeah, where were you
Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy
Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee
And I won
And it looks like she put makeup on her
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before
That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable
She won a thousand dollars
You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier
Alright, what are we gonna say
You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged
This is so bad
Well, let's just go in there and face them
What is that
It's locked
Stinky
The cranberries
I feel terrible
The floating heads do make a good point
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad
So bad
So bad
Grand Supreme Little Darling
Congratulatioooons
Really girls, not cool
You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway
A day of forgiveness
It's too late for apologies
I don't need your stupid dinner
That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling
Ewww, is that what that is
Sorry
Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving
I'll cook
Let's go out
Hey
You three have a nice Thanksgiving
The three of us
I'm really wedged in here
I'll pull you through
A little late for that
Uhm, we've got turkey grease
Okay
It isn't working
Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain
Well hurry, I can't feel my ears
Can you ever feel your ears
I left them at the park
I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants
The Vein has spoken
Okay, so PUSH
Stop putting things down my pants
Come on guys, PUSH
Come on
What's going on
That was the adoption agency
And
I'm so happy for you
and that knocked up girl in Ohio
I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid
Really
She was in stock
Hi
Hey
Hey
We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio
Your adoption interview
Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby
That is so weird
And so incorrect
She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us
Come on, she's gonna love you guys
Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up
And a lot could still get in our way
What if this woman does pick you guys
She's gonna pick us
So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'
Hey
who's your friend
No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends
OW, why, why, why
Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists
Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with
Mandy
really hot blonde, big boobs
SARAH
Hi
Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice
You're more than welcome to come with us, right
I can see why, nice shirt
You're wearing the same shirt
May I have the human growing inside you
Uh, we're gonna be great
You're gonna be great
Thank you so much for agreeing to see us
Hi
I'll let you get acquainted
I only know you as file 0W33815-D
That's what our friends call us
kind of intimidating
I don't know about that
Hey
Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night
Well
So you're gonna call this one back
Nope
So, she took some fries, big deal
it’s about what the fries represent
What
ALL FOOD
I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER
Hi
Listen to this
You know about the plate thing
Ah, this place is great
Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks
Wow
They will be
All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here
Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants
Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me
I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you
Really
Amen
Does the bible say anything about adoption
And it was good
Wow
So, how’s everything going in here
We’re great, I think I may have asked all my questions
Do you have any question for Erica
We’re very proud of it
Actually, I don’t think we have to
We got some really great stuff
Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got
Do you wanna try some of them on for me
We are NOT signing those papers
Why not
They think we're somebody else
God works in mysterious ways
You have gotta stop
They are writing up the paper right now
What if, what if no one ever picks us
You're Jewish
Good ordering
Enjoy
what is the matter with you
I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay
But you just said "What's mine is yours"
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT
Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead
Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece
Can you excuse me
Oh-oh
Hi
Hey
Hey
I don't understand
My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor
What
That's impossible
I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like
Excuse me
Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it
Hey, so how was your date
Not so good
Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy
My God, get a room
I think I could show this cake a good time
What would you give up, sex or food
Food
sex or dinosaurs
It's like Sophie's Choice
What would you give up, sex or food
I don't know, it's too hard
No, you gotta pick one
Oh, how cute
Yeah
Oh, she looks just like a little doll
Who is the blonde, she's pretty
He's having an affair
He's not having an affair
You know, I'm always right about these things
Those are all really old
Geez
We gotta find a cab and follow them
Hi
You smell like perfume and cigarettes
I was in the car with Nancy all day
Nancy doesn’t smoke
Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that
What do you think of the house
It’s everything we’ve been looking for
Don’t you love the huge yard
This is bringing out a lovely color in you
Do you think we should get it
What do you think
I think we should
I do too
This is huge
I know
How bad you wanna smoke, right now
When do we tell them about this
I mean, why upset everybody over nothing
Oh my God that is gonna be so hard
I know, and with the baby coming
So, should we tell her
Oh, look at her, so happy
If only there were a smaller one to clean this one
No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up
So sorry
Who's Nancy
I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes
Why do you have a realtor
So you're gonna move
Oh my God
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this
Actually, we already found a house we love
What
Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh
TIME LAPSE
Beavers
Yeah it is
Yeah, but so is this
' Coincidence
It smells really bad in here
How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster
Oooohh that’s interesting
But if we win, we get your apartment
Oooooh
Deal
Big fat goalie
Dangerous Liaisons

No, 19
His name was
Maurice
Correct, his profession was
Space cowboy
Oh Gosh
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game
It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding
Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster
NOOOOOOOOO
Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean
No one forced you to raise the stakes
She forced me
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong
Well it stupid, unfair question
Don’t blame the questions
Okay, I'm in love with her
What
What else
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror
I-I do, do that
Can I ask you a question
That's so sweet
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas
And a crappy New Year
This is where you guys belong
It's Nancy, they responded to our offer
We can't afford that
I know
I'm really sorry you guys
You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before
That's okay, we understand
I love that one so much
Well, it's a good thing we got it then
What
We got the house
Oh my God
I just didn't want to tell you in front of them
And a baby
We're growing up
We sure are
Damn it
What are these for
You'll see
What are these for
We got the house
Hey guys
Hey, let me tell them
Great
Oh, that was our favourite game show ever
Except for "Match game"
Or "Win, Lose or Draw"
What did I marry into
Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show
I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond
You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler
Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends
Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric
Who
You're married to my sister
You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her
Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out
Are you asking permission to break the pact
I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room
Awesome, the name really stands out
Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"
Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union
Hey guys
Hey
Hey, Missy
You know, our band is playing on Friday
No Way
No way
Fresh
Boss
Mint
She's gone
You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out
Dude, I was gonna ask her out
I said it first, bro
I mean, we can get laid anytime we want
I had sex in High school
I'm good at it
Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg
Those are the pacts
But we probably couldn't get her anyway
Oh, d'you like it
When's the dirty stuff starting
What
It's just tea
Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points
You put this in your coffee
Your face
It's white
Paper, snow, a ghost
It's heavier then milk
A rock, a dog, the earth
You put this on a sandwich
Salami, anchovies, jam
It's white
Paper, snow, a ghost
It's made from eggs
Chickens
Pass
You put this on a hamburger
Ketchup
Relish
Stop
Oh
You were, uh, almost on a roll there
And we're out
Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right
I've to get surgery on my knee, you just lost me ten grand
I promise, we'll do better next time
So, Saturday night
I'd love to
Great
It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt
Sorry
Really
A lot
You did
Who is it
I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch
Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,
Goodbody
Yeah
How old is your phonebook
Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment
Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off
Are you talking about me
Three hundred dollars, are you kidding
No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book
No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything
It's not like I can take them two at a time
I didn't
Oh really
No
Oh really
I never did anything with Adrienne Turner
Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her
you're talking about
College guys are so cute
You know I've already lost 4 pounds
You can so totally tell
Bean bag chairs
Oh
You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before
We'll pay you
Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know
I mean, what skills do you have
I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame
So maybe something in an office
You know, share your gift, pass the torch
I don't think my mom would mind
Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay
What
Do it for us
He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time
Oak, maple, elm, birch
A match, a candle
"I'd like to go for a walk", uhm "scratch my belly"
I think you're losing it
Uhm, "I have fur", "I like to bark"
When was this
The weekend you guys visited me at school
That's wild
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter
Well, it matters to me
Why
You kissed her that night too
Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed
And now, now I find out that you kissed her first
What bed did you say she was on
Mine
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed
No, she was definitely on my bed
Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed
You were under the pile of coats
I was the pile of coats
OH MY GOD
You were my first kiss ever
Uh, hey
well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday
So he can't come
well, I would just really love it if you would do it
Seriously
I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom
I am pretty wisdomous
Oh
What time is that
You don't know military time
Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that
Just subtract twelve
I told you I just want a simple wedding
Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white
My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums
she backed out
Hey
Hey
Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us
I thought that was for the actual wedding
Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch
That is why
Hey, you're Mike's parents, right
Yes, we are
Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh
Who in God's name are you
When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid
November
What's up
you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet
Heh
FOOTBALL
I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian
I-I sent you a fax about it
I don't have a fax machine
Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises
I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding
I know, I hate being left out of things
It'd be weird if I'm not in it
Hey guys, how is it going
It's our rehearsal for tomorrow
What happened
there's only room for one
as he is me
Please, you're going down
You are going downer
No more so than acting
Strike two
Hey, unless we move in with you, dad
So, what did you decide
I decided to pee
One of his groomsmen fell out
I love you both so much
So good luck with that
What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that
Hey
Happy wedding day
My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back
Wow, this is a lot
You won awards
Hey
What d'you want
Don't make this harder than it already is
What the hell are lorkins
Joseph
Hi
Okay
You too
Oh, I will
Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you
I'm not supposed to tell you
Who's there
I'll tell you at the wedding
Hey, I forgot my scarf
I don't know which one of you guys to pick
Chappy
What
You really want me to come back
Yeah according to the news, most of the city did
Since when do you watch the news
I know
Why don't you guys just do it on the street
What
So technically, would this person be in the wedding
I guess
He can't make it
Oh, no
I'm still ordained from your wedding
Huhuh
Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free
So, you're ready to do this
I love you guys
Okay
Aren't you gonna be cold
I'll be my something blue
You look beautiful
Aren't you freezing
and you have nice eyes
Yeah
Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down
Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife
I do
That really was an incredible wedding
Hi
Hi
Champagne, candle-lit dinners, moonlight walks on the beach, it was sooo ro-man-tic
Oh
So, where's Mike
Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there
Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help
I did not know you spoke French
Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors
you're so sexy
I really wanna be in this play
Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami
Hey
Hey
Why are you wearing my apron
Hey
Hey
These are for Erica
She's gonna eat all those cookies
Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat
you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building
you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"
Oh my God
Honey
I'm so sorry
Is-is he ok
Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated
for me
Oh, I really could
"Je m'appelle Claude"
Je de coup Clow
let's try it again
Ok
Je m'appelle Claude
Je depli mblue
quite what I'm saying
It sounds exactly the same to me
It does, really
Yeah
Really listen
Je te flouppe Fli
Oh, mon Dieu
Hi
Hey
And this is the baby
Erica, baby
Hi
Calm, self
It's really nice to meet you guys, I can't believe I'm here
Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"
Why would you say that
What are you gonna be doing today
Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center
You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty
That actually means something here
Can somebody please go in
I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick
He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok
Ooh, I have a little heart attack
Right, is it painful
So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately
Je m'appelle Claude
Je do call blue
"je"
je
m'ap
mah
pelle
pel
"je"
je
m'ap
mah
pelle
pel
Je m'appelle
Me pooh pooh
Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you
Hey
Oh good
Wow
You've been in my room before
Yeah
You had a rough day, uh
Hey, hey, hey look
What
Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok
Really, I shouldn't feel guilty
Right now you just need to get some rest
Would you stay here with me for a little while
Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we
I had a great time
Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing
Thanks so much for showing me around
How's that now
I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped
I mean, it could be the football guy
Of course it's the shovel-killer
Would we treat him any differently
We have to find out which one the father is
How
I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right
Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq
Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk
Good job
SO lets try it again
I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good
Oh stop that
Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is
it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way
The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do
I'm sorry, what's going on
You really think this man is speaking French
But my French was good
Oh, good
I guess I wanna take off
it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again
I'm glad you agree
It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good
Yeah, that's true
Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time
Oh, ye-ah
birthday
Well, I guess that's all in the past, now
Not even once
No matter how much we want it
Even if we want it really bad
That's what we decided
Uhm, right
It's kinda hard though
Yeah
waste
Okay, can you really tapdance
Archery
No
Horseback riding
Would fall off a lot
You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds
That I can do
Yeah, this is fun, couples night
A dinosaur died a million years ago
My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good
Wow
No one wanted seconds, right
I-I'm good
Gucci wants me
I'm up for tenure
Congratulations
Where did you go to do it
bureau
YOU NEVER DID IT
It's just the idea of being an official Bing
Honey, would you want me to take your name
You've got to live with it
All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan
Mrs Hannigan
You want to come with us
No, thank you
You'll see how close it is to the city
It would mean so much to us
SHOTGUN
Damn it
See you guys later
That was really mature
I'm gonna make them stay here
he's just
Can we not talk about that right now
You are not gonna talk them into staying here
You have to seat us somewhere else
That's always mr Campbell's table
I'm interviewing for another job
With Gukki
You gotta get out there
good energy
Yes, hi
I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé
So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren
I-I don't
You don't
No, I-I-I love it there
It can be anything you want
Well, not anything, I mean
anything
Oh, this could take a while
Get out of my line
I changed it today
Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan
So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock
Princess Consuela
You seriously changed your name to that
Uh-huh
Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela
Hey, how'd the interview go
It's not good
That is a bad interview
was true
Gunther, six glasses
And it's vanilla
how did your thing go
Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days
I-I-I-I can feel it
Can you
But also knowing it means a lot
But more importantly to full well-rounded lives
I can never be fired
Oh
I feel like an idiot
Thank you for letting us see the house again
Ah, so glad you decided to come
Although, you know, I hope you like fungus
What
Place is full of it
We had an inspection and they didn't find anything
Welcome back
I missed you
Oh, me too
Nope
You really did that
Yep
Yeah, but you can't do that
Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to
First name Crap, last name Bag
If you love it, I love it
I love Princess Consuela
Who are you
Eight
Okay, let's hear your great idea
I really don't
What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends
My parents say I'm gonna make new friends
How've you been
Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton
What've you got
Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it
Yes
I hate that guy
Oh
No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him
You don't want me to get a job
Maybe make you his SEXretary
Ugh
The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences
Hey
Hey, where have you been
is great
I'm just messing with you
No
After you, miss Banana Hammock
Yeah
Excuse me
How about Buffay-Hannigan
Really
Do you even know what a banana hammock is
It's a funny word
It's a Speedo
No
She's still at dinner
Who's she with
But I know he just wants to get into her pants
I mean, she's single and he's cute
Excuse me
You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time
We're about to be parents
How was dinner
His wife just had twins
Should we send something
How did the job stuff go
He offered me one
That's great
Congratulations
Previously on Friends
How did the job stuff go
FADE OUT
Please, somebody  say something
So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris
Or facing a bitch of a commute
Okay
All right, we'll work it out
Ooh, what's going on
I got a really incredible job offer
All right
Good for you
Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive
I wouldn't trust it
You okay with this
How can I be okay with this
How is that gonna happen
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes
We really hit it off
You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron
We're not very bright
Yeah
She died
You're kidding
Oh yeah
This will push him over the edge
Seriously, you don't think we should tell him
Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else
What if he reads it in the paper
Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago
What can I do for you
Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this
Then we'll see if she wants to come back
Wow, that is tempting
Isn't that true
And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life
He’s always reading, he's collecting rocks and he’s obsessed with dinosaurs
Everything ok
I’m just mad at my agent
She’d better have a good reason
Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her
Yeah, actually I am
Whoopsie
You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball
And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it
Hi
You know she can’t sleep without it
Stop forcing that thing on her
Ok
Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back
Nooo
I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me
So, you’re not going to Paris
No, I’m still going
I’m showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around
Thanks
What a hole
What do you think
They could be our neighbors, what are they like
She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and she…
This is got to be killing her
Ordinary embolism might
And yet I never run into Beyonce
This can not be happening
Okay, you come up with an idea
We can still get out
We have a deal
Okay, you got it
yes
I'm okay
we can pick up where we left off
Huh
I never stopped loving you
my
Now, I don't think we should get this house now
Hi
Hey
You are never going to believe what happened to me today
What
Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money
They did
I don't even know what department that guy's in
So, what are you gonna do
Well, I took it
So you're staying in New York
YAY
What
You should go
You really think so
I really do
I'm gonna go to Paris
Yeah
And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris
Heads I win, tails you lose
Hey
Hey
So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven
It's all done
Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it
Where's your passport
It should be right next to my plane ticket
Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away
I know
Hey
That's because I'm pregnant
Right, no, I understand
Why isn't she staying with you guys
Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense
My room has this little fridge full of free snacks
Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place
The lease is still in Nana's name
We talked about catching a movie
We're taking a break
From
with scarves
Hey
Where's Mike
My husband has a gig
Yeah, where is it
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party
What did I just say
I'm gonna be fine
Come here, I'll make you a drink
Well, I've been better
Uh-hmm
You guys are gonna come and visit me, right
I'm gonna miss you so much
These aren't mine
Good luck getting another scarf dance from  me
But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before
Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going
Ok
Yeah
Can you come here with me for a minute
She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually
Oh my God
No-one has been more like a sister to me
found them in your old room
I think these are yours
Oh honey
Oh
I don't think so
I haven't cried like that in years
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news
Huh
Well, it needs to be plicit
did you do anything to make her mad
No, I don't think so
It was pretty intense
Mine too
"You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that
I don't get a goodbye
I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am
Tell me about it
Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party
All right, I think I'm gonna head out
Got it
Yeah
Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are
How
Hi
Hey
Come on here, have a seat
Erica, are you okay
They come and go like every few minutes
Oh my God
We just get her some antacids
She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor
Oh my God
Honey, it's gonna be okay
Just breathe
What
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care
What
You can't
All right, ready
All right, now give me your best shot
Erica, are you okay
They come and go like every few minutes
Oh my God
We'll just get her some antacids
She's in labor
Hey
I have to go home
This was amazing
You've learned some new moves
Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke
Ah
Who's laughing now
Good
Next time, can I say breathe
You want some more ice chips
No, I'm okay
Alright, I'll be right back
Where are you going
To use the bathroom
You can't leave me alone with her
What
This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with
What kind of social situation are you comfortable with
It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together
Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes
Any plans for the summer
Maybe church-camp
What
Morning
Hey
It's a baby chick and duck
and Duck Jr
I did not see that coming
Yes
It's a shame people can't visit there
You're almost an uncle
What
Oh my God
She seemed pretty pissed at you
Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out
We totally did it
I know, it's pretty great
Are you guys getting back together
We didn't really get to talk
But do you wanna get back together
So, so is she still going to Paris
Morning
Guess we'll never know how it ends
Okay
Hey
Hey
How did you sleep
You
Good
I bet you did
Would you guys mind giving us a minute
Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck
Morning
Last night was just wonderful
It really was
I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face
It's just a little bit more, honey
This hurts
Is it really that bad
It's the miracle of life
Wow, that is one disgusting miracle
It's a boy
Wow
Is he okay
He's just fine
I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does
I'm really happy for you guys
How do you feel
I'm tired
I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now
The next baby should be along in a minute
We only ordered one
You know it's twins, right
These are the faces of two people in the know
This has never happened before
This is unbelievable
What do we do
We can't split them up
I mean, that's a great day for everybody
Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible
What if it's adopted by a king
Okay
Okay
Okay
Come on, Erica, start pushing again now
And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye
What did you say
No way
Is that what a dinosaur would do
What
She might not even go
Hi
Can't a girl finish a song around here
Hey
Okay
Good luck, mom
What
Yeah
Oh my God
Unbelievable
Hey, you know what might help
Do you think they recognize each other from in there
We're going to take Erica to recovery now
We decided to name the girl-baby Erica
Oh my God, that's just like my name
Son of a gun, it is
Okay, well, bye
Bye
Bye
We'll call you
Okay
Oh, look at these little bunnies
You ready to trade
Okay
Okay
We could trade later
Hey, what are you working on
Hey
No, and I'm not going to
What
Why not
That did not look like fun
You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night
It's pretty clear where she is
We've got time
Hey
What do you have there
You did that yourself
Honey, that's gorgeous
And apparently, there's some big surprise
Oh my God
Oh my God
What
The hospital knows you took two, right
Yes, it's twins
Oh my God
Her name is Erica
Aw
Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica
It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time   together
Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad
Aw, he's gonna be so happy
Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my   coat
Wanna make one of those
How about a whole bunch
Really
Although that sounds kinda   dull
But I'll leave now, or I'm   gonna miss my plane
I love you all so much
I love you
I love you
Call us when you get there
I'll never forget it
So, you just let her go
Yeah
Hey, maybe that's for the best
Yeah
Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye
You can finally get   over her
Except I don't wanna get over her
What
I wanna be with her
Really
Yeah, I'm gonna go after her
Yeah, you are
Get your coat
My coat
This is so cool
What do you, what do you think she's going to   say
Where - where is my coat
My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to   the airport
Okay, guys, wish me luck
Hurry
There's no seatbelt
Alright, alright, let's do this
Hey
18th and East End
I - I don't take passengers
The law says you have to accept any fare
This isn't a real cab
What's your medallion number
My medallion number is, "Get out of the cab
Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now
Now, that you can do
You can open your eyes now
Are we off the bridge
Yes
Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive
Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab
Toll-booth
Hurry
Okay
You got us a chick and a duck
Bird feces
Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now   they're gone
Oh, don't worry, we'll find them
Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins
What did I just step on
Oh
It's okay, it's just an egg roll
Oh
You stepped on my egg roll
I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor
Okay, let's find these birds
They're in the table
Well, that can't be good
We gotta get them out of there
How
You know any birdcalls
Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman
The ball
So what do we do
Maybe we can open this up somehow
Okay
It's all glued together
Does that mean we have to bust it open
Maybe
Oh my God
It's the foosball table
Did that movie ever get made
Have you never chased anyone through the airport before
Not since my cop-show got cancelled
You have to get a ticket to get past security
We're never gonna make it
Your boarding pass, please
Oh, I can't believe this
Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass
Madame, you must have your boarding pass
Hey, I need a ticket
Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets
We're on our honeymoon
And the destination
Whatever is the cheapest
I don't see it, do you see it
No, did we miss it
It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes
Hello
Shoot, they were doing it before
Listen, listen
Isn't that cute
40
It's not on the board
40, Newark airport
What
Why, where are you
Here goes
What's the matter
I need to say goodbye to the table first
I understand
I can't do it
Did you find them
Yeah, they're stuck inside the table
We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it
There's no way we're gonna make it in time
She's got her cell, you could call her
I am not doing this over the phone
Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane
Is everything okay
You have to get off the plane
Why
Something is wrong with the left Philange
Uhm, what was that
Okay, that doesn't sound good
She's almost never right
But she is sometimes
Wait, what are you doing
Well, I can't take this plane now
Excuse me, sir, where are you going
Her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left Philange
Could I get some peanuts
What's wrong with the plane
There's nothing wrong with the plane
The left Philange
There is no Philange
This plane doesn't even have a Philange
I'm not flying on it
Ma'am, please sit down
What's going on
My job here is done
Impressive
Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it
Sorry about the table, man
Yeah
You gonna buy a new one
I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go
Well, at least we got these little guys out
Yeah
I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh
It was nice having birds around again
Maybe we should keep them here with you
What
And, plus, here they'd have their own room
I could get a goose
You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry
So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake
Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine
And you fixed the Philange
Where is she
Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass
No, no, I just have to talk to someone
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass
What are you guys doing here
Okay, you're on
What's going on
Okay, the thing is
Yeah
Don't go
What
Please, don't go
Oh my God
Do not get on this plane
Are you boarding the plane
I know you do
Miss
I - I have to get on the plane
No, you don't
Yes, I do
I really thought she'd stay
Everything's packed
Wow, this is weird
I know
Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat
I put three lasagnas in your freezer
Hey
Hey
So did you guys make it in time
Did she get off the plane
I got off the plane
I do love you
I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again
I don't wanna mess this up again
We are - we're done being stupid
This is it
Wow
It seems smaller somehow
Oh, yeah, that's true
Uh, I haven't
Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up
I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys
So, I guess this is it
We got some time
Okay, should we get some coffee
