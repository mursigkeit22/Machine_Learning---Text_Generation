I write / develop vulgar comedy rpg's with southpark like humor. I've released 5 games so far with a 6th coming out in a few days. They're currently all on Steam but by the end of the year will also be on google play for android devices. I'm currently working on a VERY large project. A new Metal as Phuk game that's planned to be about 20-30 hours long or so. Other than that, I'm tossing around the idea of making a new project to include thousands of people on twitter / other social medias.

A couple of weeks now. It's something I've always wanted to do but honestly,  getting in front of a camera for people online scared me. I was finally able to harden my resolve and get past it a little while ago and go for it!
How‚Äôs Brazil <@488734758847905803>
Hm. Brazil is awesome, in terms of the people I've met here. But the financial and political situation is getting a bit out of hand. We  (wife and I) might be leaving here. It's just tough because of family and friends who can't leave

It‚Äôs suppose to be <@436313570926395407>
i started it just now, so i think you have to talk some more

yeah it was very long
i think he meant "at"
makes way more sense

true that
It isn‚Äôt possibly I have two twitches and the other one is that name with the one underscore
Well you can change that one
It isn‚Äôt possibly I have two twitches and the other one is that name with the one underscore

I write / develop vulgar comedy rpg's with southpark like humor. I've released 5 games so far with a 6th coming out in a few days. They're currently all on Steam but by the end of the year will also be on google play for android devices. I'm currently working on a VERY large project. A new Metal as Phuk game that's planned to be about 20-30 hours long or so. Other than that, I'm tossing around the idea of making a new project to include thousands of people on twitter / other social medias.
