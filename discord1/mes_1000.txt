How was your weekend?;;
what about yours <@443205057974894620> and <@459063782203850752>;;
?;;
Not bad not bad;;
Hey Mango !! My weekend is just finishing now ... we celebrated the baptism of my nephew !! So we are full of food and drinks for at least a week рџµ;;
oh nice <@502171199850414081> !!;;
nice I hope it's good food haha;;
I just went live by the way!;;
https://www.twitch.tv/purplemango_gaming;;
Yes all great food !! Think I gonna explode lol !! I am on my way to watch you !!;;
вќ¤;;
what's up beautiful people?;;
how was you stream nylllaa?;;
I only saw the notification when you were already done рџ¦;;
Hey hey !! ItвЂ™s ok I know we have few hours difference !! It was quiiiiiiiiet lol not a single viewer;;
How are you ?!;;
ah that happens <@502171199850414081> , I had dozens of streams where only 1 friend would watch;;
I'm good, how about you?;;
I am good !! Finally rested from all the extra I had this weekend but I also got a camera for the streams !!;;
oh nice!;;
are you going to stream again later?;;
I have a stream in about 5 hours if you have time рџѓ;;
I will be there for yours and I might be live i donвЂ™t know yet;;
thanks! ;;
if you do go live, send me a message here so I can check it out;;
I am live !;;
Thanks for coming to see me Mango !! That was nice of you really. I canвЂ™t stand to show my face too much so better stop. I tried to make an overlay on my stream can you tell me if it worked please ?! Thanks !!;;
Hm, an overlay?  I saw the messages and your webcam if thats what you mean;;
I had a good time watching you play!;;
I think the overlay is not matching with PlayStation;;
I will talk more in English the next time this time I was in coop with my best friend. And I still have lot of things to learn to make a good live;;
ah that's ok;;
overlays only work when you have a capture card;;
(like an elgato);;
you connect the elgato to your computer and your ps4;;
that's what I do;;
and then you use software on your computer to stream the game;;
https://www.twitch.tv/purplemango_gaming I am now live;;
;;

Thanks guys! It means a lot to get bday wishes today. I hope you all have great Fridays and weekends! But Slaomething sad happened this morning, which will prevent me from streaming:;;
After a 9-year battle with cancer, my uncle passed away this morning.;;
Man, I'm sorry to hear that. My condolences, bro.;;
Omg i am sorry to hear that ;;
<@488734758847905803> my sincere condolences;;
Thanks guys. It was a tough struggle and it was really hard to see him so sick. It was a peculiar sort of relief that he isn't suffering anymore. But I wish it hadn't happened on my bday.;;
I'm really gonna miss him;;
But I really appreciate the kind words everyone! It really really means a lot;;
If you need a sympathetic ear, don't hesitate to let us know, man;;
Thanks man. That really makes me feel better. It's nice to know there's someone who's there to listen;;

"Hey <@216717411645259777> , better now. Here in Brazil we have the wake and funeral within 24 hours so all the ceremonies have taken place. I saw the whole family, cried it out and we all feel better now that the initial ""shock"" has passed";;
Thanks for asking!;;
Hope everyone else had a good Friday night!;;
Glad you're feeling at least a little bit better, <@488734758847905803> . Losing a loved one is tough but I know you're gonna be okay, bro.;;
ItвЂ™s good to hear you could have said goodbye to him with your family by your side. Just enjoy the time with your beloved ones now for healing itвЂ™s the best thing you can do.  We are here if you need <@488734758847905803> try to get some rest and to stay a bit positive.;;

morning everyone!;;
how are you all doing on this fine friday?;;
I'm doing pretty well, man! Just woke up actually! lol How's everything on your end?;;
nice!;;
what do you do for work <@216717411645259777> ?;;
everything's good here. I'm just procrastinating on work a bit;;
I work as a legal assistant in my parents' law firm! They've actually been super supportive  of the transition to streaming so that means that they either REALLY support my dreams or I've been doing a REALLY bad job! XD;;
nice!;;
oh lordy lord hahahahaah;;
how long have you been streaming for?;;
A couple of weeks now. It's something I've always wanted to do but honestly,  getting in front of a camera for people online scared me. I was finally able to harden my resolve and get past it a little while ago and go for it!;;
oh cool!;;
you're doing a good job, man!;;
keep it up;;
Thanks, bro! That's means a lot! If you have any tips or criticisms, I'd really appreciate your input!;;
no probs!;;
hm... from that first stream that I saw I dont think I have anything to add. next time I watch I can keep a more critical eye;;
Great!;;
when's your next stream planned?;;
1:30 your time! I'm trying to ramp up and do two streams a day. One at 12:30 C/1:30 E/10:30 P and one at 10:30 C/11:30 E/8:30 P.;;
Might not do the night stream on Fridays because I got DnD lol;;
nice!;;
my time is actually brazil time, but I post in EST to make it easier for people in the States.;;
so are you streaming in an hour?;;
yeah friday night streams are tough acts haha;;
I only go to about 8pm my time;;
Right! I forgot! What time is it over in Brazil?;;
right now it's 1:40pm;;
Ahh okay!;;
I'm going to go live in a bit ! like 5 min;;
I am now live! Come stop by if you have the time. https://twitch.tv/purplemango_gaming;;
good morning / afternoon everyone!;;
hope you all have a great saturday!;;
how's the weather <@502171199850414081> ? has France stopped flooding? haha;;
Hiya <@488734758847905803> !! The weather is a little better since few hours till Sunday and next week they say rain rain again. So the constant changing weather gives me tremendous pain. Hope you are good as well as everyone.;;
damn, that sucks. ;;
I got a bit sick yesterday, have a bit of a fever now;;
even had to cut my stream a few hours short;;
but nothing some water and fruits can't help;;
Hope you will feel better soon.;;
thanks рџѓ;;
;;
hey <@198559580190539776> !! welcome my bro!;;
hope youre all having a great sunday;;
Ayo wayo;;
I'm doing fine, just want to cosplay as a certain character but it might create issues with Twitch if I did;;
;;
YOOOO;;
So I'm not sure if I even want to go through with it tbh;;
A PROPHECY FORETOLD;;
UWU;;
hm;;
;;
"I dont know if thyell ""find out""";;
what up <@235876529060446208> !!;;
thanks for joining the discord my bros in arms;;
But if they do confuse my outfit for something racist, I might be screwed;;
So idk if the chance is worth it;;
Tbh;;
oh;;
for something racist;;
i thought it had to do with IP;;
I'm not purposely trying to make it that way;;
;;
It just so happens his hat looks like a familiar hat;;
So yeah, big oof;;
ah;;
I dont think thatll be an issue man;;
it looks like an army cap to me;;
but what do I know;;
I'll try it out;;
But I hope Twitch doesn't ban me for cosplay;;
it could just be considered a gimmick depending on how far you take it;;
I won't reference anything that relates it to what people could confuse it as;;
So hopefully I'll be fine;;
true, true;;
<@235876529060446208> said youd be fine;;
but I honestly dont know about twitch's policy;;
Tbh, idk either;;
They have a long ass policy I barely read;;
hahahaah;;
truer true;;
;;

Thanks, bro!;;
Cause I haven't done anything for the past 8 days;;
Oof;;
whenever you guys are gonna stream, post a link there;;
lol i know the feeling;;
Alrighty ^-^;;
I kinda feel bad because they're loyal to me;;
And I feel like dirt for not giving them at least one stream;;
T.T;;
try to stream consistently, but if youre busy / sick, just post on your Twitter account that you won't make it.;;
try not leaving them in the dark and usually theyll understand;;

Nope;;
Sadly I haven't;;
if your pc is mildly decent, you can prob get a ps2 emulator;;

I probably would;;
My brother probably already has it;;
So I can always play on his ps2;;
nice;;
def give it a shot;;
do you have a ps3?;;
Ye;;
And a ps4;;
then you can buy it there also;;
in the classics section;;
But they're my brother/dad's;;
ah i see;;
I sold my xbox one to my stepdad omegalul;;
All I have is my gamecube and my xbox 360;;
My gameboy, 3ds, ds lite, etc.;;
true true.;;
lots of handhelds haha;;

nothing at the moment to be honest. I am a Halo fanboy so I am patneitly waiting for a new halo. Halo tournaments was how I made beer money during college. Back when I had hand eye coordination -_-;;
Walking dead;;

oh nice <@323618354701271041>;;

lmao;;
UwU;;
Gm;;
it seems like it's more a favor to you <@434526286115897344> hahaha;;
yo yo yo;;
morning <@198559580190539776>;;
what is up my bro?;;
I'll pop in while at work my guy;;
Not much, just losing/gaining new/old supporters;;
It's weird, but I'm gaining more than I lose so all is well;;
true that;;
i lost about 5 in the past week, but it's all good.;;
I seriously don't know why though;;
streaming is a grind, and it takes a while anyway;;
it could be twitch's bugs;;
i've heard of some accounts losing all their followed channels;;
Like why do people start unfollowing when you hit near 300;;
Oh;;
That's a big issue;;
Yeah it was happening to me as well.;;
Oh well lol;;
yeah it is;;
it's a coding bug of Twitch's;;
Yeah because I was following Nerdy_Momma;;
But it said I wasn't;;
:/;;
right;;
it's the worst bug for small / medium streamers;;
Strange;;
They need to fix that shit;;
It'll make a lot of small/big streamers lose a lot of support;;
But of course the smaller bois get hit the most;;
exactly;;
ok, i thought of a question of the day @everyone ;;
what was the video game soundtrack that caused the greatest impact on you?;;
for me, it was the Ocarina of Time;;
Hotline Miami;;
It's got some spicy music by various artists with no lyrics;;
But the songs speak for themselves;;
Yeet;;
<:PurpleMMMANGO:499310401465352197>;;
nice nice!;;
good choice;;
;;
Def Jam fight for N.Y;;
Good morning;;
damn, true that <@434526286115897344>;;
morning <@459504171113250837> !!;;
IвЂ™m from that area so that soundtrack was home;;
Wasup bros;;
<@459504171113250837> morning sir;;
true.;;
we were tri-state buddies then haha;;
not much my dude, how about you?;;
it's so hard to focus on work with so many awesome people talking and streaming!;;
"Yeah I cant focus I'm on ""break"" lol";;
Contemplating on streaming tonight. If I do there will be no game sound but IвЂ™ll try to hook up some music to play thru the elgato. What do you guys think?;;
lol i know what you mean;;
What happened to your game sound?;;
sounds good to me, depending on the game if i'm being honest;;
Chugging my bang down then gotta get back in there;;
Yeah I'll be streaming for a short bit at 4pm ct;;
I'll pop in to yalls stream as well;;
<@482884788399767592> my PS4 controller took a shit on me and IвЂ™m using the wired PS4 game pad that has no jack for the headphones.;;
<@488734758847905803> game will be either Black Ops 4 or Battlefield 1;;
<@482884788399767592> waiting until Friday to get a new one;;
What about plugging a headset to your monitor/tv?;;
true that <@482884788399767592> dont forget to drop that link in self promote when you do!;;
Thanks for the ones who came by to say hi !! I really appreciate it !!! Much love guys;;
I'm new to this discord! I'll try to pop in next time <@502171199850414081>;;
<@482884788399767592> I didnвЂ™t think of that. IвЂ™ll try it out when I get out of work. Thanx;;
ItвЂ™s ok <@482884788399767592> I m new as well so I understand no worries !!;;
Yeah that is what I do. I have 2 mics 1 for chat and 1 for my party. But that is why your stream doesnt have the game audio because you're plugged into the controller.;;
Just go to your settings->audio devices->output->click TV amplifier;;
Nice tip <@482884788399767592> !;;
Pain in the arse to figure out lol;;
Yeah. The way I did it was to get an HDMI audio extractor and then an adaptor to plug in my headphones;;
Only prob is that then you can't increase your volume;;
<@488734758847905803> im late to the party but the Halo soundtrack. I still play it when im grinding out at work. It is on spotify if anyone wants to listen;;
Halo 2 was my jam.;;
@everyone Finally got around to following a lot of you guys. Sorry if I missed someone,  Ill get around to you. Hope I am available to hang out when you are live;;
<@342732640815677453> got you !!;;

Got you too <@482884788399767592>;;
You da best!!!!!;;
Well itвЂ™s a team rise right so will help everyone I can !!!;;
I may have forgot to follow some peeps back. If i did let me know. I dont usually do F4F crap but I like you folks. You are all good company;;
Yeah I donвЂ™t either usually but here itвЂ™s different <@323618354701271041>;;
<:PurpleMMMANGO:499310401465352197>;;
why is the purple mango facing the other direction?!;;
<:SliverMango:499310401389985832> <:PurpleMMMANGO:499310401465352197> <:GoldMango:499310401289191434> <:BronzeMango:499310401335590922>;;

Cool;;
Oh shit is on fire here;;
<@323618354701271041> it's actually an interesting story;;
My wife made those emotes and she accidentally mirrored the purple one hahahaha;;
As for the f4f, I took a page out of the team rise / team SPOC book and made this community to be a support 4 support. ;;
There are some people here who aren't team rise and have gotten into that supportive vibe perfectly!;;
I gotta say I am super happy to see you all here and chatting and supporting. You guys are awesome and I'm not just saying that haha;;
Btw, it took me a while to answer cause I'm doing some stuff out of the house. I'm almost never out of my house. ;;
I hate the outside world;;
Nah jk about hating the outdoors lol;;
lol;;
Are you LAUGHING AT ME WARMAN?!;;
You dare mock the Mangoest Mango?;;
*pulls mango seeds* this is going to hurt you more than it hurts me;;
<:PurpleMMMANGO:499310401465352197> <:SliverMango:499310401389985832> <:PurpleMMMANGO:499310401465352197> <:GoldMango:499310401289191434> <:PurpleMMMANGO:499310401465352197> <:BronzeMango:499310401335590922>;;
