How was your weekend?;;
what about yours <@443205057974894620> and <@459063782203850752>;;
?;;
Not bad not bad;;
Hey Mango !! My weekend is just finishing now ... we celebrated the baptism of my nephew !! So we are full of food and drinks for at least a week üòµ;;
oh nice <@502171199850414081> !!;;
nice I hope it's good food haha;;
I just went live by the way!;;
https://www.twitch.tv/purplemango_gaming;;
Yes all great food !! Think I gonna explode lol !! I am on my way to watch you !!;;
‚ù§;;
what's up beautiful people?;;
how was you stream nylllaa?;;
I only saw the notification when you were already done üò¶;;
Hey hey !! It‚Äôs ok I know we have few hours difference !! It was quiiiiiiiiet lol not a single viewer;;
How are you ?!;;
ah that happens <@502171199850414081> , I had dozens of streams where only 1 friend would watch;;
I'm good, how about you?;;
I am good !! Finally rested from all the extra I had this weekend but I also got a camera for the streams !!;;
oh nice!;;
are you going to stream again later?;;
I have a stream in about 5 hours if you have time üòÉ;;
I will be there for yours and I might be live i don‚Äôt know yet;;
thanks! ;;
if you do go live, send me a message here so I can check it out;;
I am live !;;
Thanks for coming to see me Mango !! That was nice of you really. I can‚Äôt stand to show my face too much so better stop. I tried to make an overlay on my stream can you tell me if it worked please ?! Thanks !!;;
Hm, an overlay?  I saw the messages and your webcam if thats what you mean;;
I had a good time watching you play!;;
I think the overlay is not matching with PlayStation;;
I will talk more in English the next time this time I was in coop with my best friend. And I still have lot of things to learn to make a good live;;
ah that's ok;;
overlays only work when you have a capture card;;
(like an elgato);;
you connect the elgato to your computer and your ps4;;
that's what I do;;
and then you use software on your computer to stream the game;;
https://www.twitch.tv/purplemango_gaming I am now live;;
;;

Thanks guys! It means a lot to get bday wishes today. I hope you all have great Fridays and weekends! But Slaomething sad happened this morning, which will prevent me from streaming:;;
After a 9-year battle with cancer, my uncle passed away this morning.;;
Man, I'm sorry to hear that. My condolences, bro.;;
Omg i am sorry to hear that ;;
<@488734758847905803> my sincere condolences;;
Thanks guys. It was a tough struggle and it was really hard to see him so sick. It was a peculiar sort of relief that he isn't suffering anymore. But I wish it hadn't happened on my bday.;;
I'm really gonna miss him;;
But I really appreciate the kind words everyone! It really really means a lot;;
If you need a sympathetic ear, don't hesitate to let us know, man;;
Thanks man. That really makes me feel better. It's nice to know there's someone who's there to listen;;
‚ù§;;
;;

Thanks for asking!;;
Hope everyone else had a good Friday night!;;
Glad you're feeling at least a little bit better, <@488734758847905803> . Losing a loved one is tough but I know you're gonna be okay, bro.;;
It‚Äôs good to hear you could have said goodbye to him with your family by your side. Just enjoy the time with your beloved ones now for healing it‚Äôs the best thing you can do.  We are here if you need <@488734758847905803> try to get some rest and to stay a bit positive.;;

morning everyone!;;
how are you all doing on this fine friday?;;
I'm doing pretty well, man! Just woke up actually! lol How's everything on your end?;;
nice!;;
what do you do for work <@216717411645259777> ?;;
everything's good here. I'm just procrastinating on work a bit;;
I work as a legal assistant in my parents' law firm! They've actually been super supportive  of the transition to streaming so that means that they either REALLY support my dreams or I've been doing a REALLY bad job! XD;;
nice!;;
oh lordy lord hahahahaah;;
how long have you been streaming for?;;
A couple of weeks now. It's something I've always wanted to do but honestly,  getting in front of a camera for people online scared me. I was finally able to harden my resolve and get past it a little while ago and go for it!;;
oh cool!;;
you're doing a good job, man!;;
keep it up;;
Thanks, bro! That's means a lot! If you have any tips or criticisms, I'd really appreciate your input!;;
no probs!;;
hm... from that first stream that I saw I dont think I have anything to add. next time I watch I can keep a more critical eye;;
Great!;;
when's your next stream planned?;;
1:30 your time! I'm trying to ramp up and do two streams a day. One at 12:30 C/1:30 E/10:30 P and one at 10:30 C/11:30 E/8:30 P.;;
Might not do the night stream on Fridays because I got DnD lol;;
nice!;;
my time is actually brazil time, but I post in EST to make it easier for people in the States.;;
so are you streaming in an hour?;;
yeah friday night streams are tough acts haha;;
I only go to about 8pm my time;;
Right! I forgot! What time is it over in Brazil?;;
right now it's 1:40pm;;
Ahh okay!;;
I'm going to go live in a bit ! like 5 min;;
I am now live! Come stop by if you have the time. https://twitch.tv/purplemango_gaming;;
good morning / afternoon everyone!;;
hope you all have a great saturday!;;
how's the weather <@502171199850414081> ? has France stopped flooding? haha;;
Hiya <@488734758847905803> !! The weather is a little better since few hours till Sunday and next week they say rain rain again. So the constant changing weather gives me tremendous pain. Hope you are good as well as everyone.;;
damn, that sucks. ;;
I got a bit sick yesterday, have a bit of a fever now;;
even had to cut my stream a few hours short;;
but nothing some water and fruits can't help;;
Hope you will feel better soon.;;
thanks üòÉ;;
;;
hey <@198559580190539776> !! welcome my bro!;;
hope youre all having a great sunday;;
Ayo wayo;;
I'm doing fine, just want to cosplay as a certain character but it might create issues with Twitch if I did;;
;;
YOOOO;;
So I'm not sure if I even want to go through with it tbh;;
A PROPHECY FORETOLD;;
UWU;;
hm;;
;;
"I dont know if thyell ""find out""";;
what up <@235876529060446208> !!;;
thanks for joining the discord my bros in arms;;
But if they do confuse my outfit for something racist, I might be screwed;;
So idk if the chance is worth it;;
Tbh;;
oh;;
for something racist;;
i thought it had to do with IP;;
I'm not purposely trying to make it that way;;
;;
It just so happens his hat looks like a familiar hat;;
So yeah, big oof;;
ah;;
I dont think thatll be an issue man;;
it looks like an army cap to me;;
but what do I know;;
I'll try it out;;
But I hope Twitch doesn't ban me for cosplay;;
it could just be considered a gimmick depending on how far you take it;;
I won't reference anything that relates it to what people could confuse it as;;
So hopefully I'll be fine;;
true, true;;
<@235876529060446208> said youd be fine;;
but I honestly dont know about twitch's policy;;
Tbh, idk either;;
They have a long ass policy I barely read;;
hahahaah;;
truer true;;
;;

Thanks, bro!;;
Cause I haven't done anything for the past 8 days;;
Oof;;
whenever you guys are gonna stream, post a link there;;
lol i know the feeling;;
Alrighty ^-^;;
I kinda feel bad because they're loyal to me;;
And I feel like dirt for not giving them at least one stream;;
T.T;;
try to stream consistently, but if youre busy / sick, just post on your Twitter account that you won't make it.;;
try not leaving them in the dark and usually theyll understand;;

Nope;;
Sadly I haven't;;
if your pc is mildly decent, you can prob get a ps2 emulator;;

I probably would;;
My brother probably already has it;;
So I can always play on his ps2;;
nice;;
def give it a shot;;
do you have a ps3?;;
Ye;;
And a ps4;;
then you can buy it there also;;
in the classics section;;
But they're my brother/dad's;;
ah i see;;
I sold my xbox one to my stepdad omegalul;;
All I have is my gamecube and my xbox 360;;
My gameboy, 3ds, ds lite, etc.;;
true true.;;
lots of handhelds haha;;
if you have a ps vita it's also there;;

nothing at the moment to be honest. I am a Halo fanboy so I am patneitly waiting for a new halo. Halo tournaments was how I made beer money during college. Back when I had hand eye coordination -_-;;
Walking dead;;

oh nice <@323618354701271041>;;
I think that is the only thing that would make me dust off the xbox';;

Yoooooooooooo;;
ITS ALMOST TIME FOR YOU TO JOIN ME IN TODAYS WAR! (Indicating I'll be live in thirty);;

lmao;;
UwU;;
Gm;;
it seems like it's more a favor to you <@434526286115897344> hahaha;;
yo yo yo;;
morning <@198559580190539776>;;
what is up my bro?;;
I'll pop in while at work my guy;;
Not much, just losing/gaining new/old supporters;;
It's weird, but I'm gaining more than I lose so all is well;;
true that;;
i lost about 5 in the past week, but it's all good.;;
I seriously don't know why though;;
streaming is a grind, and it takes a while anyway;;
it could be twitch's bugs;;
i've heard of some accounts losing all their followed channels;;
Like why do people start unfollowing when you hit near 300;;
Oh;;
That's a big issue;;
Yeah it was happening to me as well.;;
Oh well lol;;
yeah it is;;
it's a coding bug of Twitch's;;
Yeah because I was following Nerdy_Momma;;
But it said I wasn't;;
:/;;
right;;
it's the worst bug for small / medium streamers;;
Strange;;
They need to fix that shit;;
It'll make a lot of small/big streamers lose a lot of support;;
But of course the smaller bois get hit the most;;
exactly;;
ok, i thought of a question of the day @everyone ;;
what was the video game soundtrack that caused the greatest impact on you?;;
for me, it was the Ocarina of Time;;
Hotline Miami;;
It's got some spicy music by various artists with no lyrics;;
But the songs speak for themselves;;
Yeet;;
<:PurpleMMMANGO:499310401465352197>;;
nice nice!;;
good choice;;
;;
Def Jam fight for N.Y;;
Good morning;;
damn, true that <@434526286115897344>;;
morning <@459504171113250837> !!;;
I‚Äôm from that area so that soundtrack was home;;
Wasup bros;;
<@459504171113250837> morning sir;;
true.;;
we were tri-state buddies then haha;;
not much my dude, how about you?;;
it's so hard to focus on work with so many awesome people talking and streaming!;;
"Yeah I cant focus I'm on ""break"" lol";;
Contemplating on streaming tonight. If I do there will be no game sound but I‚Äôll try to hook up some music to play thru the elgato. What do you guys think?;;
lol i know what you mean;;
What happened to your game sound?;;
sounds good to me, depending on the game if i'm being honest;;
Chugging my bang down then gotta get back in there;;
Yeah I'll be streaming for a short bit at 4pm ct;;
I'll pop in to yalls stream as well;;
<@482884788399767592> my PS4 controller took a shit on me and I‚Äôm using the wired PS4 game pad that has no jack for the headphones.;;
<@488734758847905803> game will be either Black Ops 4 or Battlefield 1;;
<@482884788399767592> waiting until Friday to get a new one;;
What about plugging a headset to your monitor/tv?;;
true that <@482884788399767592> dont forget to drop that link in self promote when you do!;;
Thanks for the ones who came by to say hi !! I really appreciate it !!! Much love guys;;
I'm new to this discord! I'll try to pop in next time <@502171199850414081>;;
<@482884788399767592> I didn‚Äôt think of that. I‚Äôll try it out when I get out of work. Thanx;;
It‚Äôs ok <@482884788399767592> I m new as well so I understand no worries !!;;
Yeah that is what I do. I have 2 mics 1 for chat and 1 for my party. But that is why your stream doesnt have the game audio because you're plugged into the controller.;;
Just go to your settings->audio devices->output->click TV amplifier;;
Nice tip <@482884788399767592> !;;
Pain in the arse to figure out lol;;
Yeah. The way I did it was to get an HDMI audio extractor and then an adaptor to plug in my headphones;;
Only prob is that then you can't increase your volume;;
<@488734758847905803> im late to the party but the Halo soundtrack. I still play it when im grinding out at work. It is on spotify if anyone wants to listen;;
Halo 2 was my jam.;;
@everyone Finally got around to following a lot of you guys. Sorry if I missed someone,  Ill get around to you. Hope I am available to hang out when you are live;;
<@342732640815677453> got you !!;;

Got you too <@482884788399767592>;;

Well it‚Äôs a team rise right so will help everyone I can !!!;;
I may have forgot to follow some peeps back. If i did let me know. I dont usually do F4F crap but I like you folks. You are all good company;;
Yeah I don‚Äôt either usually but here it‚Äôs different <@323618354701271041>;;
<:PurpleMMMANGO:499310401465352197>;;

<@323618354701271041> it's actually an interesting story;;
My wife made those emotes and she accidentally mirrored the purple one hahahaha;;
As for the f4f, I took a page out of the team rise / team SPOC book and made this community to be a support 4 support. ;;
There are some people here who aren't team rise and have gotten into that supportive vibe perfectly!;;
I gotta say I am super happy to see you all here and chatting and supporting. You guys are awesome and I'm not just saying that haha;;
Btw, it took me a while to answer cause I'm doing some stuff out of the house. I'm almost never out of my house. ;;
I hate the outside world;;
Nah jk about hating the outdoors lol;;
lol;;
Are you LAUGHING AT ME WARMAN?!;;

*pulls mango seeds* this is going to hurt you more than it hurts me;;

@everyone - quick message here:;;
With black friday coming up, I became an Amazon affiliate and have a link here that if you click on and buy something, i will get money from that. you have to pay ABSOLUTELY NOTHING more than what you'd normally pay. So, if you guys buy anything at all, i'd LOVE it if you bought it with my link:;;
;;
https://amzn.to/2EId2Qs;;
I need to make and build my YouTube channel;;
post that youtube link in the self-promote or social media tab <@442488674144223242> !;;
yeah, youtube is a bit harder than twitch isnt it?;;
I haven't even messed with it;;
posted a damn invite to my discord instead of the amazon link lol;;
yeah it's tough <@372392575547473920>;;
imo at  least;;
Ahahaha grats lol;;
haha;;

Good morning @everyone it‚Äôs Thursday which means the weekend is almost here. Hope you all have a great day and if your streaming have an awesome stream.;;

good morning all;;
damn, it's good evening on my end <@442488674144223242> haha;;
but have a good morning to ya lmao;;
Hey Im a streamer and I‚Äôm almost affiliated if you‚Äôd like to check me out my twitch is twitch.tv/ttv_joedog_;;
With two underscores one between ttv and joedog the other at the end;;
well it's well into the afternoon now;;
I meant whenever you get a chance or if you want to I didn‚Äôt mean right this minute;;
True that <@442488674144223242> hahaha;;
Don't know why discord doesn't let you post your link the way it is;;
That's annoying;;
<@374022856088092672> I was referring to <@488734758847905803> saying it was evening;;
twitch.tv/_ ttvjoedog_;;
Son of a bitch;;
twitch.tv/_ ttvjoedog.    _;;
Oh;;
Omfg;;
And it don‚Äôt work;;
I tried putting spaces between the damn things;;
twitch.tv/_ttvjoedog;;
Ok, so there we added 1 underscore at least;;
Then you just have to add one more afterwards;;
Lolz yeah true but it‚Äôs in the wrong place;;
Oh shit;;
twitch.tv/ttv_joedog;;
There we go;;
Is it possible to remove that second underscore in the future?;;
You have no idea how annoying that will be for you in the future in discord;;
It isn‚Äôt possibly I have two twitches and the other one is that name with the one underscore;;
Well you can change that one;;
And then change this one;;
You can change your usernam every 60 days if I'm not mistaken;;
;;
Yo yo yo! <@267521450146136064> is in the shade of the mango tree. Let's all welcome our newest mango seed here everyone!;;
Don't forget to drop those social media links in the respective tab so people can follow you on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc. And your twitch channel in the self-promo tab whenever you go live on your streams;;

Actually yes I‚Äôm actually sitting is a stand for hunting;;
true that haha;;
Good morning /afternoon to everyone hope y‚Äôall have a great day under the shade of the mango tree and maybe take a nice nap;;
@everyone some info here - If you guys don't know about Binx tv (https://binx.tv/) this is how it goes:;;
;;
"You sign up and link your Twitch account to your Binx account. The point of doing this is that you sometimes get ""Binx Raided"". When that happens, Binx takes viewers to your channel, and those viewers that stay have a chance to win a free game. ANY game. It is random and free for those viewers. so Binx helps with your viewer average, helps to get viewers. and if those viewers like what they see, they follow / chat, etc.";;
;;
Now. The thing is, people have to vote for you every month to increase your chances of getting raided.;;
If you create a binx account, send me the link either in DM or in chat (but tag me in the message so I can be sure that I'll get it) and I am going to create a tab so that we can vote for each other every month.;;
If my explanation was unclear, give me a shout and I'll explain better!;;
;;
much love to you all, and may you chill and nap in the shade of the mango tree as <@374022856088092672> has put it ‚ù§;;
morning joe-dawg;;
i love binx man;;

"considering the trophy for that chapter was called ""the big reveal""";;

;;

mangoes are the best for sure.;;
and of course!;;
so, if you use twitter, instagram, or whatevs, you can post that in the links for social media tab;;
and when you go live you can use the self-promo tab;;
Good morning fellow mango seeds!;;
hey there <@372392575547473920> !;;
I'm excited to see pics of your food in that pictures and memes tab in a few weeks;;
Oh it'll be coming for sure. Im just waiting a couple more weeks before i start job searching;;
true true;;
I can wait, i can wait;;

I literally joined binx yesterday and won a game in my first raid;;
NICE;;
returned it for coins though but still a cool concept;;
you lucky devil;;
Oh nice. I have a binx account I've just never streamed on it;;
I dont think you have to stream on it, I think once you link your twitch account it goes online automatically;;
Oh nice. I need to see if I did that then;;
Goodmorning;;

https://www.youtube.com/user/AngryCentaurGaming - check out this amazing youtuber. He is a verified twitch partner as well;;
he has saved me at least 600 dollars over the last few years with games that I was going to buy and didnt because of his reviews;;
he accepts 0 sponsors;;
Doing good n u bro;;

pretty good as well;;
Awesome;;

Morning!;;

Hey <@459504171113250837> how‚Äôs it going ?;;
thanks <@459504171113250837> !;;

Morning!!;;
Anytime bro;;
Morning @everyone happy Fortnite Friday. Hope you guys have a great day and can‚Äôt wait to see all the awesome streams later on.;;
morning <@434526286115897344> !;;
good luck building and shooting;;
Oh Boy Fortnite Friday... lol Something tells me i'm going to have to delete a lot of Forum ~~rants~~ posts tomorrow.;;
I made that reference for <@459504171113250837> since that‚Äôs the only game I‚Äôve seen him play. Lol;;
lmao i see;;
hahah why's that <@276196045502021633> ?;;
he sometimes plays COD4 <@434526286115897344>;;
probably from glider redeploy removed.;;
hm;;
Lol <@434526286115897344>;;
I‚Äôm playing cod today;;
toldya haha;;
Everytime I play Fortnite kids wanna play wit smh;;
It‚Äôs getting annoyed;;
Lol I dont play fortnite that's why I have a goal set for 1000 followers I'll play some Fortnite Strat roulette lol;;
haha;;
<@459504171113250837> haha! Thats why I dont play with viewers. NONE of them turn their mics off.;;
I have had a lot of people coming in asking for F4F;;
Lol I play with viewers but if they get too rowdy I mute them Haha;;
that has increased a lot recently idk why;;
People are trying to make it big without any effort <@323618354701271041> that's why they think more followers = more success;;
i do the same if i have to but then i feel bad because i cant hear if theyre asking questions or not lol;;
yeah, lets have 5000 followers but 4 viewers;;
makes sense haha;;
id rather have legit followers than that crap;;
Exactly;;
<@459504171113250837> that‚Äôs why I stopped playing fortnite and stick to Black Ops 4 and soon Battlefield 5;;
200 followers who come and hang 5000 nobodies;;
I do notice i have a lot more viewers playing  fortnite vs destiny 2;;
its like a 8-10 avg vs a 3-4 avg;;
But it‚Äôs been such a shitty week and I‚Äôve been in the mood to stream but the excitement wouldn‚Äôt be there. Know what I mean;;
yeah thats how i was on wednesday;;
no motivation, would have just been a zombie on cam lol;;
0 entertainment value;;
yeah, that's how i was yesterday;;
it's best to just postpone a stream;;
than half-ass it;;
Same <@488734758847905803> halfway through my stream I was yawning from exhaustion and boredom so I just ended it before it got worse;;
yeah that's the best way to go;;
it's not easy keeping that high energy the whole time;;
It's just been a long week for me lol we had off Monday for the holiday bit we dont  a day off the rest of the week besides Sunday.  It's like we didnt even get a holiday basically. Same thing next week for Thanksgiving;;
damn...;;
that is tough for sure;;
what do you do for work? i forget, im sorry;;
I get an extra 8 hours of holiday but it's not OT and I'm a teller at a bank;;
oh right;;
you had mentioned that already;;
sorry for forgetting;;
at least you get off the holiday!;;
Lol all good man;;
i use to work at a hospital so i got off every other holiday, i worked christmas day for 8 years before i got my new job;;
get off early on saturdays though right?;;
or is your bank open late;;
Yeah I mean I'm bitching now but at my old job I'd work 14 days straight before getting a day off so it's a lot better;;
same haha!;;
And yeah we get out at 2 on Saturdays;;
thats not too bad, at least you dont work retail.;;
retail hours especially around the holidays stink;;
I was an overnight manager at WaWa (for those of you who know what that is) for 6 years and I get paid more now as a teller;;
i live in NJ, OH I KNOW WAWA;;
hoogiefest should be a national holuday;;
holiday*;;
Lol I'm right over the bridge from Jersey lol;;
damn got another jersey boy here haha;;
PA or NY?;;
PA;;
the wawa, like the conveneince store just before Six Flags?;;
wawa is better than sheetz;;
Yeah  <@488734758847905803>;;
dude WaWa is life;;
sheetz sucks major;;
wawa is where its at;;
I like wawa's sandwiches more than sheetz but sheetz got those fried foods that are amazing;;
i got a coffee from there this morning when i got gas;;
ONE STOP SHOP;;
Especially when you drink af at 4am;;
Drunk*;;
sheetz is good drunk food yeah;;
but an italian from wawa hits the spot too;;
i went to school in PA so sheetz was the only thing we had;;
People got so mad when I left there I used to make the best drinks and hoagies they dont go there anymore since I left üòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
hahahaah;;
damn;;
glad I didnt get addicted to dem hoagies;;
YO YI YO;;
"My last day there I made an AMAZING drink for a girl and she was hitting on me and was like ""omg you need to make this drink for me all the time now when do you work?"" And the look on her face when I told her it was my last day was priceless";;
this has been a shit week for streaming;;
Yo  <@235876529060446208> what's up;;
Yeah <@442488674144223242> I think everyone agrees;;
How are you? I'm waiting for them to turn my card back on;;
Turn your card back on?;;
I don't know about that <@442488674144223242> I've had a great week. Are you live now?;;
Yes;;
My bank;;
last 3 nights have averaged <2 viewers;;
Ahh;;
Oof;;
yeh live now about to end;;
I'm sorry zorbacles;;
It's a grind man  <@442488674144223242> it's a rough week just keep being persistent and consistent the viewers will come man;;
You gotta struggle through it man! Just keep pushing;;
<@217880977353998346> that was a perfect moment for you to say that she could stop by later at your place for food;;
You got this, keep the energy up, and people will start to notice;;
<@488734758847905803> lmfao if I was single I would've but I've had a gf for 4 years now I dont wanna mess that up lol;;
ah ok of course then;;
haha;;
now i got shit ping;;
i hate cheaters;;
Of course don't mess it up;;
<@442488674144223242> before I joined team rise and met these amazing people, i had 2 viewers, one from my cell phone and one from my wife's computer haha;;
it's a tough grind for sure;;
Honestly man  <@442488674144223242> I'd rather have like 2-3 viewers chatting it up with me than 10-12 people just watching that's just me though I enjoy talking with people if I have people chatting im always gonna have a good time;;
but keep it up. all it takes is one stream to change everything;;
week before was all over 5;;
I agree <@217880977353998346>;;
I'll follow you and I'll try to hop in there and get the chat going;;
its like i hit affiliate and everyone stopped caring;;
doesnt help that ive been playing shit which makes it worse;;
"i think what annoys me is seeing on twitter 100 people liking your ""live"" post and then no one comes in.";;
playing poorly really doesnt make that much of a difference if you dont care, at least in my experience;;
i absolutely SUCK at rdr2;;
i die all the time;;
fall of my horse;;
but i just laugh at myself;;
no but im frustrated that im playing bad and frustrated that i have no one watching.;;
if i have people in chat, i dont care how i play;;
but both combined compounds;;
People may come in for the gameplay man but they stay for you <@442488674144223242> if you're liked enough you could be tapping horrendously on a pair of bongos and people will still watch;;
Keep getting that following and entertaining people and the views will come;;
wise words from the Sarge;;
ok im getting > 300 ping now;;
wtf is going on;;
Lol I'm just real man. I've been through it all it sucks but you just gotta roll with the punches take your licks and get back up and start swinging again;;
my stream health is like 0;;
i bet you cant even see what im doing even if you are in;;
Yeah mine disconnected I think I gotta recheck I'm on my phone so it's not easy to multitask;;
24kbs apparently;;
yeah, i can only hear the sound tbh;;
maybe turn the stream off then on again?;;
You on wifi or hardwired in?;;
no but my pc is only getting 2mbps up;;
normally get 20;;
so my internet is screwed;;
hm;;
my in game pping has just hit 700;;
fuck it, im going to bed;;
Yeah reset your router or make sure nothing is up downloading in the background;;
tonight is not my night;;
Sometimes steam will open up and start updating games;;
its ps4. i dont have steam.;;
down speed is still over 40;;
Damn maybe ps network is down then?;;
Or having difficulties;;
who knows. im over it tonight;;
its 2.15am here;;
so im done;;
but ill be back tomorrow.;;
LD;;
üòÑ;;
I hardwire my ps4 just bc of that the integrated wifi sucks on ps4's;;
im too far away for hardwire;;
Iight man keep pushing  <@442488674144223242> and stay consistent you'll get there man;;
i need to get like a 10m cable;;
but even still, pc was getting way low on up speed so it wasnt ps4;;
now im getting 16 up;;
grrrr;;
ah well, in 14 hours ill be back on with the scavenger cups tournament;;
Yeah man that's what I did I got a huge cable to connect to my router directly bc I dont play no games...I mean I do play games but not...whatever you get my point lol;;
me too;;
i have a cable that's about 7 meters long;;
lol;;
hardwired is the way to go for sure;;
wifi is way too flakey;;
yeh, just that it will look shit running through the house;;
so i will have to put it away when not streaming;;
Great looking stream > great looking house all day;;
I have more online friends then I do irl friends lmfao;;
tbh this is the first time ive had issues with it since i had my net upgraded;;
hahahaah;;
true that <@217880977353998346>;;
hm.;;
it could just be your ISP;;
maybe htey were doing maintenance;;
i know here in brazil they do maintenance after 2am to avoid getting in people's way of using it;;
Yeah it is 2am they probably are doing server updates especially on the weekend;;
ive streamed this late before;;
who knows.;;
Yeah they probably pan it out for every other weekend or something or they could've had some issues and had to reboot a server or something;;
yeah, that's likely;;
ah well. shit happens;;
to be honest I think I'm more pissed at my play.;;
true. it happens. we all get tilted sometimes;;
it's best to take a break when that happens imo;;
Yeah man take a break for a day from streaming get all your thoughts straightened out do some editing some research and gomer back to it the next day;;
i did that the other day;;
I do it all the time i.e today in probably not gonna stream I'm just gonna network and test my Ps4 on elgato and get everything working right for RE7 tomorrow;;
re7;;
tomorrow I think I might start rise of the tomb raider;;
Resident Evil 7 I got 10 subs this week so I'm playing it in VR as promised to my fans;;
good luck <@217880977353998346>;;
youre gonna need an extra pair of pants;;
Nice;;
;;
nice. rise of the tomb raider is great;;
Oh hello;;
oooooooooooo;;
and <@448905820877488129> has just landed in the shade of the mango tree!;;
how are you doing my friend?;;
you are now a mango seed my dude. how does it feel?;;
thanks so much for joining and helping this tree grow into a colossus tree instead of withering away;;
Haha, happy to help man. Thanks for the invite!;;
<@488734758847905803> yeh I just finished the first tomb raider the other week;;
Next week I'm picking up Spider man uncharted lost legacy and Detroit become human;;
it's my pleasure to have ya!;;
if you have any questions <@448905820877488129> feel free to ask. most of the questions can be answered in the goals and rules;;
nice <@442488674144223242>;;
detroit become human is amazing;;
yeh I was impressed with the demo;;
and for my casual game Sunday nights I'm going to reinstall mortal Kombat and injustice gods among us;;
Nice! Hello everyone, hope y‚Äôall are doing well üòÉ;;
true that.;;
<@448905820877488129> I'm doing well, hbu?;;
what game is gonna get rekt by you today my dude?;;
Doing well, thanks! And red dead 2 until I beat it. I‚Äôm getting close but i have a feeling I still have a good amount left. I don‚Äôt mind though. Spyro will have to wait. You?;;
true that!;;
yeah, rdr2 is in my future till i beat it mostly;;
i do throwback thursday games, but other than that i play just one game till i beat it;;
congrats <@502171199850414081> on 11 viewers (or more) today!;;
what a great stream you had;;
as soon as you hit 50 you'll be an affiliate at this rate!;;
Thanks <@488734758847905803> yeah had a constant of 12 viewers it‚Äôs awesome !!! I had a great time today laughing a lot !! Hope people had a good time as well !!;;
i know whenever i popped by i laughed;;
your comments were hilarious;;
I m so glad you liked it <@488734758847905803> <:PurpleMMMANGO:499310401465352197>;;
üòÉ;;
;;
<@278571432588345345> welcome to the mango tree my Brazilian compatriot! Come chill in the shade and relax awhile. ;;
Thanks for helping this tree grow into absolutely colossus proportions!;;
;;
This is a self promotion friendly discord of course, so when you go live go ahead and post your link in the announcements tab;;
Any social media can be shared in the social media tab. ;;
And read up on binx if you don't know about it in the rules tab! It helps streamers A LOT;;
If you have any questions, just shoot me a message in dm or here even;;
awesome üòÉ;;
So don't forget to share that link so all the mango seeds can spam that follow button;;
;;
<@488734758847905803> ayyyyyy;;
what is up everyone? how is everyone's friday goin?;;
hey;;
pretty great and you?;;
goin good;;
just got my gamin chair all set up;;
and glad to hear everything is good <@278571432588345345>;;
awesome;;
are you also a streamer?;;
Hey hey hey <@481328139876827138> ! Welcome to the mango tree my bro! You are officially a mango seed, so come nap in the shade haha;;
Thanks so much for joining, it helps this tree grow instead of wither away haha;;
<@278571432588345345> I am;;
cool;;
what sort of stuff do you stream?;;
and <@488734758847905803> glad to be hear thank you üòÑ;;
I'll try to catch next time you're online;;
us streamers gotta stick together;;
<@278571432588345345> I use an elgato to stream off my ps4;;
That's right <@278571432588345345> !;;
Currently running obs studio as my main software and use StreamLabs for my alerts;;
<@278571432588345345> I appreciate ya and I will do the same;;
I use SLOBS OBS was using way more processor than SLOBS was so I like it a lot more;;
what is SLOBS OBS?;;
is that short for streamlabs?;;
SLOBS = StreamLabs OBS I meant to put a comma between SLOBS and OBS earlier sorry I'm at work I cant write good lol;;
Preach <@278571432588345345>;;
lol all good;;
I knew what you meant tho;;
I use OBS for recording and streaming;;
SLOBS brings up the chat and all your alerts on one page too along with a preview of your stream;;
you can add your alerts to OBS too;;
And if you use the link on my twitch page to download it I get a dollar üòâüòâ;;
i also have stream elements so on my OBS studio I have activity feed on the left and chat on the right;;
Im also considering on getting a tablet to read chat & watch stream, then minimize chat on obs so I have more gameplay;;
yeah that's what I do whenever streaming console;;
I only show messages from chat for a few seconds and then they fade out;;
keeps it contextualised;;
Is Johnny a killer like mike;;
ayyy <@374022856088092672> is in the chat;;
I‚Äôve been in the chat you bozo lolz jk;;
You know I love y‚Äôall;;
There are few things I have been excited for in the same way that I have been for the stream;;
Its so cool;;
joe I know you were kidding;;
I know but they might not of;;
true true;;
yeah literally a dream for me to be a streamer;;
years preparing tbh;;
Same, I think I streamed on my Xbox like two years ago or something lol;;
Didnt even have a computer and my mic didnt work;;
Actually I think it was three...oh my;;
Yeah, I always wanted to have some sort of channel myself for video games;;
"I was afraid at first because I didn't think I'd be ""different"" enough from other streamers";;
Like. Why watch me beat this game rather than someone else?;;
But on twitch the game almost becomes secondary at times. You build friendships and meet great people. And then people come back to see you;;
Mango layin down the truth bombs;;
Haha i try I try;;
Getting a follower is the best thing in the world;;
Fact check: true;;
Agreed;;
Especially that first follower that isn't a friend or relative;;
having someone come back and choose to spend their time on your stream is fantastic dude;;
You're just like;;
Whoa;;
Yeah for realz;;
and this sort of comradery on twitch I never really felt on YT;;
it's like a brotherhood, like we're all in it together;;
very cool;;
we don;t need to hug or anything tho;
I always say on my stream that it's hard to have free time, and for people to choose to spend it with me is humbling and awesome;;
Can I get an amen in the chat?;;
Hahahahahahahaha omg Jonn, I have to stop eating when I see you're typing;;
Amen!;;
hahaha;;
Don't forget to drop those Twitter links and other social media links in the respective tab so we all get updates on each other my friends;;
Got all new alerts, panels and overlays;;
Need to set everything up still;;
Nice!;;
I'll be sure to stop by and spam some later haha;;
Slobs would be one click setup but my SLOBS is buggy as hell and doesn‚Äôt show some alerts;;
My wife will be joining the discord in the near future to offer services in logo-making and personalized alerts!;;
I use OBS with streamelements addon;;
Powerful;;
She made my mango btw haha;;
Oh that sucks <@197049628451930112>   did you try resetting the code?;;
I tried everything;;
Damn;;
Slobs is great, it's what I use also;;
And labels also don‚Äôt update most of the time;;
At slobs;;
Sucks that I had to move on from slobs;;
The iPhone app is great;;
Using the remote function;;
Hm. Don't know about the remote function;;
You can remotely change scenes or turn on and off overlays with the slobs app on your phone;;
Very handy;;
Oh cool;;
Is it only for iOS?;;
Both;;
Android and iPhone;;
If you have transitions you can also set specific transitions if you go from a specific scene to another;;
At SLOBS;;
Not the phone app;;
Oh cool;;
I don't have transitions;;
Team spoc has a transition;;
What cool stuff do you guys have planned for the weekend?;;
Duke Davis can give it to you (stinger);;
work, hw, and stream lol;;
Same;;
Tomorrow I am throwing my belated bday party;;
Nice!;;
What games?;;
Because at my last stream I had like no viewers, marbles won‚Äôt be good xD;;
Playing with my balls alone is not good;;
Maybe a little bit Warface;;
Hahahaagag;;
Yeah marbles is only good when you have a recurring group of viewers imo;;
Im gonna be playing more Tarkov. Maybe some Fortnite off stream;;
Alright, I am live and I am trying something new!;;
Do you have a question for the Mango? 100 bits and you get to ask ANYTHING and I HAVE to answer truthfully! ;;
see you there!;;
@everyone;;
@everyone thank you guys SO much for coming by and chatting and lurking.;;
I really appreciate it so much, so so much.;;
i have no words for real ‚ù§;;
you guys are amazing;;
The mango tree has reached the goal of 20 subs this month, <@372392575547473920> was the 20th!;;
thank you guys so much. it means so much, for real!;;
‚ù§;;

Hey guys you know what today is?;;
Tactical Tuesday Battlefield 5 edition;;
thanks my dude ! <@374022856088092672>;;
nice <@434526286115897344> !!;;
Your all very welcome;;
Guys, I just want to give a disclosure as to why I only sub to one channel a month and why I dont give more bits / donations than I'd like to:;;
The currency here in Brazil is 4x less than the US dollar (it actually decreased a little since last month, so it's like 3.89) , but that doesnt mean we get 4x the wage, you know? it's not just a matter of converting, our currency is worth less here. To make that clear, I'll explain it this way: With $1 you can do more than with R$4 (brazilian currency).;;
So 1500 bits = R$74;;
oh my god!;;
so like donating 10k bits is workth almost 400$;;
Damn. Hey I appreciate all the McBits I get no matter what it is. Which means I am humbled and appreciative by the bits from <@488734758847905803> yesterday;;
yep <@235876529060446208>;;
thanks my dude! <@434526286115897344>;;
wow dude thats insane;;
there are two solutions for that situation:;;
I might b e leaving brazil, so then it'd be easier to do those things.;;
I want to be a full-time streamer, and if I make money in US dollars, that means I can give that back to the community and such;;
@everyone , question of the day:;;
What franchise did you expect a certain type of game that never came out?;;
For me, it'd be Star Wars and Pokemon. I would have loved an open world campaign style star wars and the same for pokemon.;;
bully 2;;
true that <@312590984037007361>;;
I had actually forgotten about that game haha;;
feelzbad;;
Alpha Protocol 2 and have be an open world cooperative stealth game;;
uuuuu;;
a coop stealth game would have been so cool;;
I guess that could still be made;;
I dont know about alpha protocol though;;
what system is it for?;;
Have you never played Knights of the old republic <@488734758847905803> ?;;
Yeah Alpha Protocol was a pretty cool stealth/action game for Xbox 360/PS3 era;;
I have only heard about it mostly <@217880977353998346>;;
Check around Christmas on steam it'll be like $5 for both of them 1 and 2 check them out they are amazing! <@488734758847905803>;;
nice!;;
thanks for that tip my dude;;
Like, when i was a kid in the super nintend era;;
I wanted to be luke freaking skywalker;;
doing the stuff from the movies;;
Alpha Protocol got NO play and they never made another one.;;
20 odd years after and im still waiting;;
oh damn...;;
It was good but that doesnt mean much if nobody plays it. XD;;
yeah.;;
I actually feel the same about Vandal Hearts;;
a ps1 game;;
they made 2 new games after that, but one was a prequel;;
and the other had nothing to do with the characters;;
I wanted a sequel to THOSE characters;;
Def Jam fight for NYC;;
oh yeah a sequel to that would have been dope;;
<@488734758847905803> there‚Äôs rumors that they‚Äôre making another;;
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT;;
I'd pre-order the most expensive version lol;;
From what I‚Äôve read they‚Äôre having DLC characters and each in game character has a story mode;;
nice;;
that'd be so cool;;
what is up everyone;;
Im officially on break.... whoop whooop;;
Me too;;

evening to ya;;
What‚Äôs up mango how has you been;;
hey mango. you missed another Yakuza stream;;
I've been good. worked so much the past 2 days, it was crazy. had to get some rest so i could stream today!;;
aw damn <@442488674144223242>;;
though i would probably get spoiled haha;;
hope you are enjoying the game thoug;;
though;;
yeh. story mode has just picked up now that the two characters stories are about to intertwine;;
nice;;
that sounds awesome;;
did you play the other yakuzas?;;
no this is the first one. The Net said it's the best one to start with;;
ive got Kiwami as well;;
which is a complete remake of the first Yakuza;;
ah true;;
yeah, i'm lpaying the first one, kiwami;;
since it was free with ps plus;;
i got both on sale a couple months ago for around 15 bucks aud reach;;
each;;
damn, must have missed that sale;;
WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME?!;;
haha;;
Australian psn store;;
usually the psn stores have universal sales;;
but I dont always check tbh;;
supposedly they are going to remake the first 4 Yakuza;;
yep;;
they already remade it in japan;;
next year 3 comes out in the west;;
Yakuza 5 was already ps4;;
2020 probs yakuza 4 will come out;;
I'll wait for them rather than going straight to 5 after Kiwami 2;;
yeah likewise probably;;
Good morning;;

let's get them their goals!;;
coolio;;
Thank you!;;
I have 44 followers üòÆ;;
can we get our mango seeds to 50 today?;;
I think jonny just needs the viewer average, i'm not sure;;
lemme check actually;;
yeah that's right;;
he just needs the viewer average;;
When he gets online, I will watch him then!;;
nice!;;
that's what it's all about;;
What do you do when you get to affiliate?;;
hm;;
what do you mean?;;
Like, to get the affiliate;;
ah;;
you need a viewer average of 3;;
and 50 followers;;
I have an average of 3.5 if I am not mistaken;;
oh cool!;;
then all you need is those 6 followers;;
Lol;;
<@488734758847905803>  thank you for being in the stream showing that love and support, super hyped we are 7 follows away from my 200 follower goal.;;

Omg thank you!;;

Oh nevermind lol;;
It is the first on the self promote!;;
Followed üëçüèº;;
Thank you so much!;;
<@502171199850414081> how many do you need?;;
19;;
Followed <@342754022526025731>;;
all right;;
let's see if we can't get you those 19 follows today;;
I wish lol !! But it would be amazing üòâ;;
What's your channel?;;
i just posted <@502171199850414081> 's channel in self promote;;
Aww thanks a lot <@488734758847905803> you are so sweet !!;;
Followed!;;
Thank you so so much !!;;
I would follow again lol;;
Aww you are so sweet <@342732640815677453> thanks a lot !!;;
<@342732640815677453> what about your twitch account?;;
Its just GoldCast. Link is in the profile here on discord ‚ò∫;;
Followed :3;;
Thanks man! I appreciate it;;
<@278571432588345345> I think the extension takes a cut from the bits when you use them right?;;
I didn't see any of that but not sure;;
I think they take 20%;;
Of each bit;;
But they encourage people to give more bits imo;;
So it's kind of a win win;;
What extension is this?;;
There are a few different ones that work with twitch;;
Jonny posted one of them up above in the chat;;
Oh the schedule. Yea, I like that one. I had it but removed it yesterday until I actually have a schedule lol;;
So using it gives them a cut?;;
Extentions like, the ones available to only affiliate right?;;
Actually I'm wrong;;
That extension does not take bits;;
Omg this discord app is so bad;;
Had to resend my message like 5 times before it went through;;
I hate when that happens!;;
There are extensions that take bits wheb people give you them;;
Which ones?;;
Me too haha;;
I have to check when I get home. I'll send links;;
Ok thank you!;;
But there are some where they encourage your viewers to give bits because you beat a boss or something;;
Btw, when you get affiliate, you will stay affiliate for ever?;;
No;;
You have to keep that 3 viewer average;;
For 30 days, right?;;
Every month;;
Hope I will be able to keep it. I have been doing pretty well thanks to hosts but if not for that it'd be rough;;
As you reach affiliate and stuff you tend to maintain that average;;
At least that's what I've been seeing;;
Ups I joined the voice chat xd;;
Also, if you watch your own channel from your phone or navigator;;
You count yourself as a viewer;;
Really?;;
Even if it's the same account;;
Yep;;
But you can't mute the player;;
Like. You can't mute the sound bar;;
You can mute your phone or pc;;
Just not the app video player;;
https://www.twitch.tv/ext/categories/de82d4e2-591d-4ec0-998d-71d0f48886c9 - these are the extensions that take a cut from your bits;;
Like, they cut if you earn bits with that right?;;
The sounds alerts to be activated you need to give bits;;
So I get it that it can cut;;
But it doesn't cut the bits that you gain without the sound alerts, right?;;
um...;;
i actually didnt compeletly understand your question to be honest, but i havent read the whole description of the extensions;;
what I understood is that there's one that encourages viewers to give you bits if you beat a boss, f or example;;
Ok, to use sound alerts, you need to give bits;;
or you did something without dying;;
On that list there's sound alerts;;
They work, like I said, by giving bits;;
You give bits, you get a sound alert;;
https://www.twitch.tv/ext/cmi61jubp5da29bxs6xu36te4rdhaj-0.0.2;;
like this one;;
Game Event Clips uses Overwolf Events to create Clips for in-game events during your stream and presents them together with Clips created by you or your viewers. This provides an easy way to replay your greatest moments and for your viewers to give Kudos for your Clips with Bits!;;

"Btw guys, I am thinking of doing a ""stream"" of 1 minute at midnight to just see if I can get the 7 days streaming achievement, do you think it will work?";;
probably;;
<@319840437051326464> probably not they are pretty particular with the requirements I feel but wouldn't hurt to try;;
what <@217880977353998346> said also makes sense lol;;
Also depends on your timezone vs theirs;;

Well, I am a student and I can't find a job;;
;;
Hey üòÉ;;
New person!;;
i may have been a bit quiet here. hello everyone üòÑ;;
Hey üòÑ;;
Thank you for following Nyllla!;;

hey <@278571432588345345> just feeling bored at the office. hows it going with you?;;
fantastic, also working but it's friday!;;
i usually stream evenings on weekdays. long ones from the morning on weekends üòÑ;;
exactly the same for me;;
except for fridays, since I usually am tied in the acg podcast till late;;
aside from that been trying to have a set schedule;;
ahhh i see. you're in the States?;;
no Im based in London;;
yeah i cant set a schedule atm so streams are pretty much impromptu;;
oh nice. i'm in London too;;
oh cheers;;
dropped you a follow;;
thank you. i'll drop a follow as well;;
so if I see you online when Im done streaming Ill host you with a few people;;
not a ton but every bit counts right;;
every host matters üòÑ;;
what games do you play btw?;;
right now doing fallout 76 with some of the ACG folks;;
I did red dead on the channel and will be doing nioh or bloodbourne next;;
ah i see. that's cool;;
Ah ah <@319840437051326464> look at that;;
OMG;;
HOW DID I MISS THAT?;;
I laughed so hard;;
Like a bad kid happy because he did a nasty thing lool;;
Did you kill anyone?;;
good morning @everyone ! how are you all doing? have a great friday and an even better weekend mango seeds.;;
welcome to the mango tree <@322447030565863424> ! come chill in its shade as a mango seed ;;
how are you doing my friend?;;
hey <@502171199850414081> , what game is that message from?;;
Hey <@488734758847905803> this is from cod bo4;;
evening mango;;
ah true true;;
hey there zorbacles;;
Hey üòÉ;;
hey miguel, how are ya?;;
Good what about you?;;
You are still streaming Nylllaa!;;
Yes just having quick lunch and coming back;;
Oh ok!;;
im doing well also;;
hahaha;;
that's awesome;;
i need to eat something soon too actually;;
woke up in zombie mood;;
mode*;;
<@488734758847905803> do you have cod?;;
I dont;;
I am not good at shooter games;;
and i dont really like them that much tbh haha;;
i do have destiny 2, and i did have fun with it, but not enough to warrant a purchase of a game like that;;
i prefer singleplayer campaign games;;
or co-op campaign games;;
do you have cod <@319840437051326464> ?;;
I don't;;
But I'm thinking of buying it;;
true.;;
I think it's kind of expensive for a gaame without a campaign. but that's just my opinion;;
Why people are bad to me !?;;
Can‚Äôt I just play game without all the nasty messages ??;;
What happened <@502171199850414081>;;
<@502171199850414081> Look away look away look away Lucifer.;;
A douchebag asked me in whisper if I wanted to see his cock and if I like them big !? What is wrong with people ???;;
I reported him hoping they will do something;;
They should. I'm so sorry! That's really messed up nylllaa;;
what if it was sarcastic, and you reported someone for bad humor?;;
That's not something to joke about;;
I think I would have been able to understand sarcasm but anyway this is not what you joke with someone you don‚Äôt know ?;;
good morning;;
Morning <@459504171113250837>;;
It definently is som strong stuff yes, but that makes it only more tempting to joke about.;;
Not to me <@351323158826975232>;;
HULLUH deadpool;;
You always have a pretty off color sense of humor;;
I only joke like that even close to friends;;
<@235876529060446208> Why take something serious and get disgusted when you can take it as a joke, and not be.;;
Because it's not a joking matter that's why;;
Guess I should have keep my mouth closed and again;;
It is still not a strictly nice thing to say. And yes, an edgy joke at best.;;
Nylllaa I don't blame you for reporting it's messed up you did the right thing;;
Just don‚Äôt wanna be a drama queen that‚Äôs all;;
<@502171199850414081> I do agree with warman. The important thing is your own view on the situation.;;
drama isn't always bad, Like now it lead to a discussion.;;
I m pretty open minded but this guy just asked me when I started play bo4 then he wanted to play but couldn‚Äôt stand up because his mom‚Äôs friend were home and he had a ¬´¬†huge case of morning wood and no way to hide it¬†¬ª and asked if I wanted a picture ...;;
I really don't think that was sarcasm;;
and it's not ok to joke about that;;
it's virtual sexual harassment and I'm glad you reported him <@502171199850414081>;;
I'm sorry that happened to you;;
women in general have to go through this kind of bs all the time, and it feels like it happens even more so on gaming platforms / communities;;
It‚Äôs ok just really surprised me that they could do it on twitch;;
I mean, he can't really. I think / hope they'll do something;;
but he can just make another account, which is what really sucks;;
on brighter news,;;
<@342754022526025731> crushed his 200 follower goal and had an 11+ hour stream that just absolutely killed it!;;
congratulations Reptar!!;;
Krisp news indeed;;
haha nice pun;;
<@502171199850414081> how r u;;
Doing ok ty just had a good time on bo4 first time play I killed 2 people in a game and been 3rd in another !! Could have been worse !! What about you ???;;

What about Brazillian cuisine, how is that to your likeing;;
oh i love it;;
it's awesome;;
there's a fish stew called moqueca;;
it has dogfish (shark), bell peppers, coconut milk, sometimes plantain;;
it's sooooo good;;
the spices here are awesome too;;
there are so many recipes, but i'm hungry and all i can think of now is moqueca;;
sounds delicious to a hungary heart;;
oh, but i know there's a steak here that doesnt exist in other places - it's called Picanha;;
they dont use that cut in the US;;
what part of the ox?;;
i think it's the shoulder. lemme check;;

thanks for joining, it means a lot;;
thanks;;
i guess;;
no sauce though <@351323158826975232> ;;

of course!;;

That's some creepy stuff <@351323158826975232> sounds like you're going to invoke the anti-mango hahaha;;
Good morning mango seeds! Hope you're all doing well.;;
What are ya streaming <@216717411645259777> ?;;
What about you <@278571432588345345> ? You streaming?;;

Feels great to have so many wonderful people in here;;
doing some more bloodborne what about you guys?;;
'amori maius ab lux' : light from a greater love. The rest is supposed to be something about the shade of a mango tree... (If google translate is a good source for latin speechcraft.);;
And Jonny, feelzbad for gr√™mio this year hahsha;;
I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôll play tomorrow on stream.;;
How‚Äôs Brazil <@488734758847905803>;;
Hm. Brazil is awesome, in terms of the people I've met here. But the financial and political situation is getting a bit out of hand. We  (wife and I) might be leaving here. It's just tough because of family and friends who can't leave;;
What about Norway?;;
<@488734758847905803>  I'm streaming some good 'ol RESONANCE OF FATE today! lol;;
NICE;;
I dont know that game hahaha;;
but if youre playing it im sure it's awesome;;
feeling better today <@197881756844556288> ?;;
no, feeling worse;;
woke up with a 101.4 temp;;
WHOA;;
That's no good;;
yeah, feeling pretty crappy;;
Oh damn. That sucks;;
I feel like Mondays are cursed for me. I am not going to be able to stream today again.;;
Afternoon everyone;;
Hey there Deadpool!;;
*blows a kiss to everyone* have a good end of day guys !! My time is up I go to sleep üõè  night;;
Gnite!;;
Good night <@502171199850414081> !;;
holy crap today was insane everyone.;;
i didnt stop at home for a second basically;;
i had a ton of stuff to do;;
couldnt even believe it;;
i'll try to make up for it tomorrow though;;
sorry to hear Mr. Mango;;
it's all good Clopt.;;
where did you come up with that name btw?;;
honestly, needed an xbox live gamertag and Clopt came to mind;;
literally random thought;;
Hahahaha that is awesome;;
Your random thoughts are like equivalent or better than my concentrated ones;;
My first twitch name was letsplay_deligi;;
Guess how many people pronounced it right?;;
PSN user was ozzy4life49;;
does anyone usually stream at 10pm UTC?;;
I finish my streams at that time and looking for more people I can raid üòÉ;;
What is this UTC?;;
There is only EST;;
UTC is greenwich time;;
it's the baseline all other timezones are based upon;;
lol;;
just apply shift rule and you find that both could be the baseline for all other timezones.;;
jesus whatever man;;
just look up the timezone and use the one you prefer lol;;
The fact that we are even talking about this is unacceptable. EST is the only time zone;;
You are 5 hours ahead of me????;;
yes Im from the future üòõ;;
Future is awesome !! Lol;;
It‚Äôs like I can look behind me and waves at you <@342732640815677453> !!;;
However hey guys !!! How‚Äôs @everyone doing ?!;;
I just finished my door decoration for Christmas and I did it all myself !!;;
good morning;;
Woah good work looks great;;
Good morning!;;
good morning Mango Seeds!;;
<@502171199850414081> that looks great! What is it made of?;;
yeah, <@278571432588345345> and Nylllaa are from the far future, I'm from the semi future;;
and the US is in duh past;;
lol;;
and <@442488674144223242> is from the super future, he's in Australia;;
Sorry I haven't been around so much these past 4 days;;
some IRL stuff happened and needed taking care of;;
what up <@372392575547473920> ?;;
hey deadpool;;
lol 10.5 hours ahead of gmt;;
yeah that's crazy haha;;
Yeah, that's about the boat I fell in to as well. Had some unexpected irl shit pop up. But other than that, I've been doing pretty good;;
I started with a piece of polystyrene (is that the English word ?) and I made the rest ... added layers of green crepe paper then painted and added the little wood pieces;;
NOCE;;
Hey guys üòÑ;;
Hey hey <@319840437051326464>;;
Does anyone have a good playlist on spotify that I can listen to?;;
hope you sorted it all out <@372392575547473920> , good to hear you have been good aside from that.;;
ohhh that's cool <@502171199850414081> ! you did real good work.;;
hey <@319840437051326464>;;
depends on what kind of music you like;;
if you like calm instrumental stuff there's a playlist called chill instrumental beats;;
I made a playlist that has quite a bit of instrumental stuff, but it's not all super relaxed. I called it writing juice;;
Sorry <@278571432588345345> I‚Äôm not gonna be on st that time outside of weekends;;
st? <@193534318704852993>;;
"i think he meant ""at""";;

ooh ok <@488734758847905803>;;
@everyone question of the day:;;
 if you could only eat one dish for the rest of your life, what would that dish be?;;
for me:;;
White rice, beans, mashed potatoes, grilled plantains, grilled chicken and... damn there's something that I like eating but i can't remember;;
fine, just those things;;
A hamburger with all the basics on it üçî, broccoli, and some good French fries with sweet tea  (lol I love my food choices);;
nice choice;;
D√ñNER!;;
made me gunfry;;
hungry;;
damn my greasy fingers;;
üçîüçîüçîüçî;;
Here I brought you a burger <@488734758847905803> üòÇ;;
nice haha;;
thanks;;
does it have pickles?;;
I've had mango on a burger before;;
It's fantastic;;
A nice thin mango slice adds a lot of flavors;;
Mango on a burger? What is this heresy? Where did you get one?;;
Nice. I've had pineapple slices on burgers. That's awesome too. I have to try mango on a burger;;
Hahaa. Don't burn us at the stake <@343707181377388544> , please!;;
Been in the hamburger business over 23 years .  Have had pineapple not bad, but most people aren't  adventurous when it comes to food. Was actually wondering what came on this mango burger?;;
oh nice;;
true true;;
hey <@323618354701271041> ! what came on that burger?;;
I dont remember exactly, i was a basic burger that came with a mango slice instead of cheese;;
and a slice of watermelon instead of fries or sides;;
it was good;;
worth trying!;;
Fascinating(!);;
Thanks for hanging out <@502171199850414081> üòÉ;;
Np it was really fun I had a great time !!! <@278571432588345345>;;

happy friday mango seeds!;;
what up <@474330976538066984> and <@278571432588345345> ?;;
man, i gotta tell ya, this week was not easy haha. i slept way too little and worked way too much. However, this time of the year is always like this, and soon I will have nothing to do haha. In a way, it's good to sell yourself for a short period of time to your work, because then you appreciate things like sleep again lol;;
how was your week dude?;;
did you finish your work yesterday <@488734758847905803> ?;;
I finished yesterday's work, but a short file came by today, so I am doing that.;;
but after that i am denying EVERYTHING;;
I have to get ready for the podcast too though later;;
are you joining us today again?;;
yep;;
i'm stoked;;
i wish i could be at a tier yearlong where i could be on the podcast at least 1-2 times a month;;
I'm in scrub tier on patreon haha;;
haha;;
how long have you been a patreon for?;;
a year I think;;
I started last year i think, but i was only giving 1dollar for a while;;
TRUE;;
I didnt even know about his discord till i was checking out the tiers one day;;
btw, have you checked out twin peaks yet jonny?;;
Good morning mango seeds!!;;
no, I haven't;;
what up <@323618354701271041> ?;;
too much stuff I do, usually only have time for one show at a time;;
yeah i know the feeling;;
it's all good, i was just checking;;
Chillen. Waiting for a contractor to show up. Hanging in the nice warm car. How about you?;;
nice.;;
I am doing the last few hours of work that i have to do before taking a 3-day break that i much deserve hahah;;
i never went this long without streaming;;
Good morning guys;;
how are the streams going <@459504171113250837>;;
<@278571432588345345> it was good. Had to cut my stream short;;

pimp;;
lmao <@278571432588345345>;;
them girls got me running in circles to get me paid;;
lol jk of course;;
I am a translator (portuguese - english and vice versa);;
I do a lot of work for marketing research nowadays;;
so campaigns that come to brazil, studies for international companies to grow in brazil / translate advertisements from abroad so they can be shown here, all that stuff, is what I do;;
i see the discussion groups that go down before a product launches or an ad launches;;
Good morning @everyone and Happy Friday. I sincerely apologize for yesterday shit in IRL came up last minute. But tonight I will be streaming just not sure what game yet. Starting time is at 7pm EST;;
no probs <@434526286115897344> !;;

I'm happy to be here./;;
anytime man.;;
so, tell us about what you do, what games you made and if youre working on anything!;;
I write / develop vulgar comedy rpg's with southpark like humor. I've released 5 games so far with a 6th coming out in a few days. They're currently all on Steam but by the end of the year will also be on google play for android devices. I'm currently working on a VERY large project. A new Metal as Phuk game that's planned to be about 20-30 hours long or so. Other than that, I'm tossing around the idea of making a new project to include thousands of people on twitter / other social medias.;;
Still in early stages of planning for that one, but I'll know soon.;;
that's awesome!;;
you can drop the steam link in here for those who are intersted;;
btw @everyone - i got the bundle that comes with all of his games;;
i haven't played them yet, but i've seen some screen shots and reviews and they look awesome and hilarious;;
I would post a link myself, but since i'm in brazil, it'll probably bring up a link that you guys can't open. though i'm not sure;;
https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/7659/The_Terrible_Metal_as_Phuk_Deported_Tale_of_Damned_Daniel_Chronicles_of_Quiver_Dick_Collection_Bundle/;;
Thank you very much üòÑ;;
It really does mean a lot, it's not always easy getting that support so thank you.;;
there it is guys;;
yeah, getting support is def not easy. That's why I like helping people, not just with streaming / channels etc;;
but in life in general;;
feels good to help people;;
and if no one helped each other, eveyrone would just be on their own;;
‚ù§;;
I‚Äôm about to get super smash Bros ultimate like (maybe) some of you. If you want to add me as a friend on Nintendo (I have none at the moment) then feel free to message me;;
<@448905820877488129> I wish I had a switch haha. I'd add you for sure. ;;

MB;;
Really happy for you <@488734758847905803>;;
afternoon all;;
Afternoon my people's;;
Good afternoon @everyone how‚Äôs the day treating ya so far. I want to apologize for not being around lately. I‚Äôve been battling depression a lot this past week. But hopefully everything will work out.;;
It‚Äôs ok <@434526286115897344> I know how that feels. It‚Äôs why I stopped twitch streaming for like a year and half until recently;;
I also faced that shit and it can be brutal;;
but it's something that can be overcome;;
Hey @everyone !;;
Just got back from the trip. It was awesome, as I expected. I am gonna hop in the shower and get back into the groove tomorrow. ;;
;;
<@434526286115897344> , dude I think it's part of being an adult. Depression is tough, but the bright side is we evolve and grow every time we overcome it. Remember that your feelings are valid, even if people tell you you have nothing to be upset or angry or whatever about. There are reasons for you to feel what you do. It's important to remember that. ;;
If you ever need to talk or vent, just send me a dm and we can talk for however long you want;;
This goes for absolutely anyone who wants to talk about anything. I care about everybody and like helping anyone who just needs to talk! I am a good listener <3;;
Also thanks for being happy for me <@193534318704852993>;;
Wassup;;
How‚Äôs everyone doing happy Monday :/;;
not the best monday for me, but surviving hehe;;
excited for another week of streaming;;
GOOOOOOOOD  afternoon everyone;;

hey there <@474330976538066984> ! how are ya?;;
this monday has kicked my ass a bit so far lol;;
but i will be streaming in about an hour or so;;
don't know which game i should play though;;
any suggestions;;
?;;
did you finish red dead <@488734758847905803> ?;;
Is red dead online similar kinda to Gta online in the aspect of it being a rockstar game ?  Where u earn money and lvl up etc;;
It‚Äôs suppose to be <@436313570926395407>;;
I did <@278571432588345345>;;
on friday, but i didnt stream it;;
in that sense, it is <@436313570926395407>;;
Ok, that the knot reason I‚Äôd buy it tbh it not one for solo story modes, I only ever did 5 mission on story mode in GTA VüòÇüòÇ;;
lmao;;
what did you think of the epilogue ending?;;
I thought it was amazing;;
yeah, it was awesome;;
especially since i didnt play rdr1;;
so i didnt know a lot of info that people who had knew;;
it did get a bit slow, the gameplay i mean;;
but the story was great for sure;;
yeah it was very long;;
yeah;;
but it was fun overall;;
i am going to try online mode later;;
but for now i am going to dive into god of war;;
i am near the end, but never got around to finishing it;;

I am currently playing Batman Arkham Knight;;
God Of War is so good man <@488734758847905803>;;
Souns great !;;

I gotta buy the battle pass for this season <@448648678224429068>;;
NIce <@!450002701904773132>, you just advanced to level 1!;;
how about you <@87241615671832576> ?;;
what game is on your play list?;;
true that <@448648678224429068>;;
all about dem shooters;;
I would get BOPS 4;;
There‚Äôs some cool stuff on there;;
But idk if I wanna go through the headache of learning the game lol;;
Dude blackout is way better then fortnite;;
Still trying to finish Yakuza 0 and I want to find something neat to dive into. But nothing to time consuming;;
Still on the Overwatch wagon;;
haha i suck at shooters, but i have fun with them occasionally <@450002701904773132>;;
true true;;
i started playing my first yakuza game a few weeks back;;
I need more people that stream on ps4 that plays the same games;;
loved it;;
did you get hitman <@87241615671832576> ?;;
true that <@448648678224429068> ;;
there are some people in here who play bo4;;
I did üòÉ And I thin I'll be playing it some more. When I just need to relax;;
All of my streaming buddies play nothing but fortnite;;
NIce <@!448648678224429068>, you just advanced to level 2!;;
Did someone say..... Overwatch üòè;;
true that;;
hahahaha;;
i try to avoid those kinds of games because they suck me in;;
i love story games;;
Funny thing Overwatch can have a story mode;;
Idk why it don't;;
true that;;
I usually set up a multi-stream whenever I‚Äôm playing with someone that is streaming;;
hmm;;
They quit the story, when they abandoned Titan, so they just polished the PVP mode in.;;
NIce <@!87241615671832576>, you just advanced to level 1!;;
But I'd be happy to see some more Coop modes in Overwatch;;
oh i didnt know that;;
i feel blizzard has a hard time balancing games as of late;;
Yeah;;
Like;;
Give Bastion 600 bullets in sentry mode and a 1200 shield while in Sentry Mode;;
#BastionLivesMatter;;
lol;;
Overwatch is in a pretty good spot right now. But I'd love to see them make a better ranking system;;
hmm;;
But I am primarily playing tohave fun;;
I‚Äôve never played overwatch;;
I play to have fun too <@87241615671832576>;;
But I can't get any credit when I play Bastion lol;;
Ahh I play the bastion, when it makes sense. He's quite situational, but soooo fun;;
I get kinda competitive with games like that tbh haha;;
too competitive to have fun lol;;
Im competitive no matter what so I can‚Äôt really play story modes;;
lol;;
i dont get competitive with story modes actually;;
Playing against bots isn‚Äôt as fun for me I‚Äôd rather play against other people;;
TRUE;;
I;ve always liked the stories in general though;
i guess for shooters it doesnt make as much sesne;;
Yeah that‚Äôs all I play except for rocket league and I haven‚Äôt played it in a while;;
TRUE;;
NIce <@!488734758847905803>, you just advanced to level 4!;;
I get competitive in almost all pvp modes, but it tends to go a while before I go all nuts :) Except rocket league, I am already tilting on the way into the first game.;;
There will be a couple times this month I will be doing big streams trying to reach my biggest goal right now;;
So I do not play it;;
nice ncie <@448648678224429068> ;;
oh true <@87241615671832576> haha;;
i get angrier at my team than the opponents team in rocket league lo;;
l;;
I‚Äôm not very good at rocket league but I have fun playing it;;
I'd wish I had the fun. But sometimes you just need to admit defeat :);;
True true lol;;
right;;
all of my streaming today is going to be factorio;;
hahaahah;;
yeah <@87241615671832576>;;
do you play on ps4 or pc?;;
mango come type in my chat once and see if anything is different;;
i fixed my fallacy;;
I only have a pc and some old consoles.;;
ah true true;;
Anytime I play escort payloads or capture the point on certain maps I'm getting POTG at least 85% of the time lmao;;
I‚Äôm at work now will be back later;;
I don't really get that, but I also suck at the game :);;
<@450002701904773132> SOME of us actually have to work for our POTG's;;
NIce <@!216717411645259777>, you just advanced to level 1!;;
HEY HEY HEY;;
I work just as hard as any guy on our team not my fault everybody try to kill me;;
THIS guy;;
All I ask is for 600 bullets and a 1200 shield in sentry mode;;
LOL;;
I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT;;
I'm not asking for much;;
You got Reaper with flipping health Regen when he shoots you;;
When....... He....... Shoots you;;
I don't have that luxury;;
All I want is an inviz with no minimum range for approach, an invincible relocater, and 0 spread on the machinegun for Sombra. Is that so much to ask for?;;
That's asking too much;;
She's already OP running around invisible all damn day;;
What's one or 3 more buffs?;;
I gotta go straight up Hero Of Middle Earth to get a POTG lol;;
üòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
I gotta pull a miracle out my ass to get POTG sir you got it easy üòè;;
NIce <@!450002701904773132>, you just advanced to level 2!;;
I‚Äôm lost now;;
"The miracle is called ""Bastion being greenlit to be in Overwatch""";;
nice <@450002701904773132> !;;
lmao <@216717411645259777>;;
Lol, I guess Bastion vs. Reaper. Rock vs. Scissors;;
Reaper can sneak up on Bastion and make him panic;;
Most (including me) Bastion players don't know how to leave their area;;
Reapers and Genji love Bastions who don't know how to move around;;
That's true, I like him and I wonder if the new 35 clip mag in his scout configuration will make him a bit steonger;;
Speaking of which I am streaming some Overwatch now if you guys wanna watch ;;

Fairly new in the streaming scene;;
What does Stream Lab do for streams?;;

Depends on what part of stream labs you're talking about. ;;
If it's stream labs obs, then there's a lot it can do for you;;
Do you stream directly from your console or do you have a capture card?;;
If you have a capture card, stream labs can organize your alerts and stuff;;
I stream directly from my console at the moment;;

Yeah we loved it there. Wish it was easier for Americans to live in different countries. We wanna do 5 years in Europe. Thanks <@488734758847905803> !!!;;
Same for us Europeens to come to USA to be honest nothing is easy;;
Yeah but you dont wanna come here lol! My grandmother was born in Germany so I may have a chance there;;
Where are you in USA ? If I can ask of course because yeah I always said that I wasn‚Äôt fit to live in France lol that‚Äôs a shame to you I guess huh but it‚Äôs the way I feel;;
I need to cook dinner ... any idea to help me @everyone ?!;;
I am currently in Los Angeles California. My fiance and I would fit in so well in Europe lol. I am applying for dual citizenship in Germany soon. I speak the language pretty well so hopefully that and my Grandmothers citizenship will be enough;;
NIce <@!416803598173995018>, you just advanced to level 3!;;
What are you in the mood for dinner wise?;;
Yay level 3!;;
A meal not a soup lol;;
Well what do you have in your house to cook?;;
Think I found it. In France we call that Saucisses lentilles if you can figure out what it looks like good luck !! Hahah;;
c'est pas mal! My French is rough so that might be wrong lol;;
What's up mango seeds. Sorry I haven't been active lately, just started a new job and my wife and I are moving tomorrow;;
No it‚Äôs perfect !!! <@416803598173995018> all fine;;

Ohhhh nice too lol you all are little franchie !!;;
Thank you <@502171199850414081> it is ridiculously stressful right now;;
<@372392575547473920> just dropped you a follow!;;

Yeah Saucisses lentilles here it‚Äôs in the oven thank you !! I wanted Chinese food but meh ... can‚Äôt so had to find another idea;;
I see. I can't say I've ever had that. I assume it's made with lentils?;;
Exactly and special sausages;;
That sounds good. I have a bag of lentils in my pantry I just haven't looked up any recipes for them lol;;
You should look for the recipe of Saucisses lentilles you should find similar sausages where you are it‚Äôs easy and delicious;;
I'll definitely have to do that. I'm always looking for new recipes. I'm a chef lol;;

Woo level 1;;
You are a chef omg I respect people who make other happy with food;;
That's what it's all about for me;;
It‚Äôs awesome and creativity is needed ... but respect because most of time when they know it everyone around is asking a chef to cook on dinners or party because they know what they do ... but sometimes chef needs a break !!;;
Hey I work with food too! I am an account manager for a catering company. Stressful line of work food service is lol;;

hey <@448648678224429068> ;;
good morning my dude, have a nice day at work!;;
We got a crew coming in to wash all week so it will be easy work for me lol <@488734758847905803>;;
nice, you deserve a break;;
Working them banker hours;;
yep lmao;;
Money sucks though when you do that hopefully before long I figure out if I get my new position and a raise;;
why does money suck when you do htat?;;
i dont understand haha;;
Not working enough hours we‚Äôve only been working 4 hours a day;;
ah true;;
i understand;;
i thought you were saying the opposite;;
me dumb sometime;;
@everyone - if you could say one thing to a game developer, who would it be, and what would you say?;;
it could be a suggestion, a criticism, anything;;
Lol nah I didn‚Äôt make it very understandable at first;;
<@488734758847905803> I‚Äôd have to go with the makers of call of duty and tell them to get their heads out of their behinds and fix the way it is played and fix the servers so you can join friends;;
true that! i've heard thousands of complaints about that;;
I would tell rockstar games that they are the ones who made games a passion for me and my childhood ;);
that's awesome <@312590984037007361> ;;
which game of theirs was your first?;;
I was gonna say a hate comment to bethesda first but im tryna be optimistic lol;;
Erm;;
Gta 2;;
oh nice!;;
i actually didnt play gta 2;;
hahaha, im curious to hear what you would say to them actually haha;;
I started way early when i was like 3 because of my older bro;;
ah true;;
Id say to bethesda to stop fucking around and make proper games xD;;
hahaahha;;
straightforward, i like it;;
GTA has a lot of stuff to fix as well;;
NIce <@!448648678224429068>, you just advanced to level 7!;;
online you mean right?;;
Yeah;;
i actually deleted rdr2 after finishing all the single player stuff;;
Don‚Äôt blame it;;
i dont even want to get into it if it's such a crazy grind;;
O I know;;
hahah;;
GTA is the same;;
TRUE;;
i also have never played gta online;;
I lived not Gta 5 online I‚Äôm lvl 200 sum then I found fortnite üòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
Lived on *;;
I think the best game to grind on is gotta be call of duty story modes;;
Same here <@436313570926395407>;;
lmao true true;;
If I knew people would stick in my stream that‚Äôs what I would play;;
honestly, i feel most people dont watch streams because of the game itself;;
i might be wrong;;
i mean, i guess thats how i find people sometimes;;
but in general, when i see a streamer i like;;
i watch them no matter what theyre playing;;
Yeah I just don‚Äôt have any games that small streamers can grow on lol;;
which games do you have?;;
i am playing god of war and getting decent flow of new people;;
GTA V call of duty fortnite rocket league absolver;;
hm....;;
no ps plus ? there were some decent free games not too long ago;;
Yeah I got ps plus I just don‚Äôt look at the games in there lol I actually forgot about them;;
oh damn really?;;
last month was yakuza remaster;;
dude the free games are awesome sometimes;;
this month theyre kinda meh from what i remember;;
I just got a racing game off of it lol;;
<@488734758847905803> god of war is epic man, my 2nd fav game this year, i didnt know u were streaming it;;
ill tune in next time;;
I have god of war but idk how to play it;;
nice <@448648678224429068> ;;
thanks <@312590984037007361> ! I appreciate it. Yeah, i streamed rdr2 then went back to god of war;;
after taht I'll be going back to spiderman;;
god of war i think was my 2nd fav as well;;
losing only to rdr2;;
but it's a bit unfair haha;;
because I like the old-west genre;;
but the story and even the gameplay of god of war are more up my alley;;
My highest view count was on absolver so I‚Äôm going to have to say that was my  1st then probably rocket league;;
true true;;
the game i got the highest views was outlast 2 hahaha;;
people love seeing others shit their pants i gues;;
Lol absolver got me affiliate. They have a free game for ps4 I might get it and see how my views do;;
nice;;
just remember to play what you like and be yourself. youre a great guy, people will come back to watch you specifically;;
TRUE;;
Gotta go to work now chat later;;
alright my dude;;
have a nice day at work;;
Thanks;;
<@488734758847905803> nope still got 2 kids to go this weekend lmao;;
And just when I thought I was free from overtime.... I got 12 hour shifts for the rest of the week;;
ah damn;;
ah damn x2;;
I‚Äôm back;;
How is one supposed to grow on a game that always has less than 1k watching at any time;;
And they ppl they watch are the ones who‚Äôs spend hundreds buying card packs;;
Good morning ‚òÄÔ∏è;;
Whats up everyone? How were your weekends?;;
Morning, the sun is shining;;
Morning mango family;;
<@436313570926395407> , i actually feel like those games are sometimes  the best to grow;;
because people want to talk to the streamer, they want to interact;;
they dont want a streamer with 1k viewers;;
hey <@416803598173995018>;;
pretty good, hb yours?;;
hey <@508094590436507668> , youre not kidding about the sun;;

I CANT WAIT FOR MY 1070ti to get here;;
noice;;
I'm good;;
Currently running a crap gt1030;;
Cant wait to get a PC. Hopefully by the end of next year I'll have one;;
same;;
You got this man;;
Yo yo;;
Hey @everyone, was hoping someone could help me with a problem I have. When I stream CoD my viewers say they can barely hear my voice over the game sounds. Any way to adjust the levels? I'm on PS4, thanks!;;
I definitely will;;
<@416803598173995018> go to you setting on your ps4 and turn your mic up without being at home I can‚Äôt really explain it any better;;
<@448648678224429068>  thanks! I'll do this when I get home later. Appreciate it;;
You streaming from your console or using a capture card <@416803598173995018>;;
If you have any other problem just send me a dm <@416803598173995018>;;
from console right now and thanks for the offer!;;
Not a problem that‚Äôs what I stream from so I know what your dealing with;;
Ahh ok, eventually I'll get a capture card or just upgrade to PC but that costs money so thats far off lol;;
Yeah I‚Äôm in the process of having a pc built;;
That's awesome! Definitely my goal for next year;;
Yeah it‚Äôs going to run $1800 lol but then I could go to Walmart about 30 minutes and buy the entire setup already built for $2500 lol;;
lol yeah it's better to build yourself. I just dont have the money and probably wont for the majority of next year;;
Yeah mine is being built by one of the best members in rise;;
Sweet! Yeah I'm gonna have my friend who does that for a living do it lol. I will mess it up so badly if I tried;;
Me to lol by the time we get done building it and having it shipped here I will be around 2500 lol;;

<@488734758847905803>  it makes me wanna throw up. The smell and consistency is disgusting to me. I also grew up in an Irish/German household so I wasn't privy to many different choices of food lol;;
ah true;;

potatoes and meat all the way right?;;
yes?\;;
pretty much lol. very basic and bland meals;;
feelzbad;;
come over to brazil if you ever want some f lavor;;
My old neighbor is brazilian, she always cooked me stuff and it was always amazing!;;
Lol depends on what kind of sushi it is;;
ah true that;;
do you remember which state she was from by any chacne?;;
<@488734758847905803> guess who I‚Äôm getting ready to stream with;;
I don't sorry but she always made me these pastry like balls that were filled with chicken, rice and I think cheese. No clue what they were called but they are incredible;;
who <@448648678224429068> ?;;
oh theyre called Coxinhas;;
they're deep fried dough, right?;;
Yes!;;
yep;;
she's probably from Minas gerais or Bahia;;
we dont fill our coxinhas with cheese or rice usually here;;
ahh yes I just googled them, thats them! Now im hungry lol;;
YoMrBubba my clip man;;
oh thats dope <@448648678224429068> !!;;

Heck yeah;;
yeah i love those things;;
maybe it wasnt cheese or rice, its been over 7 years since I had them so Im probably remembering them wrong;;
haha;;
true true;;
Man now I really want those lol;;
theyre not that hard to make;;
they just take a while;;
Yeah I could give them a try;;
do you have any culinary talents?;;
i dont, so i always fuck the coxinhas up;;
but i am really bad at ocoking;;
lol yeah I have managed kitchens for the past 10 years, front of house manager but I've picked up alot over the years;;
ah true true;;

Is wizebot supposed to mod in twitch chat ?;;
<:PurpleMMMANGO:499310401465352197>;;
Morning all;;
Wizbot is an arsehole;;
Hey <@287320205020102667> ! I'm good how about you?;;
Thanks for asking;;
I don't know wizebot tbh;;
Im doing pretty okay just getting ready for woken;;
Work;;
<@502171199850414081> you should link your accounts in your profile so people will be able to find your twitch and twitter easier;;
Morninbrg;;
Anyone else that doesn‚Äôt have your profile linked you should link it. Be surprised people who check out your profile;;
Morning <@459504171113250837> fancy seeing you here lol;;
hey <@459504171113250837> !;;
morning <@502171199850414081>;;
yes, what <@287320205020102667> said is very helpful actually;;
Thanks <@287320205020102667> i will do it;;
How we doing;;
Guys I might need help;;
About the mod thing.;;
Mod thing?;;
Yeah I just been called a slut by someone. And wizebot didn‚Äôt ban him ? I thought it would;;
doing pretty good;;
still working;;
but im trying to get to all the messages here;;
wait;;
who called you a slut <@502171199850414081> ?;;
on your stream?;;
Yes;;
Oh;;
i use streamlabs chatbot;;
You must have it programmed. Banned words;;
^;;
;;
cajun knows better than i do;;
i am still new at all these things;;
Yes but I only use my phone app remember I am streaming from my ps4 and use twitch app in same time as I don‚Äôt have capture card;;
ah true true;;
Do you have a laptop?;;
I don‚Äôt use a capture card either. I stream straight from PS4 as well.;;
But I do have a laptop with my live stream pulled up;;
While I‚Äôm streaming;;
Ok yes I have a laptop .. not new but yes;;
So two suggestions for you. Well three;;
I would pull up live stream on laptop while streaming;;
For different reasons.;;
It doesn‚Äôt show you who hosts or raids you or who have you bitties on the phone;;
And when people use emotes or whatever it just shows the text not the actual remote;;
Emote;;
As far as that disgusting person you have two options;;
1.) you can get a mod to mod for you while your streaming. Ideally someone you trust;;
2.) enlist the help of a chat bot like nightbot or stream elements;;
I use stream elements;;
Ok apart I stopped the live and will see what I can do. As for the raid yeah in app it doesn‚Äôt show but for the host and bitties yes it tells me but I will look for laptop and add links in my profile and get the things changed;;
Thanks for the help.;;
For sure. There are tons of tutorials on YouTube as well for either if you get stuck;;
NIce <@!287320205020102667>, you just advanced to level 2!;;
thanks <@287320205020102667> !;;
I appreciate you helping the community like that;;
Of course üòÉ I was fortunate enough to get help and guidance when I started my journey so I like to return the favor;;
And god knows I need help lol between being noob, French and blonde it‚Äôs hard for me;;
true that;;
lmao;;
I know i know Mango üòî;;
<@502171199850414081> do you know how to link your profiles or would you like a walkthrough;;
On discord I mean;;
hahahahaahahah i said true that to cajun's thing;;
not to you lmao;;
I have no freaking idea <@287320205020102667> but i did open twitch on laptop !!;;
Okay are you on the app on your phone?;;
Yes;;
Okay so if you swipe right you see the list of servers your on;;
At the bottom you see your name and picture;;
There is a little gear icon;;
See it?;;
Yep;;
Click on it. Select connections. Then top right is the add option;;
Once you click add there will be a list of options you can choose to link to your profile;;
And that‚Äôs it!;;
So when someone clicks on your picture and selects to view your profile they will able to select your twitch account and go straight to your twitch page;;
I did it !!! Omg thanks a lot <@287320205020102667>;;
üòÉ;;
But make sure your not in streamer mode;;
Or it won‚Äôt work;;
oh really?;;
interesting;;

Hope your day was good <@488734758847905803>  and that really sucks for you <@502171199850414081>;;

shit's been off the hook with work though;;
Yeah work is boring for me;;
Yeah thanks <@448648678224429068> but won‚Äôt be the last time I think I muted his ass and kept going;;
Typical French .. he wanted to be an ass with someone. I don‚Äôt see why he would have been mad because I was talking English. More when he said he was American ? Bullshit ... he typed with faults so I know he was lying.;;
Don‚Äôt blame you I‚Äôm the same way if you make me mad I will not hold back;;
And I like people honest who speaks their mind at least you know where you go with them;;
boooooooooooooo;;
"tell him ""thanks for the viewer average""";;
TRUE;;
Lmao yeah !!;;
I have seen the same thing happens with all of these women that message you asking for money to come and see you all you can do then is ignore them;;
Yes don‚Äôt let them drag you down just fight back;;
Always do !!! Fighting is my life so I do it well !!;;
That‚Äôs good to hear;;
I don‚Äôt get many French or anything talking in my chat or anything I think I offend them with my titles and other language lol;;

@everyone  - i am going to drop a tip for you streamers in here, but before i want to make it clear that I dont have a problem at all if you do what i am going to describe in the following message. You can do whatever you want, i honestly dont mind. i'm j;;
;;
HOWEVER;;
If you want people to come check out your stream / channel, i suggest you dont just post the link in the self-promote bit. You might get some viewers, of course, people here are nice. but i suggest talking more  here in the groups, make friends. the people here are awesome and they will support you if you get to know them, at least a little bit.;;
;;
But like i said, if you want to continue posting your link in the self-promote and not talk in the general channel, thats 100% absolutely fine;;
i'll try to be in all streams wheneer i can;;
no  matter if you talk here or not;;
I agree;;
Good advice! I'm trying to be as active as I can here;;
Oh no! You read my weakness!!! AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!! Jking lol. But I will do my best.;;
I am one that if you talk and support I will do the same in return;;
Same for me!;;
hahah;;
i  mean;;
im n ot saying you have to talk as much as i do;;
I‚Äôm trying to keep up with you lol;;
this is my discord after all, so i will be talking more of course;;
you do a good job tbh haha;;
Lol I‚Äôm taking over this joint jk lol;;
lol trying to keep up as well but mostly I enjoy talking here;;
hahaha;;
soon you'll be a bronze mango, then grow to a platinum one day;;
I just came for the food;;
oh wait;;
haha you do a good job too <@416803598173995018>;;
hahaha;;
damn <@342732640815677453> that was good lol;;
that oh wait;;
lol;;
Hey;;
if there was food, Id talk alot more. Just sasying;;
OOF;;
<@416803598173995018>;;
haha;;
lol jk I love just being here talking. Keeps me occupied during brutally slow days at work. Plus I work in a kitchen so Im already surrounded by food!;;
Not me I would end up fat if I ate as much as I talk;;
i eat a lot, but i have the fastest metabolism in the world;;
or at leats top 3;;
I‚Äôm up there with you <@488734758847905803> my ex wife would make fun of me because I ate a bunch and would never gain the weight she always did;;
gained a solid 15 when I started this job lol;;
but luckily I can lose it quick so Im good now;;
my wife does the same hahaha;;
yeah, working in a ktichen must be hard;;
my wife is like a masterchef;;
legit;;
Nice you got it made;;
Yeah food everywhere, hard not to just grab it walking by all the time. Thats why I eat pretty healthy and go to the gym 4-5 times a week lol;;
NIce <@!416803598173995018>, you just advanced to level 7!;;

Nah you ain‚Äôt catching me;;
I'm trying to;;
lol nope not at all;;
But I'm way behind;;
Where you at <@235876529060446208>;;
Because I'm bad at discording;;
unless mango could kick you out for a few hours maybe? lol;;
Yeahhhhhhh;;
I'm 8th;;
He won‚Äôt do that I‚Äôm to cool to get kicked for no reason;;
sounds like a challenge to me lol;;
<@488734758847905803> you wouldnt kick me for no reason now would you;;
He would agree with me I‚Äôm to cool for it;;
lmao <@416803598173995018>;;
lol I know jk jk;;
i would never;;
Lol I got in trouble in Team Rise so I gotta have some where to talk;;
the only way someone could get kicked here is if they are racist, sexist, or if they offend someone really bad;;
The little (not so little) me going to bed !!! Have a good end of day @everyone !!!;;
i dont mind bantering a bit if it's  just a few jokes and stuff;;
Have a good night <@502171199850414081>;;

good night <@502171199850414081> !;;
Thanks guys üòç;;
Goodnight;;
Don‚Äôt get on to me in here but I will post what I did in there and then the messages started coming;;
;;
lol;;
did they really get mad?;;
or are you joking?;;
cause if they got mad for real at that;;
i dont even know what to say;;
Yes I started getting messages right after I posted it;;
thats not even bad though;;
No it‚Äôs not idk what the problem was;;
yeah me niether;;
I just quit talking in that discord for a little while;;
huh, thats odd;;
What‚Äôs funny is I have been in the squad I‚Äôm in a lot longer then the person messaging me and she got moved up to squad leader instead of me so I went quiet;;
That's also odd lol;;
Yeah I don‚Äôt understand the reasoning why she got it and not me but it‚Äôs whatever;;
Yeah it happens I guess. Maybe she just really dislikes the word moist lol;;
but still;;
anyway, gonna do some work.;;
will ask one more question of the day though @everyone :;;
What game have you played the most this year? And are you happy about that?;;
I ask that last bit because a friend played league of legends all year and he hates himself for that hahaha;;
Idk I‚Äôm about ready to move to a different squad I mean my squad maybe 2 people will coming into your stream and that‚Äôs it and one of the leaders won‚Äôt even come in and chat;;
I‚Äôve played fortnite the most this year and yes I‚Äôm happy about it because I am a beast at it;;
<@488734758847905803> probably R6 Siege the most so far or Destiny 2. Destiny 2 leaves me with a lot to be desired, just never felt great after playing it. Too much grinding and very little profit. R6 siege is one of the best games I've ever played though and I cant believe it took me this long to start playing it. Absolutely love it!;;
Got gold ranked last season so Im shooting higher this time around for sure;;
Nice work;;
thanks man. such a great game, wish I had more friends that played though. playing with randoms on there is rough;;
Never heard of it to be honest;;
You never played any of the rainbow six games? Do you like first person shooters at all?;;
Never have I‚Äôve been strictly fortnite cod and gta;;
ahh ok. Love me some cod too. Siege is a lot different, very methodical and strategic play style. Not usually just run and gun;;
You gotta work as a team and most people dont get that lol. Thats why playing with randoms is rough;;
See I‚Äôm a run and gun type except for fortnite;;
Yeah thats why Ill switch over to CoD alot because I like that too;;
On cod you won‚Äôt see me sit still very much unless the other team is camping every corner then I will wait on them;;
Yeah Im the same way, even playing control or domination, I still move around alot;;
I use to play domination but it requires a full team in order to do good;;
Mainly play control or TDM, control has been getting annoying with people just camping with a titan though;;
Yeah that‚Äôs all they use on core that‚Äôs why I stick with hardcore;;
<@488734758847905803> I played a lot of Titanfall 1 and 2. I felt content through 3-4 years of playing those games until i realised reality, I completely felt that I wasted my time on Titanfall and got bored of it. I sometimes come back, but I know I won't be like some other players who reached Generation 100 or more. That is comepletely too much.;;
I'll have to try hardcore soon;;
<@323288058197966849> loveeee titanfall 2;;
Hardcore is easier being one shot kills instead of unloading a full clip in someone;;
Ik <@416803598173995018> ! it is a beautful game to play;;
NIce <@!323288058197966849>, you just advanced to level 2!;;
<@323288058197966849> it really is. Shame it got released the same time as battlefield 1 and many people just didnt see it or play it;;
Yes that is true. Doggone EA and their business decisions;;
I hope everyone is having a good day today;;
My day is awesome hopes yours is the same <@357675958184181771>;;
It‚Äôs ok;;
Just at work;;
Kids are driving me nuts;;
I hear ya I just got home so it will get better for me;;
I have played Escape from Tarkov for almost exactly a year as of a couple of days ago. I love it. I think that it has the best gunplay that I have experienced in a video game. The fights can be incredible and I love what it is trying to be and what they are working towards. I am happy I have played it. HOWEVER, the development is just not as good as I would like it to be. The devs (Battlestate games) seem a little out of touch lately and are making mistakes with the content of the game, marketing, and in relationships with content creators. With this latest blunder, they have went a little too far in my opinion. (For information on that, you can see Jim sterling's video on it);;
That was really long for some reason;;
I play it as a run and gun though TALKING about R6;;
<@235876529060446208> I mean you can do that lol. Just never seems to work for me;;
That‚Äôs cause <@235876529060446208>  goes beast mode on it;;
warman goes beastmode on everything;;
even when he eats;;
Haha true;;
his parents just stare in awe and disgust at the beast they raised;;
Lmao;;
jk of course warman;;
He went quiet;;
yeah, he might be working or something;;
Yeah could be;;
Can‚Äôt wait to start my stream.;;
i cant wait to be done with this work;;
i need to do this shit quickly so i can stream tomorrow haha;;
Lol yeah I bet;;
30 minutes left for me;;
there's so fucking much;;
and i keep procrastinating;;
Gym and then stream time;;
I got an hour and half before I can stream;;
Nice. I try to do the gym before cause I will have zero motivation after;;
true that man;;
Not many responsiblities in my life luckily lol. Outside of work and the fiance, gym is it really;;
likewise;;
cleaning the house, work, streaming;;
üëÄ;;
i need to add gym back to it;;

There are exceptions. That being one of them;;
<@488734758847905803> that's awesome youre writing a novel. My fiance is a writer, respect it big time;;
I feel like Japanese is a tough language. I speak German and a good amount of spanish. Trying to learn French and Portugese (spelling?) eventually too;;
I quit the gym I can‚Äôt fit in my close because I‚Äôm getting to buff;;
Lol yeah I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs why;;

i am a translator;;
japanese isnt too hard after you learn the alphabet;;
hahaahah yeah <@448648678224429068> lol;;
<@416803598173995018> , is your wife published?;;
Lol actually I have to cut my sleeves just to wear my shirts;;
Ahh cool! <@488734758847905803> my dad was adopted and just recently found out his birth father was from Portugal so that‚Äôs why. No, she writes for a fashion magazine and has a travel blog of her own. So just small time stuff for now. She eventually wants to be published;;
ah true true;;
thats still cool too;;

2 of them are filled up;;

<@502171199850414081> , councilpersons vote for the showcase of the week;;
Oh great;;

I sensed a non-American English spelled word./;;
ü§ò;;
lol;;
lmao;;
Hiya mister SV !!;;
Hello <@502171199850414081>;;
Why do I feel like when someone say hello it‚Äôs a bit cold ?! Or it‚Äôs just me ?;;
nah, i t's not cold;;
That is exactly how i feel;;
NIce <@!342732640815677453>, you just advanced to level 1!;;
i think Hi is colder;;
really <@342732640815677453> ?;;
it's unforgivable;;
I debate over which greeting to use;;
They each have their pros and cons and it is overwhelming;;
Eh, in the discord it usually good to assume that it is not cold but in real life ya gotta be on your toes;;
hm;;
interesting;;
i know not and think not of these things;;
*in russian accent* perhaps i am robot from astrovia;;
i am being a little facetious but I do overthink these things;;
guys, if you are a sub and i didnt put you down as one, please let me know;;
For me hello is for stranger hi is for people I barely know or don‚Äôt really be close and hiya and hey for good friends or people I like;;
<@502171199850414081> That is some sound criteria for each. I will operate under these new parameters immediately.;;
It‚Äôs ok‚Äô everyone thinks different no worries;;
Nope. Different thinking people think different than me...that is  bad;;
No diversity of thought here;;
lmao;;
Aww man Im late to the party. I want a role!;;
Pick one quick <@416803598173995018> !!!;;
<@416803598173995018> you get itt then haha;;
there were 3, and only 2 got picked up;;
what do you want your role name to be?;;
Wait what are my options for roles?;;
Oh I get to pick? Wow that makes it so much harder lol;;
Don‚Äôt you wanna be a princess too <@416803598173995018> ???;;
it's basically the name of the role only;;
lol I do not <@502171199850414081>;;

howboutnow?;;
Well purplemango name has to be purple;;

No I prefer the lighter on e;;
i felt bad about being green too;;
I think this purple matches the shade of the mango though, doesnt it <@502171199850414081> ?;;
like in the logo <;;
But it match the picture;;
Yeah just saw it;;
Yes;;
And you are the boss so !!;;
NIce <@!502171199850414081>, you just advanced to level 6!;;
<@416803598173995018> , what color do you want your name to be?;;
Piiiiiiiiiiink;;
Lmao;;
lmao;;
Blue!;;
I'm so tired;;
Will you stop?? lol I am a man!;;
lol;;
Pink is lit;;
So ?! Some man like pink;;
I dont wanna hear it;;
üéÄ;;
there ya go <@416803598173995018>;;

Looks good to me;;
Fifty shades of blue;;

That was easy;;
Yeah you are right;;
But that‚Äôs how we love you;;
‚ù§;;
i love you all too;;
you guys are amazing;;
<a:mooning:482237430447996928>;;
"so, just so you guys know - the ONLY role that has any different ""perks"" is the <@&524977307493072898> one";;
which is <@300033838065778702> , <@235876529060446208> , <@450002701904773132> and <@448648678224429068>;;
yo <@197881756844556288> ! you beautiful bronze mooner;;
Starting in January, around the 15th, the council will get together once a week to decide who the showcase streamer will be that week;;
Council will be the always same persons ?!;;
"members who are more active will gain ""credit"" to be showcased. We won't necessarily get to everyone in here (since there are some people who dont stream / dont talk at all), but we will try to help";;
Just curious;;
good question <@502171199850414081> , no they won't;;
This is awesome;;
really like this idea;;
1 - people will probably not have time to do it forever;;
2 - after perhaps 6 months, i will think about changing members;;
so that everyone gets a chance to be on;;
perhaps less than 6 months depending on how many people want a chance to be on the council;;
also because I dont think I will allow council members to be featured;;
since it would kind of be biased for them to choose themselves lol;;
thanks <@416803598173995018> ! i appreciate the feedback;;
if anyone has any ideas as to how we can improve this, please tell me;;
you are free to say what you want abou tit;;
also,;;
I ask that those who arent the streamer of the week to really really help out whoever is;;
put extra effort to watch their streams and not just lurk;;
chat with them;;
if you can of course;;
this is a way for us to continue growing our networks and giving people some much deserved attention;;
Definitely agreed with that;;
I think it's good, because then when you get picked as streamer of the week, then you will get that same support back;;
My role shall be Master Chief, it is decided;;
also, I'm thinking about giving a small bit reward for the streamer of the week;;
like 100 bits;;
but thats from me;;
Very cool!;;
there ya go <@416803598173995018>;;
This community is awesome by the way, thanks for letting me be a part of it;;
it's awesome cause you guys make it awesome;;
i appreciate your presence in here dude;;
btw, streamer of the week will be Red;;
ok, so now i have some work to do, i will close discord otherwise i get distracted af;;
but will be back in a few hours;;
off to work I go;;
but that doesnt mean for you guys to not talk amongst yourselves of course;;
lol have a good day;;
Don‚Äôt work too hard !!;;
alright guys im goi9ng live;;

how messy is the house <@488734758847905803> that was a concern of yours right;;
Ah yes, there are 3 personalized roles that I gave out yesterday but they just change the color of the name essentially;;
Omg <@193534318704852993> it's so bad;;
I'd take a picture but I'm afraid someone will someday find out who my wife is to blackmail me;;
About the council:;;
Starting in January, we are going to do streamer of the week;;
And I'm asking people to be as supportive as they can to that streamer, watch them, chat with them;;

Heya <@502171199850414081> I‚Äôm doing pretty good just waking up and starting my day. How about you?;;
And then after a few months, or weeks depending on how they feel about things, I'm gonna switch council members;;
Doing good here thanks <@287320205020102667>;;

I miss french coffee lol. I havent played dying light on over a year, good game. Might have to get back on it;;
They said they were going to make a Christmas event I m so excited about it;;
Just got my first gold weapons !!!;;
is it usual single dying light or some recent multiplayer add on?;;
The old game not bad blood;;

only zombie game that i played, and i wait for 2nd;;
The following is awesome I like have my buggy to kill zombies;;
Yeah I only played the main game too. Whats the christmas event?;;
Dying Light (@DyingLightGame) Tweeted:;;
'Twas the night before Christmas. And all through Harran... https://t.co/TNmGksvExe https://twitter.com/DyingLightGame/status/1075417583212482560?s=17;;
<@502171199850414081>  well for me it was strange... at first - wow, buggy! but then.. so vast open space, for me it lost all good sensations that i had in very tight city in main game;;
all that walls and buildings;;
Very cool!;;
Yes it‚Äôs very different but story was worth it I liked it and can‚Äôt wait for the 2 !!;;
And it‚Äôs the only game I know where the dev still add new content years after the game release;;
Goodmorning;;
NIce <@!459504171113250837>, you just advanced to level 2!;;
Morning <@459504171113250837>;;
well i would say that no mans sky also adds a lot of  content, but yes, its very rare;;
morning <@459504171113250837>;;
Yeah that‚Äôs what i mean i don‚Äôt know no man sky but it‚Äôs very rare and truly appreciated;;

Morning <@459504171113250837>;;
Morning peeps!;;
<@207416847019016202> ;;
well of course, no man sky devs did it to clear their name and such, but honestly i would love to see more of it.;;
i hate how many developers close they games as soon as they decide that it failed.;;
for example - mass effect andromeda. they just stopped it;;
fuck, i just replied to myself;;
i meant <@502171199850414081>;;
<@207416847019016202> <@502171199850414081> that is good to hear from u guys!;;
<@416803598173995018> morning;;
True that <@446411352035033089>;;
Hahahaha yeah <@455797717763883009> I need me some Bois to help out lol;;
<@207416847019016202> damn man, that sucks haha. My wife is the same;;
Shit can look spotless to me, when she gets home she finds dirt;;
<@488734758847905803>  üòÇ;;
NIce <@!207416847019016202>, you just advanced to level 2!;;
I honestly suspect she keeps dirt in her pocket to tell at me lmao;;
<@207416847019016202> , have you ever checked out dead rising? Honestly liked it for a zombie game;;
Had fun at least haha;;
It's not amazing, but fun;;
Omg same <@207416847019016202>  Andromeda was such a let down;;
<@488734758847905803> is there much of a story?;;
because story is my main thing in games;;
all these cut scenes;;
In dead rising? At least in dead rising 2 there is an ok story. It's not great but it's pretty funny at times;;
Good dialogue;;
Yeah, but story is the main thing for me too;;
That's why I looooove final fantasy and persona 4;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah FF is the best;;
my favourites is FF8 and FF9;;
and 10 and 13 i think;;
10 is my all time favorite;;
in 13 i was realy felt for characters;;
13 I was enjoying the story but the gameplay turned me off too much;;
I liked 7 as well;;
I am playing 9 for the first time;;
Can you believe I hadn't played it until now?;;
and 10 was first with voice - voice is very important for me since i love story and cutscenes;;
<@488734758847905803> nope;;
ive played them all, well all main games;;
except for Lightning Retuns;;
True true;;
setting and story, and characters of 9 is awesome, play it;;
I liked 15 for the characters but the story was missing so many details;;
well i love when game has love story, thats because 8 is the best for me. and 10.;;
but 15... didnt care much about for beautiful boys;;
Hahaha;;
I liked their friendship a lot. It was cheesy but not bad cheesy;;
ive started my ffs from 7, finished it, and then started them from the 1st... 1,2,3, etc... to 13, 13-2, and then 15;;
ff15 is cool game, but story was not for me really;;
Oh cool;;
Yeah, it could have been (15 I mean);;
Have you played any of the personas?;;
Persona 4 had one of the best stories in video games imo;;
That and horizon zero Dawn;;
yeah, i started persona 1 this year on phone (i cant start from middle of series), but not finished it;;
for me its always from the first one;;
<@488734758847905803> Horizon Zero Dawn is only game ever that i platinumed;;
but i had some questions to the story, so i cant say its the best;;
Really? Like what?;;
Persona 4 is the best;;
Yoo guys just wanna say thanks for the support <3;;
How is everyone? üòÑ;;
<@488734758847905803> don't want to spoil anything to those who didn't played, but some setting decisions was weird for me - all those well preserved buildings, and rooms with tables and beds, and especially lying all around records of people voices. It broke immersion for me, because I don't find it very believable, just like in fallout, where in every broken building there are working computer;;
And overall story felt for me like at first they came up with setting - robo dinos, and then they had to come up with some explanations;;
doing good <@178951429833097216> how are you?;;
No probs <@178951429833097216> !;;
Sup <@488734758847905803>;;
Ah I see. ;;
I didn't have a prob with that <@207416847019016202> , as I felt that the places where they were seemed preserved. At least imo;;
Hey <@436313570926395407>;;
Just cleaning, you?;;
Last day of work then I‚Äôm off üôèüèº;;
Nice!! How many days off?;;
4 days, 3 days for streaming last day is Xmas eve to spend with family, then I work Xmas day;;
NIce <@!436313570926395407>, you just advanced to level 4!;;
<@488734758847905803> how many layers of dust and garbage you've already collected? ü§î;;
NIce <@!207416847019016202>, you just advanced to level 3!;;
I meant cleaned up;;
Nice man! Enjoy <@436313570926395407>   what are you going to play?;;
<@207416847019016202> - I have cleaned up a bit less than half (because of the dishes ) haha;;
The office wasn't too bad, but the living room my god;;
Well my advice - don't use dishes. Just pizza boxes;;
Lmao I do, usually;;
But even then there comes a time when you run out;;
Also, it's common to eat rice and beans here;;
Would be strange having that on a pizza box;;

Probably will actually;;
Same old <@448648678224429068>. I should be on tonight if you wanna play some CoD. Did I get your PSN? Cant remember;;
Hey everyone;;
Hi  <@357675958184181771>;;
<@207416847019016202> sup;;
Guys, I want to teach you something in Portuguese, like an idiom;;
"We say ""√© nois"", (n√≥s would be the correct spelling, but people add the I in the pronunciation as a joke)";;
"It means literally ""it's us"" or ""is us""";;
"But it figuratively means like, ""you got it, buddy"" like ""you can count on me"" ";;
Essentially it means we're friends and you did something cool or said something nice;;
You give me a ride?;;
I thank you;;
"And you say ""√© noiz""";;
Just some random culture lol;;
yeah its intresting, every language has something unusual, but you dont always  see it ifs your first language;;
That's true;;
It's easier for me to see those things in portuguese for sure;;
Since English is my mother tongue;;
Moder Russia;;
Mahder Russia*;;
"in russian for example we have idiom ""not a question"", that basically in english means ""not a problem"" or ""youre welcome""";;
like ;;
#NAME?;;
#NAME?;;
;;
but if you translate it to english literally (like i hust did), then it sounds weird;;
oh true;;
how is it in russian?;;
like the spelling;;
niet problem?;;
"what you said is how ""no problems"" exactly sounds in russian";;
but this idiom, not a question, sounds like ne vopros;;
russian has no and not, but its switched with english;;
"so ""no"" in russian is net";;
"and ""not"" in russian is ne";;
"so theres difference in ""n""";;
ah ok;;
cool!;;
i love languages;;
Obrigado <@488734758847905803>;;
also things i noticed, when english speakers say russian net, they always make it very very soft with i, like niieeet;;
and for us its just net;;
That's cool <@207416847019016202> I have noticed that too but I always thought that's how you pronounce it lol;;
üòÉ de nada <@416803598173995018>;;
ah;;
true that;;
cool;;
I know some Portuguese but not much. I have friends from Cape Verde and they speak a creole version of Portuguese so it's similar.;;
oh true. yeah it is similar indeed;;
I love the language though, so I want to learn more. Luckily I have been speaking German my whole life and a decent amount of spanish so languages tend to come easy to me. Except for the Asian ones, those are really difficult;;
oh cool;;
if youre interested in having lessons some day, i am a teacher;;
That's awesome! I will definitely let you know. Thanks!;;
no probs üòÉ;;
;;
Yo what‚Äôs up everyone?;;

<@488734758847905803> what‚Äôs up bro;;
but that happens not so much if house has.... i dont know how its in english... some trash system, when you just drop your trash in one big pipe;;

<@193534318704852993> - it's a long story, might go into it later, but i dont want to bring people down. In a nutshell, found a decent price on the switch (nothing too cheap, otherwise i would have suspected something was up), then I got scammed;;
800 BRL down the drain;;
you got a time machine by any chance? hahaha;;
Wow that‚Äôs messed up;;

I will be glad when court is over and then she has to follow by my rules <@416803598173995018>;;
lol good luck man. I guess thats one thing I dont have to worry about in life, my girl and I dont want kids;;
We are just getting started but I have custody and I have a lot of dirt to use against her that will prove she don‚Äôt need them;;
Thats good man;;
Good morning Mangos!!!!!;;
Sorry to hear man  <@488734758847905803>;;
What is BRL?;;
brazilian reals / our currency;;
First time you said 800 bucks;;
well, cause it's 800 bucks to me lol;;
Fuck;;
because even though it's worth 200 euros, within the country it's worth about 800 euros is worth in the country;;
it's a weird calculation;;
What‚Äôs up everyone;;
Gobble Gobble;;
Thank you everyone who stopped by earlier for the bitties the host the follow and lurk I really really appreciate it !!! You guys rock;;

Peaches?;;
Plums?;;
Apricots?;;
;;
Awww so cute;;
Awwww;;
hey folks üòÉ;;
almost xmas;;
did you fix your thing at the police station <@488734758847905803>;;
or did they kidnap you and sell your organs;;
sorry guys, but when exactly is xmas? ‚ò∫;;
25th?;;
Yo Jonny;;
Lol  <@207416847019016202> yeah 25th;;
I got that clarified today;;
need to remember it;;
Yeah, because the banks are working on the 24th;;
in russia no one really cares about xmas, new year (31st dec) is the main holiday, with all the presents and week of days without work after;;
also, russian christmas is 7th jan (ortodox church and such i think);;
thats why for me main thing is 9 days away, not really near;;
You still get holidays right;;
That's what matters;;
of course;;
from 1st to 9th january nobody works;;
ecxept for like store workers;;
and hospitals;;
and other important stuff;;
warehouses and such;;
I made a report <@278571432588345345> , but probably not going to add up to anything.;;
They used a cloned cpf number (social security) and made an account with that;;
So maybe I'll get the money back? But 10000 to 1 chances;;
thats sad dude;;
Yeah. ;;
But whatever;;
I believe in karma;;
Maybe this is for killing all those NPCs;;
What's up  <@455797717763883009>!;;
Watching Venom lol;;
Shit  <@488734758847905803> that sucks;;

next week will be too crazy to do it;;
Happy holidays everyone! üòÉ;;
What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs plans for today?;;
ill give atlas another try, they are continuing to constantly update servers;;
Hey hey;;
hi all;;
not that anyone should give a fuck, just wanted to clarify something i said to <@278571432588345345> on stream;;
in russia, instead of christmas, huge holiday is new year. Tree, presents, family, even our version of santa claus - its all on new year;;
yeah I was confused when you said that, I had no idea <@207416847019016202>. So santa comes in new years?;;
is it still a bearded fat man or something else?;;
yeah its bearded man, usually not fat, with long robes, and with his grand daughter <@278571432588345345>;;
hahaha;;
we got out christmas on 7th january, but its not huge, its just another holiday in new years first drunk week;;
what does the daughter do?;;
in spain we have the coming of the 3 kings on the 6th I think;;
it's like a christian thing;;
its something ike this;;
it's also bigger than santa;;
lean santa;;
and that is too old and hot for a grandaughter;;
daughter just helps him. i think shes instead of elves;;
uhmm;;
ü§î;;
so for me actual holiday in a week;;
today, tomorrow and after - usual work days;;
but after new year we got week free from work;;
<@278571432588345345>  when you say 6th january, i think you meant night from 6 to 7, so its the same here;;
we have two days off starting tomorrow üòÉ;;
I think so <@207416847019016202> , I forget the exact day;;
yeah;;
never was interesting in stalker or metro games, but watching stream is allright;;
yeah not my usual thing, but it;s cool to go outside of my comfort zone;
and metro 2033 is immersive af;;
i bet!;;
;;
Happy holidays and merry Christmas;;
Merry Christmas everyone;;
Merry merry xmas!;;
Merry Xmas to all and to all a good night;;
Happy holidays streamland;;
Installing RDR2 on my xbox now;;
just need to get gold and then can jam it up online with everyone!;;

Yes;;
Elgato hd60 <@207416847019016202>;;
nice;;
its worth ~500 bucks here;;
129.99 here;;
thats strange, usually russia prices on real things (not include games) are not lower then in rest of the world...;;
fuck;;
i misread;;
Lol;;
so its more expensive here;;
thats what would i expected;;
wev got only cheap steam games here;;
Yeah so hopefully I get it Thursday and can spice my stream up;;
<@448648678224429068>  where are you from?;;
sorry if i asked you already before;;
Central United States;;
fuck;;
why is it so much cheaper;;
Lol yeah;;
I don‚Äôt know;;
and our salaries is a joke;;
Ours is pretty good here;;
yeah;;
well, thats how it is;;
I‚Äôm getting ready to get a promotion at work so it will be ally better for me;;
thats good;;
what do you do?;;
I work at a hog farm for the biggest pork producer in the United States;;
cool;;
my  gf follows on instagram couple of american farmers;;
I‚Äôm getting ready to become the assistant manager;;
I‚Äôm a single father with custody so I lose a lot having that;;
if not a secret, how much earns someone who work at farm like this? just want to get general idea about salaries in comparison to russians...;;
I bring home $1000 every two weeks if not more;;
exactly the same as me;;
but farm workers here of course doing a lot less;;
as far as i know of course;;
i meant all kind of wokers, including managers and such;;
I will move up to $2000 bring home when I move up;;
well thats really good;;
Yes it is;;
üëÄ <@488734758847905803>;;
Lmao <@287320205020102667> those eyes;;
What ya up to buddy how are ya how was your day;;
Doing pretty good. Just checking out some stuff with my family, drove for a few hours back to my city;;
But it was cool, only bad part was that I had no internet practically for 2 days hahaha;;
Hbu?;;
Well glad you had a good day. Doing good just playing some blops;;
Best wishes for the holidays and new year everyone üòÉ;;
Wishing everybody a Merry Christmas ‚ù§Ô∏è;;
What good everyone;;
good morning everyone!;;
how are you all?;;
have been away for a few days, i know;;
the next few days might also be a bit rough tbh;;
I am going to try to stream later, but i am not sure if i'll be free to;;
Heya !! How are you doing ?! Was the trip good ?! You had a great time ??;;
hey <@502171199850414081> !!;;
yeah, it was good;;
had some really good food;;
got to spend time with my wife's family;;
how was yours?;;
It was ok you know I do everything to make everyone happy and they were so it‚Äôs nice. I had to stop the party for me and go to lay in bed as the pain was too strong for me but it doesn‚Äôt matter as I said everyone else was fine;;
im sorry to hear you felt pain, but im glad everyone else had a nice time and that youre happy about that üòÉ;;
I don‚Äôt put myself first or anything it‚Äôs not important. My illness doesn‚Äôt have to impact on others lives as it does on mine;;
So I keep all for me as pain, feelings and things like that people are not interested and I learned that and to hide everything about it;;
I dont know if I agree with that, but then again, i am not in your shoes, so i couldnt know;;
I would want to know if my wife or family were in pain;;
Because you care about the one very important to you and that‚Äôs rare believe me;;
I tell you a secret;;
I been once in hospital for an entire week a while ago and no one from my family came to visit me;;
Not even a call;;
wow...;;
that's... really not ok;;
I'm sorry to hear that;;
I know it‚Äôs not but unfortunately it made me how I m and that‚Äôs the reason I hide when it comes to my illness;;
People act like if it was contagious;;
So I put on the best smile and I m the funniest friend and girl everyone met;;
NIce <@!502171199850414081>, you just advanced to level 8!;;
welcome back <@488734758847905803>;;
did you miss us?;;
Of course he did;;
Especially me;;
üòÇ;;
I'm sorry to hear that @nylllaa (also sorry my boss called me and it seemed like I was ignoring you);;
You are a great and funny person and all of us here in the mango tree are lucky to know you and have you in our lives;;
Of course I missed you all <@207416847019016202> ! You guys are fucking awesome;;
Haha that's right <@508609867544657920>;;
I wish I could have live chatted with you all during Christmas;;
Would have been dope af;;
<@502171199850414081>;;
Morning;;
Good morning everyone;;
Morning Deadpool;;
What up <@287320205020102667> ?;;
Not much honestly just being lazy lol üòÇ;;
Hbu?;;
Omg crying from laughing right now watching my husband play on vr;;
Lol, doing some sales on the Craigslist equivalent;;
Lmao;;
Vr makes me so sick;;
It‚Äôs really wonderful to me;;
Looking everywhere;;
Lmao he is looking everywhere and just told me he was feeling sick;;
Lmao;;
Now he is stuck in game and ask for me to help lol;;
What game?;;
Oh it‚Äôs the game with the mini bots lol;;
;;
They are my ps background lol and now in game they are so cute;;
Hm. Never saw that game;;
Though I don't have vr;;
So I guess that might be why;;
<@502171199850414081> it does get u nauseous at a certain game;;
Yeah i can understand why when I see him moving his head too fast;;
Tho the real game I have is : here they lie and I think I won‚Äôt be nauseous because I will be too scared;;
Hahaha;;
Why almost all vr games are scary off;;
Good Morning;;
Morning <@323288058197966849>;;
How was Christmas?;;
My Christmas had been great and awesome! How about you?;;
<@488734758847905803>;;
Enjoy the rest of your day guys ...;;
thank you <@502171199850414081> !;;
<@323288058197966849> It was great. Got to spend some nice time with the family and chill a bit;;
Good night <@502171199850414081> !;;
sup everyone;;
Hey <@357675958184181771>;;
sup;;
Hey @everyone;;
hi <@448648678224429068>;;
how are u;;
I‚Äôm good how are you <@207416847019016202>;;
<@207416847019016202> im good, did some last shopping before new year today;;
O nice;;
<@207416847019016202> Nice;;
yeah;;
are you done with trips <@488734758847905803>  ?;;
Not yet <@207416847019016202>;;
I am going back to the internetless place on the 30th or 31st;;
And from January 8th - January 18th I'm going on a road trip with my wife and In-laws;;
Then I'll be done;;
Until May lol;;
haha;;
thats good;;
<@488734758847905803> what are going to play these days?;;
I'm going to finish God of war;;
Then I might do mutant year zero;;
On my Xbox;;
Or maybe bloodborne;;
Or yakuza;;
I dunno, it's hard to choose haha;;
I have so many games that I haven't played yet it's ridiculous;;
got mutant on my wishlist, but they dont even do discount, cheap fucks;;
NIce <@!207416847019016202>, you just advanced to level 7!;;
LMAO;;
That does suck;;
But at least it's not too expensive;;
And it's on gamepass for Xbox;;
its 17 bucks for me;;
not too cheap;;
Hm;;
The game is 17 bucks?;;
Here it's 110 hahaha;;
why 110?;;
stop talking about reals üòÄ;;
17 bucks its for poor russia;;
It'd still be 27 euros;;
yeah thats more clear;;
steam prices here lower;;
usual 2 times;;
but it can be different;;
27  euros is 30 bucks, and 30 bucks is full price on russian steam;;
Hm;;
Yeah, I might start talking in euros;;
But 110 reals in brazil.is worth like 90 euros is in europe;;
but why google says 110 reals is 25 euros? <@488734758847905803>;;
i dont understand where is the catch;;
üëÄ;;
you always talking about reals as if it costs exactly like euro <@488734758847905803>;;
Because that's the conversion rate <@207416847019016202>;;
But if you consider what the currency is worth in its own country;;
There's a calculation you do;;
So, in Brazil minimum wage is 900 reals;;
And how much is minimum wage in Europe?;;
I think in Spain it's about 1000 euros;;
If you go to McDonald's to eat something, how many euros does it cost for a burger?;;
well in russia its something about 100 bucks;;
In Brazil it's about 21 reals;;
minimal wage i meant;;
In Europe it's like 4 euros if I'm not mistaken;;
Oh damn <@207416847019016202> , that's low af;;
yeah;;
But is that a month?;;
Or a week?;;
month;;
Or every 2 weeks?;;
Oh shit;;
but thats a minimal by law;;
Ah I see;;
i dont think anyone can survive it;;
Well, here in Brazil it is too, but most people make about that;;
They'll make 1200 reals sometimes;;
Only 10% of the population makes 5k+;;
Anyway;;
If you go to a restaurant in Europe, in most places at least, you'll spend around 20 euros;;
Here in Brazil you'll spend like 80 reals AT LEAST;;
That's if you get very cheap options and no drinks;;
So, is it easier to understand now why I say that 110 reals is like 90 euros to us?;;
Out of our country, reals are worth shit;;
But in our country, it's worth a lot;;
So, what I lost last week was a month of minimum wage;;
to be honest no...;;
1 euro is 5 reals... and you saying that 20 euros meal in brasil is 80 reals... sounds about right...;;
Yeah, but our minimum wage is 900;;
And in Europe it's 1000;;
so what?;;
So for us to eat out;;
We spend 10% of our minimum wage;;
And in Europe you spend 2%;;
well if you put it that way;;
i understand, but for me its very strange way to count;;
Economics is hard indeed hahaha;;
you try to set minimal wage like this universal measure, but for me unviersal measure is dollar or euro;;
everybody understands that;;
But it's not that simple;;
and i understand that your prices is way more because its more in percent of wage, the same here in russia;;
Because a game that is 60 dollars in the US costs 250 here in Brazil. And you think, ok, the conversion rate is about right;;
However,;;
How much does it cost to live in Brazil and how much does it cost to live in the states?;;
250 is more than 25% of minimum wage here;;
60 dollars is not 25% of minimum wage;;
So, people don't usually have money to buy games here because they have bills and stuff to pay;;
And nothing is left after because they don't make enough;;
yesterday we discussed here, that same capture card costs 120 bucks in US and 500 here , and thats considering that salaries here much lower...;;
by youre measures its 5 minimal wages;;
so its like 10000 bucks?;;
Elgato hd60 costs 950 reals here;;
i totally undersand what you mean;;
It depends on how much it costs for you to live there. How much is rent? How much is food at the supermarket/restaurant?;;
How much does electricity cost ?;;
because i myself live in poor country with high prices;;
I know it's hard to understand though, it took me a while to understand all this that I'm saying;;
And maybe I'm not explaining it in the best way;;
but when you start throw around prices in reals and then in euros, honestly, i think im not the only one who very confused;;
Of course not;;
because 110 is still 20 euros, dont matter what is your wage;;
It's very confusing, no question about it;;
and dont matter what my wage;;
Ok, so then think about it like this;;
How hard is it to make 20 euros in Europe?;;
And how hard is it to make 110 reals?;;
How many hours is 20 euros worth?;;
i pay for electricity something about 25 bucks a minth;;
And how many hours is 110 reals worth?;;
If 900 = 160 hours;;
<@488734758847905803> once again, i understand your point, it all about wages, yes;;
(40 hours for 4 weeks);;
but for me it s still confusing to count like this;;
That means people make 5.625 reals an hour;;
NIce <@!488734758847905803>, you just advanced to level 14!;;
If the minimum wage in Europe is 1000 (on average);;
thats the reason why we have regional prices on steam for example;;
They make 6.25 an hour;;
How many hours does a European have to work for to pay 20 euros?;;
3 hours and a half more or less;;
How many hours does a Brazilian have to work to make 110?;;
19.5 hours;;
I UNDERSTAND )));;
Did that make it easier?;;
fuck man);;
i understood this;;
long ago;;
i live myself in country like this;;
but for me it doesnt change anything;;
Well, I was trying to help you understand it in hours;;
I thought it could help;;
i understand too well, knowing russian wages;;
but when i speak to people from other countries, i try to speak in universal currency, no matter how hard for me to earn it;;
I understand;;
And most of the time that's fine;;
But I was getting more specific;;
and for me of course its much harder to earn;;
To detail that it's not so simple as that in the long run;;
i think russia and brasil is very close in terms of wages and such;;
But like I said, I'm no expert, so I might be explaining it in a way that isn't so easy to understand;;
I agree;;
russia brasil and africa i think the only world cup hosts, who has regional ticket prices for locals;;
had;;
Yeah, and Brazil's prices were still absurd;;
It's sad really;;
It's impossible for Brazilians to visit the Amazon;;
The things to do there cost like 400 dollars each;;
US dollars;;
They don't make it cheaper for locals;;
well the same here... how the fuck american 100 bucks card costs 500 bucks here, when for many people in moscow its monthly wage;;
Yeah that's crazy;;
Cars here are insane too;;
It's a hard choice to make, living here;;
I love my family and friends;;
But I hate how hard it is to have a decent life;;
i think cheapest car here is like 8-10k bucks;;
and still everybody has them;;
Same;;
You can find a car from the 80s, all fucked up for 5k;;
But there's no point at all;;
yeah;;
in 2014 russia had financial crysis (i think it was very closely tied with all  that political shit), and dollar exchange rate doubled for us, so basically, everything import became 2 times expensive;;
at the time my salary was 2k bucks, and became 1k;;
of course, in local prices not much changed instantly, but if you want to travel for example, consider that now you have 2 times less money;;
so of course it was good for those who kept they money in euros or dollars;;
<@488734758847905803> does brazilian steam has regional prices?;;
i doubt that full price is 240 reals?;;
Yeah that really sucks;;
I don't buy much on steam since I don't have a good pc;;
But it is cheaper on PC definitely;;
yeah thats good;;
But yeah, when we want to travel it's annoying af too;;
consoles in russia has real full price, 60 bucks;;
in 2014 and after there were many many tourists, especially from asia. Imagine - for every country russia became two times cheaper;;
Yeah true indeed;;
It must have been crazy;;
sometimes it were... in 2015 i had flight from Moscow to Saint petersburg several times every monday (to make it clear, its not like one plane a day, i think there are at least several of flight a day in this direction), and each time it was huge airbus for 500-700 people, completely filled with china tourists;;
and in hotel, when i tried to get to hotel breakfast before work, there was huge line like a 100 people maybe;;
Omg;;
That's craaaaazy;;
Holy shit;;
I can't even imagine that;;
Is it better now?;;
I'd think so;;
You live in Moscow right?;;
well i wouldlt say that that was bad in some way, but i think now there is not SO much tourists;;
not counting world cup of course;;
Yeah;;
World cup times can get insane;;
I remember 2014;;
I met arjen robben at least haha;;
i thought that big moscow had already much tourists, and that we wouldnt notice world cup tourists, but it was crazy in moscow downtown;;
especially when we beat spain;;
Oh yeah that must've been so fucking crazy;;
I went to Portugal when the local team had just won the national league;;
They went crazy;;
found that photo.... its actually line to breakfast;;
I can only imagine in Moscow after beating Spain in a penalty shootout;;
Whooooa;;
all people at photo is in line;;
and there is some behind;;
Must've been good for the hotel at least lol;;
yeah and for tourism;;
Saint Petersburg is more attractive to tourists i think;;
hate that city üòÄ;;
Lol that smiley face;;
it comes like cultural capital of russia;;
Right;;
but for me its just more calmer city than moscow, and i dont like calm cities;;
Hm. I think I'm starting to prefer calm cities;;
I have lived in Sao Paulo for 16 years;;
16 years, wow;;
Yeah;;
More than half my life at this point;;
yeah thats huge;;
youre a brazilian now;;
Yeah haha;;
I do feel more Brazilian than American now for sure;;
I have for years;;
"i imagine the rest of the chat in the morning... ""what are these 200 messages about? fuck therse 3rd world countries, give me my 4 euro burger""";;
NIce <@!207416847019016202>, you just advanced to level 8!;;
LMAO ahhhahahahahaha;;
level 8, all grind, no loot boxes;;
With a large soda that I can refill regardless of the size;;
Woot woot!;;
No lootboxes here lol;;
in russia, among big fast foods, only burger king do refillable sodas;;
mcdonalds and kfc are not;;
Same here;;
we had wendys here several years ago, it was my favourite, but they all have closed;;
Wendy's just opened here;;
Sorry to hear that;;
Wendy's was one of my favorites in the states;;
Never liked McDonalds;;
well i guess they was not cool enough for russia;;
Lol;;
i love mcdonalds morning menu, but usual menu is too... i dont know, familiar, the same;;
Right;;
i never liked burger king, and they are more expensive then mc;;
so usually i choose between mc and kfc;;
Hmm;;
mc has fantastic service, and kfc service is fucked up;;
Here they are like 1 real more expensive than McDonald's;;
but chiken...;;
Chicken is life;;
Lol;;
really, i dont know about other countries, but in russia, go 10 times in mc, 10 in burger king and 10 in kfc, and you will hate 2 latter for their service;;
in different places - all the same;;
fucked up service;;
and mc is always on the same level;;
Wow that sucks;;
meaning speed too;;
Here McDonald's service is usually alright, but it's not rare for it to suck;;
seems that i had some connection trouble with discord, just get the last message...;;
I had trouble getting in it to;;
"we like to joke at work, ""if you didnt get the message, try to read it again""";;
Lol;;
Me too;;
Just got it back actually;;
whats up!? <@488734758847905803>;;
Morning @everyone !;;
How are you?;;
It's noon , working day from home, and I just got up, meaning that i have left only half of the day to work;;
Morning <@207416847019016202> doing ok here getting ready to stream !! Home is all clean and now I can relax by playing !! Hope you don‚Äôt have too much work ü§® half the day is short yeah !!;;
Morning @everyone hope you have a great day !! Keep going weekend is in the corner !!!;;
<@502171199850414081> Thank you! Yeah, theres no much to work;;
How was your stream  <@502171199850414081>?;;
NIce <@!278571432588345345>, you just advanced to level 4!;;
Good morning everyone! Hope you are all well and rested;;
Things are going to continue being sketchy regarding the stream schedule until January 2nd;;
I might try to do some mobile streaming on my trip though;;
I'll see how that works;;
wow mobile streaming;;
i saw people streaming TES Legends on mobile;;
Yeah, to show the place I'm going, it looks really beautiful in the pictures I found online;;
Hm;;
I'm actually going to <@278571432588345345> 's homeland;;
Rio grande do sul;;
good, always wanted to see picture of place where true heroes are born;;
Lmao;;
Then I should send you a pic of my mom's vagina;;
üòÄ;;
Cause that's where my brother who is much better was born lol;;
"in toxic communities there are ""your mom"" jokes, and in our - ""my mam"" jokes";;
Hahahaha;;
"Yeah, my main rule for ""making fun"" of people is to keep it light, and make it clear that you're not serious at all";;
But I do like dark humor;;
So I use it on myself and my family so I can still make dark jokes from time to time;;
Without offending anyone;;
<@488734758847905803> like dark humor too;;
dont want to offend either, but all this sad topics like anyones death or somethink like that, is often very good soil for good jokes;;
Yeah you're right haha;;
But without hearing the person's voice, sometimes it's hard to detect the sarcasm;;
<@488734758847905803> many people cant detect sarcasm even if they hearing voice;;
Here in Brazil, and I'm guessing Russia too, if you don't laugh at dark humor you get depressed;;
<@207416847019016202> I think that might just be people who don't understand dark humor. They think some things shouldn't be joked about and they don't see that the person making the joke is really just kidding;;
Heyyy;;
NIce <@!235876529060446208>, you just advanced to level 4!;;
What up <@235876529060446208> ?;;
IM TIRED BUT NO SLEEP;;
<@488734758847905803> ;;
dark humour is often offend someone, and i would say that its exactly what makes this topic interesting for jokes;;
hey <@235876529060446208>;;
That sucks warman;;
I hate insomnia;;
I worked truck tonight, mango are you free enough to chat? Like voice?;;
I like to pretend I'm offending someone with dark humor, that's me personally though;;
dont want to brag, but i never having troubles with sleep... as soon as im lying down - i will be off in less than a minute...;;
For a little bit, sure;;
Hahahaha;;
Jealous of you <@207416847019016202>;;
I'm jealous*;;
I'm usually ok to fall asleep;;
But some days it's tough;;
<@488734758847905803> well i told you early that i sleep something like from 2-3 am to 8-9 am;;
it would be much harder if id also had troubles with sleeping;;
if i cant fall asleep, i just get up and go to computer;;
lol guys;;
a pic of my mom's vagina cracked me up;;
whereabouts in rio grande are you going <@488734758847905803> ?;;
Ah true <@207416847019016202>;;
<@278571432588345345> glad to make you laugh haha;;
I'm going to the caracol falls;;
Gramado;;
Canela;;
Hmmm;;
Blumenau;;
Staying there for 10 days;;
I spent several holidays in Gramado as a kid;;
we did rafting and stuff;;
very cool place dude;;
That's awesome. We're stoked to go;;
I'll tell them you said it's cool too;;
My wife knows all about the people who participate in my streams / discord;;
that sounded like a threat <@488734758847905803>  üòÄ;;
dont do anything stupid, my wife knows everything about you;;
Lmao who said  it wasn't a threat?;;
You guys better watch out;;
Lol jk;;
Or am I?;;
we all better to be careful <@488734758847905803>;;
üò∞;;
<@278571432588345345> this emoji perfectly shows baldness;;
lol;;
blue top of the head;;
when you shaved head in winter;;
there are no bots in my twitch chat room;;
thats weird.;;
Haha;;
So what are your plans for New year's everyone?;;
<@442488674144223242> maybe you didn't open stream labs or whatever you use?;;
Ah, I also had an idea for sub-giving each month. ;;
Each month I'll ask for 3 random numbers, so the first people who say a number, those numbers will be the ones considered for the following equation:;;
Let's say 3 people say;;
5;;
12;;
7;;
Then I'll subtract, add, multiply, divide  randomly and then reach a number. Let's say I do 5+12-7, it would be 10. So the person to get a sub would be the 10th ranked discord member;;
What do you guys think?;;
It's a way to keep things interesting;;
And to avoid those who are way too far ahead to catch up from always benefitting from giveaways;;
no my bot is there. i mean all those randombots like superseahorse;;
or whatever;;
now they are coming;;
Sounds about right;;
Oh;;
Now they're coming?;;
Sounds... Nasty;;
Hahah;;
<@488734758847905803> like i said before, new year in russia is what christmas in other countries - huge holiday with trees, presents, families and such;;
so im gonna celebrate it;;
but i dont have much tradition to gather with my family on holidays, so we just will go walk across dowtown with my gf, maybe send here some pistures of new year moscow;;
Oh that's cool!;;
Yes, please do send some pictures here;;
i wanted to send one pisture of moscow downtown for several days already, but fuck, discord rotate it for some reason, and it pisses me off;;
haha i tricked discord;;
Hahahaha;;
Nice pic!;;
judging by this picture you can think that we are all living among churches here;;
Hahaha;;
Yeah;;
i would appreciate some photos of brazil too, its interesting how things are there;;
Lemme see if I have some on my phone;;
If I don't, I'll take some of the city today when I go out;;
dont want to spam, but found this photo and i think its very sunny;;
No prob about spamming a few pics haha;;
That is a beautiful pic;;
Where is that?;;
historical center of moscow, very very official center of russia (not geometrically), right on the picture is Kremlin, and behind it - Red Square;;
@everyone second camera coming soon!!;;
Welp, looks like I'm on the job hunt again mangos. The restaurant I was at called me yesterday to let me know that they are closed for the rest of the week because business is too slow;;
This sucks <@372392575547473920> I m sorry to hear that;;
It's all good <@502171199850414081> thank you for that. Luckily I've been making connections at other places around town and with my skill set it won't be long until i find a better place better suited to my skills;;
Nice <@207416847019016202>;;
Oh damn <@372392575547473920> , that sucks man;;
But chin up dude;;
Obstacles make us stronger;;
<@416803598173995018> I have a place I'm talking to this afternoon and depending on how that goes I might be trying my luck with bon appetit. I'll let you know if I do put in my resume with them;;
There you go!;;
I have a feeling you'll be on track to a better spot soon;;
Yes, keep us updated;;
Oh yeah. Luckily, I'm not usually a cocky/overconfident person but when it comes to cooking I'm damn good at it and it won't be long until I'm back at it;;
Same here when it comes to languages haha;;
Own that confidence;;
Don't apologize for it;;
Ever;;
Be like;;
Yo bitch want some beef Wellington?;;
Boom!;;
And I will keep yall updated. I'm hoping this place today pans out. I know a guy that works there that's going to put in some good words for me;;
Nice;;
I hope it works out;;
Sounds like it has everything to work out anyway;;
Yeah, there are other issues that have been slowly coming up that influenced my decision more than the store closing for the week, but that was basically the sign I was looking for;;
What up my people's;;
Yeah that is definitely a sign in my book haha;;
Hey <@508094590436507668>;;

Nm. Just woke up (late for some reason) and getting ready for the stream.;;
Nice;;
I played some vr a moment ago in live and it‚Äôs working great !!!;;
Installing the whole game to get back on live;;
Good day everyone!!!;;
Hey <@502171199850414081> and <@488734758847905803> how are you wonderful people;;
üëÄ;;

Hope you have a wonderful day;;
Same. It's 2 am time to get some sleep before I go help my roommate get a new car;;
Also i wanted to say that as nice as almost everyone is, we are in a support for support family and it would be nice when you follow someone and get the follow back, not to unfollow the person after. Not because it‚Äôs a matter of numbers of followers but it‚Äôs because support is going both ways. Thanks for understanding !!;;
Have a good night <@287320205020102667> and <@372392575547473920> sleep well Guys;;
Morning guys!;;
;;
Yes <@502171199850414081> , you're right! I hope there aren't any unfollows going around;;
Sometimes Twitch bugs out and unfollows people on your account;;
It's happened to me and I've heard others complain about it too;;
This end of the year scene is intense, I'm sorry I'm not giving all you mango seeds the support you deserve and that I want to give. Come January I promise things will be back to normal for the rest of the year;;

Poo poo pee pee penis and vagina wemon with Dick's and waek man with vaginas so fucking delecate like mummy's fine China;;
Morning  <@488734758847905803>;;
Hey <@207416847019016202> , how are ya dude?;;
I'm good, doing some grocery shopping, and then will be back to depths of subnautica;;
True that. One of the things I hate about being an adult is going to the grocery store;;
But subnautica is a decent way to bring morale back up hahah;;
And what I hate is shopping for fruits.;;
Because I hate fruits üòÇ;;
Why do you hate me? üò≠ üò≠;;
I'm just a mango boy;;
üòÇ;;
Hahaha;;
Boys is ok;;
;;
You don't like any fruits at all?;;
Nope. I eat maybe one or two fruit a year, like one apple or something;;
Also I like pineapple once a year maybe;;
Damn;;
If it's really good;;
True that;;
I have always liked eating fruit;;
Bananas, mangoes, apples, pears;;
Melons;;
Papayas;;
I can't think of a fruit that I hate actually;;
My c.f. is crazy about fruits, especially mangos;;
I meant gf;;
Oh is she? üòà;;
Hahahaha;;
Jk of course;;
<:PurpleMMMANGO:499310401465352197>;;
Haha;;
<@488734758847905803>  actually when i was small i didnt realise that i dont like fruits, just, you know, didnt get that excited when parents bought them, as i would be excited when something else, like a good meat dish or something;;
"but when i grew up and started living apart from parents, it kinda popped in my head that ""fuck, im grown up now, i dont need to eat things that i dont like""";;
like, you now, in russia in summer everyone is crazy about watermelons;;
its like a competition, who ate more of them this summer;;
true that <@207416847019016202> i know that realization for sure hahaha;;
oh damn, really?;;
and im like the only one who didnt make a bite in years;;
didnt know that;;
lmao;;
really?;;
watermelons are pretty good;;
First day back to work, morning everyone;;
but I would have thought that you at least liked oranges, <@207416847019016202>;;
well not competition, but its really main summer treat;;
hey <@508094590436507668> !;;
welcome back, hope you had a good time over the holidays;;
morning <@508094590436507668>;;
i imagined it wasnt a true competition lmao;;
<@488734758847905803>  i like hats of colors like orange, yellow or light green;;
as you can see on my avatar;;
ah i see;;
true true;;
this toxic colors;;
so you unlocked all vehicles in subnautica <@207416847019016202> ?;;
how deep have you gone;;
that's what she asked;;
haha <@488734758847905803>;;
<@278571432588345345> i think am, prawn and seamoth, and cyclops;;
i gone 900m for now, in seamoth mostly;;
now search for nickel to upgrade prawn or cyclops to go deeper;;
because i ran out of story markers;;

Will do!  Thanks <:danYes:518807035962327043>;;
no probs;;
tell us about the games you like to stream;;
I like alllll the games lol;;
lmao;;
Seriously though, I really do love just about everything.  Don't really play many MMO's or multiplayer games though;;
Mostly singleplayer games with a good story;;
same here;;
did you play horizon zero dawn?;;
Yes!;;
NIce <@!217089479863697418>, you just advanced to level 1!;;
Probably my favorite game of last year;;
Or wait...;;
2017;;
Dang... last year was 2018...;;
<@217089479863697418> very very the same here... single with a good story;;
if game is only or mainly multiplayer, i dont consider to play it;;
though i play couple of MMOs - elder scrolls and star wars;;
I enjoy a few multiplayer games, but very casually;;
horizon was 2017, but i played it this summer, so for me its 2018;;
2017 yep haha;;
HZD was, to me, the best original story in a video game;;
(the witcher doesnt count because it's based on books);;
100% agree <@488734758847905803> It really annoys me too when people say HZD had a terrible story... It was incredibly original and just absolutely blew me away;;
i dont have console and borrow it from my brother, and he was so not interested in horizon, so i had to by it myself with console prices, so ive waited for big fat discount;;
wow, i never met anyone who said that;;
otherwise they wouldnt be around anymore lmao;;
oh damn;;
yeah, ps4 prices suck balsl;;
Yeah it's nice to find others that appreciate HZD's story;;
well i said that HZD story didnt get me too much, and i still alive lol;;
for now at least;;
<@207416847019016202> , dont open the door!;;
i'm calling the hit off;;
wait!;;
i should remember that <@488734758847905803> 's wife is know all about me;;
hahaha;;
and be caitious;;
she does.;;
she knows about all the users who are active here;;
you guys are my friends now;;
you can never leave;;
shit, i think <@207416847019016202> opened the door;;
"i remembered this when you said ""you can never leave""";;
lmao holy shit that's heavy;;
damnd dude you went deep <@207416847019016202>;;
did you see any lava yet?;;
<@278571432588345345> nope, im actually looking for it now, because i read that it got kyanite;;
but i saw couple of huge underwater buildings, so cool;;
and when you encounter these things, you got some scary voices on the radio;;
oh dude yeah it's scary stuff;;
threats and such;;
scary shit roams the depths..;;
be careful out there;;
and save plenty;;
yeah i save a lot;;
but what bothers me is there is one save slot;;
for one game i mean;;
if im correct;;
i fucking histerically afraid to lose my cyclops;;
if my save will be too close to monster or something;;
yeah only one save;;
lol;;
I recommend you set up a small outpost near the entrance to that place;;
so you can go in and out and store shit there;;
also plant stuff for food and water there;;
the gel sacks can be used in the biogenerator for endless power;;
Subnautica is SOOOO good;;
duuuude;;
SO gud üòÉ;;
I want more games like it;;
me too man;;
if subnautica was multiplayer I would lose my shit;;
I would bankroll a multiplayer mod;;
There is a multiplayer mod <:danSmug:509415960956895276>;;
Called Nitrox I think;;
Not sure how well it works, but it's available to download on Nexus Mods;;
<@278571432588345345> to be honest, i use sub as my base, so all the resources are there;;
ill send you a pic, theres like 15 lockers;;
so i go to base just to recharge my power cells;;
i usually put sub somewhere on sea level, to not trigger the big monsters, and then dive deep with seamoth, gather resources and get up back;;
whatever works for you partner;;
just some suggestions;;
üòÄ;;
Morning everyone;;
morning <@287320205020102667>;;
How are ya buddy;;
hey <@287320205020102667> !;;

i was just curious;;
Whats up people? <@488734758847905803> you finish god of war?;;
NIce <@!416803598173995018>, you just advanced to level 10!;;
he did, and now he is God Of Mangoes;;
I did <@416803598173995018> , last night;;
was crazy shit;;
<@207416847019016202> , I am the Mango of War, God of Mangoes, Mango of Terror;;
Kratango;;
Morning all u firm mangos;;
what up <@459504171113250837> !!;;
how are you doing today my bro;;
got some more fortnite action going on later?;;
Doing good. Might do some realm Royale;;
Lol at firm mangos lol;;
awesome! <@488734758847905803> I loved that game, couldnt put it down;;
nice nice;;
yeah that game is fucking awesome <@416803598173995018>;;
better than rdr2;;
imo;;
<@488734758847905803> I think Red Dead is a great game but I wish I didnt pay full price for it. I got so bored with it so quickly. Wish I had waited like a year or so or until a sale. Im impatient though lol;;
So yeah I agree, God of War is definitely better;;
hm true.;;
i didnt get bored with it per se, but the story got stale around chapter 4 imo;;
then picked up again at the middle of chapter 5;;
i cant stand console prices, my brother paid for rdr2, so its wonderfull game for me, and worth its money;;
are you saying it's worth the money because your brother paid for it? haha;;
yeah <@488734758847905803>;;
tbh its really good game for me, but 0 cost makes talking about worth easier;;
Lol yeah I dunno. I just couldn‚Äôt get into it. Maybe I‚Äôll try again in a few weeks. Just still loving rainbow six siege and black ops 4 right now;;
I bought rdr2 also and haven‚Äôt played it much;;
Thanks everyone who stopped by today !! Average of 7 viewers !!! I am so happy !!  Thanks üôèüèª;;

Im in need of two mods. Must be 18+ knowledge of stream elements is a plus but not required. I will pay 10/wk. pay increases based on performance. Must be present at most streams. Stream at 8-10 CST mon-thurs. Pm me if interested. Thanks.;;
I'm going to say this you make people mods on you can trust them not pay them to do that it's not a paper round sure you need active mods right but paying people to sit in your stream is not way to do it get two of your friends in rl you trust get them to make a account follow you make them mods you have a a hole on your stream text them get them in to do the mod job or something like that;;

"Remember, streamer of the week is a sort of ""program"" that we are doing, an incentive let's call it, and it will most likely start on January 21st, so I will have less work to do and such and can be 100% supportive of that streamer.";;

hm.;;
I need to get your ps4 username still, and xbox one for that matter lol;;

<@207416847019016202> , no, not today.;;
i am playing a bit of hitman before i go back to work haha;;
but i didnt have enough free time to actually go and stream;;
New roadmap for Hitman 2 is supposed to drop on Monday.  Hopefully new info on the next elusive target!;;
@everyone I‚Äôm going to grab a bite to eat the I will be live to do the drawing so stay tuned;;
yeah i got you <@488734758847905803> ;;
streams are exhausting;;
haha they can be a little bit, yeah.;;
you need to  focus on the chat;;
then rememebr what was happenng;;
one thing i hate is when i get stuck on something stupid in a game;;
like, i cant figure out what to do;;
and people are like;;
"'it's right there""";;
That happens to me a lottttt <:danS:529135458970632192>;;
same;;
"<@488734758847905803> in half an hout after you leave my stream today, ive suddenly got like 6-7 viewers (which is big for me), and they didnt gone off, so im just  like ""fuck i cant go get coffee or eat"", and next 2 hours played without a break";;
then i had to leave, and i really felt that strength left me;;
yeah that pressure is real man;;
i remember the first time someone i didnt know came to my stream;;
talk about being nervous;;
"i was about to pick up my coffee cup that has been ready for me, and suddenly ""fuck, where are  all those people from""";;
haha;;
yeah that happens;;
but you were doing really well;;
The first person I ever had in my stream was oreocide;;
today someone i didnt know came, compliment authencity of my accent (russian game), followed me, then followed mrketcham after raid, and im like fuck, its stresfull;;
nice <@448648678224429068>;;
is he how you got into team rise and such?;;
<@488734758847905803> thanks for kind words;;
nice, thats awesome dude;;
you are authentic;;
That‚Äôs when I got invite to spoc then being in the a little while got invited to rise;;
and your english is clear;;
oh true;;
Endless backlog was the guy who got me into the team;;
raided me when i had 0 followers except my friends;;
<@488734758847905803> i listened a while my record, and noticed funny thing:;;
when i speak to chat, ive got pretty normal accent;;
but when i read dialogues, fuck, its suddenly fucking much bad;;
hm. i didnt notice that to be honest;;
well its not that much different maybe;;
and i listened to end of stream, where i was reading like more... russian style;;
hm;;
i see;;
"I dont know about other languages, but for russians main hard thing in english is sound ""th""";;
there are no such sound in russian;;
brazilians too;;
and we need to really learn how to pronounce it;;
and many just do z, or v;;
"second hard thing is ""ing"" ending in words";;
we just need to pronounce all letters;;
especially g;;
@everyone I am live;;
true that <@207416847019016202> ;;
languages are hard lol;;
let's do this!;;
drawing is going to happen now;;

"did you mean ""staying up""  <@442488674144223242> ?";;

lol yeh staying;;
the only stress is my shitty fortnite gameplay;;
haha, we just talked about stressing;;
haha youre doing all right;;
yeah we did lol;;
@everyone - https://www.twitch.tv/mrketcham <@197881756844556288> needs only ONE more follower to reach 200;;
come ooooooon;;
let's drop him that follow;;
cant help;;
i can unfollow and then follow lol;;
lmao;;
yeah follow goals are tough because of that;;
<@197881756844556288> is doing good. today when i raided, he got something like 175th follower, and now is almost 200. Good, man;;
why does the open in app button for Twitch on discord mobile not open the app anymore;;
it just takes me to the play suit;;
store;;
nice <@207416847019016202> ! that's awesome. I love the support in here ‚ù§;;

morning everyone;;
morning <@278571432588345345> <@207416847019016202>;;
hi <@300033838065778702>;;

jonny is atreaming already;;
hey hey <@207416847019016202> i am doing good. how are you doing?;;
good, good;;
watching jonny playing, and playing myself some TES Legends;;
Good morning everyone;;
Morning <@287320205020102667>;;
Hey how are ya?;;
Heya @everyone !! I hope you have a great day !!;;
morning people üòÉ;;

Heya <@502171199850414081> and <@160543395037708288>;;
and hey <@502171199850414081> and <@160543395037708288>;;
Awesome I‚Äôm doing pretty good myself üòÉ;;
About to start work;;
good morning peeps!;;
what's cracking?;;
<@278571432588345345> , how was dragon quest?;;
i got it over the holidays and i'm excited to start playing;;
what did you think?;;
very charming dude;;
it's a typical jrpg though, quite tame story and characters;;
sad trombone.;;
I did expect some lame dialogue, but was hoping for a decent story again;;
jrpg's are not doing so well storywise, at least the ones i've tried lately;;
I dunno people like the story, but usually in these jrps the story is quite family-friendly;;
like totally pg;;
hm;;
true i guess;;
i was trying to think of a jrpg that wasnt pg;;
and honestly;;
can't tthink of one lmao.;;
I guess persona 5;;
but really it is, it's just all implied sexual stuff;;
"like the maid ""service""";;
i mean, FF7 has moments where it's dark,;;
persona 4 does too - even brushes on homosexuality and promiscuity;;
hahahahahahha;;
yeah there are exceptions;;
omg thats just the most perverted shit;;
but those aren't typical jrpgs, they both have darker stuff imo;;
yeah dude the maid shit is insane;;
that's true;;
the one thing i didnt like about persona 5;;
"is the constant repetition of ""Those dirty adults think they own the world"" bla bla bla bs";;
like, diude;;
i'm a fucking adult now.;;
we're not so bad;;
also, its very hard to concentrate on story on the stream;;
you always tend to speed up things;;
and scroll some dialogues;;
true, true. i also have to learn to take it slower on streams when reading story stuff;;
Yeah it's a tough balance;;
at first i read that mango learned to take a shower at streams;;
and i thought wow;;
hahahahahahahahahahahaah;;
Have to learn to bathe on stream;;
man that would have been hilarious;;
Lol;;
maybe my subscribers will get a special stream of me showering;;
I'll show you all my tattooos;;
wink wink;;
so from now on we are not mango seeds, we are mango shower water drops;;
hahahaha;;
i will be sure to say that on my next stream;;
all that you wish, as long as you didnt call us mango sweat drops;;
i wouldnt do that. i smell horrible when i sweat;;
you guys probably smell minty fresh;;
probably is the right word;;
hahahaha;;
you streaming today <@488734758847905803> ?;;
only if i get this work done in time, but i doubt it L(;;
üò¶ *;;
tomorrow i will though;;
a little earlier than usual;;
at around 11am est;;
come here google, lets google est;;
hahahahaahah;;
oh okay, get it;;
Good afternoon üòä;;
like in 25 hours from now;;
hello <@486507510635823104>;;
good afterdark for me;;
yeah, just about that <@207416847019016202>;;
hey <@486507510635823104>;;
what up?;;
<@207416847019016202>  & <@488734758847905803>  how are you today? üòä;;
doing well, working and stuff.;;
you?;;
also doing well, playing and procrastinating;;
oh <@207416847019016202> , i have a question for ya:;;
how many lives do cats have in Russia?;;
or how many lives do people say they have in Russia?;;
In brazil it's  7, in the states it's 9;;
In China its 0;;
in russia its 9;;
lmao, they eat dogs i think <@448648678224429068>;;
ok, so cats only lose lives when they come to south america;;
typical;;
China eats cat japan eats dog lmao;;
It's certainly become a widespread belief that dog is eaten in some Asian countries, most notably China and Korea. However, it never caught on in Japan,;;
i googled it, because if i was wrong my life would have been a lie and i would want to be dead;;
lmao;;
not that i can't be wrong;;
just being wrong about this;;
Lmao;;
i would have to nuke japan again;;
jk of course;;
but not really;;
get away from my dogs;;
how was the rest of your stream last night <@448648678224429068> ?;;
;;
i mean, vietnam and korea dont really have room to breed cows and such;;
so i forgive them more easily;;
but comeon china;;
It was good I held 6 viewers until the last 30 minutes;;
wtf;;
nice dude!;;
congrats;;
Lmao;;
(the wtf was still for the china thing);;
I knew that bro;;
dont want to start holy war, but why someone cant breed some special dogs just for eating, exactly as everybody doing with cows?;;
that's what they do in those countries actually;;
yeah;;
it's a specific type of dog;;
thats what i mean;;
i mean like why do you against it;;
ah true, i gotcha;;
in 100% honesty, i joke about that;;
i dont really mind that they do that;;
It‚Äôs against my religion to kill dogs and cats;;
it's their culture;;
in India they must hate everyone because we eat their sacred animals;;
"and china like ""oooh, its all good, mango dont mind""";;
hahaahahahahahaha;;
Lol;;
CONTINUE KILLING THE PUPPIES;;
yeah;;
MANGO SAID IT'S OK;;
now they have mango to blame;;
fuck my life;;
i mean, it's not like hte chinese take your dog from your house;;
and kill it in front of you;;
it's inhumanely bred and treated in a factory somewhere just like our cows;;
no biggie to me;;
Lol;;
"for the record, i hate anything that related with like ""he had to change cities, so he put his dog or cat to sleep""";;
i fucking against that;;
yeah, me too;;
its realy not civilized;;
that doesnt happen much here in Brazil tbh;;
but when its some abstract dog...;;
well, the dog created a connection with you, and the moment it's not convenient anymore, you just kill it?;;
thats way different;;
yeah agree;;
like, you know, some vegans dont eat eggs because chickens on these factories are not being treated well;;
right;;
fuck those chickens id say;;
hahahaahahaha;;
and then would go to KFX;;
KFC;;
i mean, i feel bad for the way they are treated, but unfortunately we need protein and stuff;;
like, it's how we grew up;;
yeah, imagine world without KFC;;
i dont even want to think of a world without KFC;;
you sick monster;;
with only burger king and mcdonalds;;
but if every household in the world cut meat out of their meals one day a week, then it would already improve the situation of the world by like...;;
i dont even remember how much;;
but it was absurd;;
so every week, one day a week, my wife makes a vegetarian dish;;
for lunch / dinner;;
they are cutting down the amazon forest to give cows more room to graze and such;;
well im too short sighted to care about these global problems;;
but of course i dont eat meat like EVERY day;;
something about 29/30 in month;;
well if you count mcdonalds and sausages;;
because i dont think theeres meat;;
yeah, maybe a little bit of meat;;
NIce <@!488734758847905803>, you just advanced to level 17!;;
worm meat;;
they actually got very different meat in mcdonalds for usual menu and for breakfast menu;;
yep;;
so breakfast meat i think has some meat in it;;
usual meat is just.. i dont know... like dry plastic;;
What did I miss? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
im hungry, so you missed like 200+ messages about meat;;
yeah, thats why i dont eat at mcdonalds anymore;;
<@486507510635823104> , you missed talking about dog-eating in asia;;
and fake plastic mcdonalds meat;;
so basically all that matters in this world;;
add some gaming topics there and i'll agree with ya hahaaha;;
"ok, adding gaming toping - ""WE WANT MORE LOOT BOXES""";;
oh, no. start over lmao;;
Mmmm food üòç;;
<@488734758847905803>  we need... less loot boxes?;;
Yeah have to admit I love <@448648678224429068>  response about the cats lives tbh üòÇ;;

I was on about Japan eating cats I kinda laughed at that shit I'm sorry;;
dont be sorry, mango dont mind;;
I'm quite embarrassed now tbh üòÇüòÇ I shouldn't have said anything üòÇ;;
Don‚Äôt be embarrassed I was laughing the entire time I said it <@486507510635823104>;;
Ok thank God üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
I‚Äôm still laughing about it that‚Äôs why I went quiet;;
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
I think that‚Äôs why <@488734758847905803> hasn‚Äôt said anything lately also;;
<@486507510635823104> thanks for the following on twitter;;
i actually need to read that sometimes;;
<@207416847019016202>  it's no problem I'll follow u back on twitch too you just don't have it connected to discord üòÇ I'm going to go back through my emails cause I know you followed me the other night and thanks again for that üòÅ;;
NIce <@!486507510635823104>, you just advanced to level 2!;;
Woo level hype üòÅ;;
you didnt know what <@486507510635823104> ? - he was joking btw and so was i;;
i was making coffee;;
sorry;;
such horrible timing to go afk lma;;
lmao*;;
I‚Äôm so close to reach 200 followers on twitch but I got people that keep unfollowing and following so I‚Äôm losing track;;
Dang nabit <@488734758847905803>  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
hahahaha;;
it's like the universe conspired to make you feel uncomfortable for a few minutes lol;;
Really did üòÇüòÇ assholes üòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
Lmao;;
i try to follow on twitch all who streams in this discord, at least those who throws couple words here and there;;
not just in promote channel;;
O I will follow who ever needs it but if I keep getting emails about the same person following I‚Äôm just going to unfollow them;;
haha yeah;;
i know what you mean;;
I have 3 people that have been doing that so I unfollowed them;;
"i got this ""friend"" who keep to enable/disable his social network accounts, and keep follow/unfollow me";;
That's just stupid unfollowing and following again I don't see the point like of your going to follow someone you hit that follow button once like ü§î;;
and this shit goes on for years;;
Screw that tbh I'd get annoyed üòÇ;;
i do this only with big streamers, who is obviously dont mind if i unfollowed them;;
That‚Äôs just like subscribers they subscribe for a year then quit then come back and subscribe again I just don‚Äôt get it lol;;
hahaha <@486507510635823104> damn universe trolls;;
i dont understand unfollowing people;;
it is FREE to follow;;
like;;
just help the person out;;
wtf;;
Some people don't see it as that;;
Too many trolls like that üòÇ;;
Coffee is the best thing ever;;
Yo yo;;
hi <@522065976897044481>;;
hey <@522065976897044481> ! long time no see dude;;
how are ya?;;
<@522065976897044481>  hey hey üòÅ;;
Hey <@207416847019016202> <@486507510635823104> how are you guys;;
<@486507510635823104> i like to drink coffee, but sadly i dont get any energy from it, like others;;
I was in discord yesterday <@488734758847905803>;;
The chat stay lit it‚Äôs understandable if you miss it lol;;
<@207416847019016202> screw that;;
true, true. the days are kinda melding together with this work - but yeah sometimes i do miss a message or five;;
I gets no energy from coffee either makes me sleepy;;
coffee is just bean juice that makes me anxious and tastes good;;
damn <@522065976897044481>;;
then you need to drink chamomile tea to wake up lol;;
yeah i can get sleepy from coffee too;;
Haha maybe <@488734758847905803>;;
"i get asked a lot something like ""why would you drink coffee at night, before sleep?""";;
why wouldnt i, it just a drink for me;;
"for others its like ""if ill drink coffee in evening, i will not be able to sleep""";;
yeah there are some people who cant sleep if they drink coffee;;
even soda sometimes;;
i would say its most of the people;;
honestly though, if i drink caffeine at night for around a week in a row, then i get nightmares for some reason lol;;
It just drives me nuts getting 100 notifications about the same person following you;;
I bet it does <@448648678224429068>;;
NIce <@!522065976897044481>, you just advanced to level 3!;;
I got 3 in 4 days this week from Chitus who has followed me 50 times lol;;
maybe he enjoyng following, but dont want follow too many people;;
so he keeps unfollow and then follow again;;
I can't drink any fancy tea I just drink normal tea üòÇüòÇ;;
Sorry bit behind in the convo üòÇüòÇ;;
Well I unfollowed him so won‚Äôt happen again;;
Don‚Äôt be sorry <@486507510635823104>;;
dont be sorry, when orange and mango starts chatting, its better ignore discord for couple hours;;
to miss all this shit;;
with 1000 messages;;
Lol never know what conversations going to go on;;
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ dang;;
yeah;;
That's allot of messages and trying to keep up with convo üòÇ;;
thats reason why i dont read ACG general;;
too many messages;;
but in this discord too much messages only when im talking, so its ok;;
Just like team rise discord you can‚Äôt talk in it cause no one will answer but in here someone will always answer;;
lmao, or you can join in on the fun when we're talking too <@207416847019016202> hahaha;;
"someone meaning ""some of 2-3 people""";;
yeah, shit here gets random REAL fast;;
Yeah;;
<@448648678224429068>  - I will ALWAYS answer;;
i might be late, depending on what i'm doing at the time;;
but one thing i have always hated;;
I know you will <@488734758847905803>;;
is leaving someone hanging;;
‚ù§;;
<@448648678224429068>  I agree so much talking in team rise üòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
yeah,;;
it's a bunch of good mornings;;
"and ""now live""";;
Yeah üòÇ;;
the higher-ups talk a lot;;
Did you notice how pumped I was in my  stream last night;;
Yeah they would do though keep the chat going yeno;;
like words for sale, blackroses, etc;;
but not even arma talks so much there, and it's his fucking discord;;
Deadpool and nerdy momma too :);;
Yeah arms is quiet;;
i did <@448648678224429068> ! shit was exciting;;
Yeah actually he only puts in announcements but Arma is class tho;;
true true, <@459504171113250837> and nerdy momma do talk a lot;;
and it's not a diss on team rise;;
but it's what it became;;
If I could get people in there like that every stream my stream would be amazing;;
Oh yeah no it's not I agree completely I wouldn't diss team rise at all!;;
Same!;;
üòÇüòÇ but they do help allot! Like they really do!;;
yeah. gotta keep up that grind.;;
they do;;
They are great for support!;;
yep;;
but in discord-terms;;
But then again do is everyone üòä;;
So*;;
I mean, i am where i am on my channel because of team rise;;
Tbh same!;;
They just need to tone down the chat about random stuff and chat about streaming;;
NIce <@!486507510635823104>, you just advanced to level 3!;;
I am to;;
i mean, i have no probs personally with talking about random stuff;;
"what i dont like is that people just go in and drop ""good morning"" and then ""I am live now""";;
and expect support for that;;
i agree <@488734758847905803>;;
well those people will not be streamer of the week üòÄ;;
hahaha nope;;
People like that <@488734758847905803>  are still stuck in the follow for follow stage in their stream :/;;
But you go in ask questions and no one will answer lol;;
thats right <@486507510635823104> - and those people are more likely to give up after a while;;
yeah, true;;
i kinda gave up on the team rise general chat;;
i will sometimes chat in chucklesquad;;
but no one really answers there ither except blackroses;;
either*;;
I‚Äôve went in to ask a question no one answers so I go straight to arma in personal message;;
Excactly! Because you are not going to get the support or anyone coming by and chatting away your just going to get the odd person popping in and that's it :/ and then you'd get annoyed because your numbers aren't up there where ur want them to be and then no more streaming :/;;
yep;;
that's exactly it;;
Blackroses is awesome when it comes to support;;
yeah she is, and she's nice;;
too bad there arent more like her lol;;
Hype squad is good for their responses not going to lie if I need a hand Deadpool or tronicity with get on to me straight away and devioussoul aswell if he isn't at work :);;
Will*;;
#jealous;;
Sorry üòÇüòÇ you should've got into hype squad we are by far the best üôå;;
Our squad is quiet except for roses;;
Ain't that right <@459504171113250837>  üòÅ;;
Roses is so nice!;;
yeah she is;;
and yeah, our squad is mostly dead lol;;
<@459504171113250837> use to be in our squad til he became leader;;
yep;;
but my intention here is to do what i wanted my squad to do;;
make friends and get support;;
and give support obs;;
obviously*;;
I'm the same everywhere I go <@488734758847905803>  üòä;;
true that!;;
i can tell fo shizzles;;
I will support those who support me;;

going well, doing work and stuff;;
how about you guys?;;
I‚Äôm good watching monster university with my son;;
nice;;
i used to watch the original with my younger brother;;
he was obsessed with that shit;;
My son was obsessed with the emoji movie;;
After my stream earlier i wasn‚Äôt feeling very good so I went to bed and just woke up from nap. I know most of you guys don‚Äôt like naps lol but for my health state they are vital ... but I now am starving üôÑ;;
lol never watched that one;;
yeah, i dont like naps, but i might like them more if i were you <@502171199850414081>;;
whatcha gonna eat?;;
What we eating <@502171199850414081>;;
NIce <@!345984543246909442>, you just advanced to level 4!;;
Thinking about bolognaise pasta üçù ????;;
hmmmmmm;;
goood;;
my messaging will be a bit slower - i need to stop procrastinating and start working harder;;
but i will drop by every now and then;;
You are working too hard and too much <@488734758847905803>;;
i know üò¶;;
but soon it'll be better;;
i hope lol;;
I hope too for you !!;;
‚ù§;;
‚ù£Ô∏è go now lol and ttyl;;
What games you stream <@502171199850414081>;;
Today was the rise of the Tomb Raider but I play jus cause 3 - assassin‚Äôs creed Odyssey - Dying light - I like to play different games;;
I always wanted to play jus cause 3 i downloaded it when it was free for the ps4;;
Same here and <@197881756844556288> told me to try it and damn I m having fun playing with Rico;;
Is it online ?;;
<@488734758847905803>  I loved the part in Abe's were he says follow me and all it's so good and so funny üòÇüòÇ;;
Not the storyline for what I know at least but there is a multiplayer mode yes;;
Ima give it a try but I been grinding on madden lol;;
I Also need to check about Lara vr because the logo is appearing next to the game pic;;
The VR part of Tomb Raider was a dlc if I remember correctly.  You got to explore the croft manor in VR.  It was kinda cool, but very short.;;
Oh ok thank you <@217089479863697418> !!;;
No problem!;;
I need to play the new tomb raider. Loved the first two;;
My interest in Tomb Raider was unfortunately killed in the first two games. But I heard they turned way down in the QTE in the new one though.;;
I wasnt really bothered by it - at least not enough to kill it for me. I basically always hate QTEs with the exception of spiderman for some reason (and I would say that I was just ok with that) but it is never enough to ruin it. I know a lot of people are though. Very interesting;;
With tomb Raider it was a double sided problem.;;
"1. They had interactive ""cutscene"" sequences where the only gameplay was look at screen, determine what bottom and push it at the right time.  I am so slow and old I can't manage to do that and at the same time enjoy the cutscene. So I just feel I are sitting and waiting and not enjoying. ";;
2. They had QTE tied to the fighting system and those where more important than your own actual skill level, which totally ruined my immersion everytime.;;
;;
But that's just my opinion I know lots of people who loved it.;;
hey guys;;
true that <@87241615671832576> - i agree. you cant enjoy a cutscene 100% if there are QTE's;;
they bug me too;;
like, i'm just sitting there relaxing, i dont want to see which button i have to press to make the cutscene go forward;;
it's not like it's an impossible thing to do either;;
yeah <@486507510635823104> - follow me, and then he could fart and laugh too hahaha;;
but i have always enjoyed the tomb raider series;;
even if this last one might not be as good (Havent played it yet, but thats what i have heard);;
well i personally like QTE, but for example in detroit i mostly failed them;;
because i dont play PS4 usually;;
and not used to gamepad;;
to all these signs on buttons;;
Wassup;;
especially X button pisses me off, because xbox and ps both has it, and in different places;;
hi <@436313570926395407>;;
"so if i just started playing ps4 game, and theres QTE, and theres ""press X"", in 100% of cases i will press the wrong button";;
in start of detroit there was such tragic scene, with helicopter, and it was all dramatic, and to save everybody i needed to press X in QTE... and of course ive failed it;;
It get that one aswell <@207416847019016202>;;
true that <@207416847019016202> - but i feel that it's more forgiven on detroit because the whole game revolves around story telling,;;
and your decisions in those cutscenes change the story dramatically;;
hey <@436313570926395407> !!;;
yeah, that they do <@207416847019016202> hahaha;;
 X is square on xbox lmao;;
omg you killed everyone in the helicopter <@207416847019016202> ?;;
you sicko;;
well not killed, but i can say to you that i got several detroit fuck ups because of my QTE fails;;
and not because of decisions i made;;
I haven't played Detroit, but I actually think I will be more forgiving of QTE in that game, as it's not saying:;;
 Hi I am an action game.;;
But rather: Hi I am a narrative driven story game with QTE as my main mechanic.;;
<@87241615671832576> of course its not action game, but in action game you dont need to remember where the fucking X on gamepad;;
you just remember where to press and start playing;;
but in QTE game you play, play, and then BOOM - press X!!!;;
and im like where the fuck it is;;
lmao;;
I do get it, as I said that's one of my main hurdles. To remember and press the right button are an actual problem for me as I am to dumb and old for twitch reactions at buttons;);
exactly <@87241615671832576>;;
you got it 100% right;;
if i played ps4 more i would remember it;;
but i get it only for like console exclusives;;
I get that one aswell. My main controller are Ps4 and most games I play on my PC with a controller uses an xbox interface. Imagine the confusion and button mashing xD;;
yeah;;
lmao;;
brutal;;
i play on pc with xbox360 gamepad for many many years;;
I do feel there's a huge difference in the two topics though.;;
One driven from a game mechanic perspective and one from a purely direct input perspective and here's it the game mechanic I am angry at. ;;
QTE can be wonderful,  WHEN done right. Am most just feels like an afterthought from a group survey xD;;
I just like the Ps4 more. I have small hands, but long fingers. And the xbox just feels like a brick in my hand. But I guess I would get used to it if Iit was what I had.;;
I agree <@87241615671832576> ;;
the proposition of each game is different;;
if Detroit didnt have QTE's, there wouldnt be an opening for action at all;;
well to be honest i love when games have no action at all, just cutscenes üòÄ;;
but im okay with QTE;;
;;
nice to meet all of you!;;

Oh hell noooo;;

Resident evil 4-6 is more action-like;;

AUSIE AUSIE AUSIE;;
lmao;;
someone's excited for having some more aussie's around;;

i dont know if thats a thing;;
OI OI OI;;
only thing i know from australia is the golden gay time;;
AUSIE AUSIE AUSIE ;;
OI OI OI;;
is that a football chant?;;
thats a big thing to ausies;;
i mean us ausies love football (im not into it) and we call everyone a cunt XD;;
wtf cunt turn the cunt up ya cunt;;
Hm.;;
AYYYY CUNT YOUR THE BEST;;
thought that word was the plague for all english-speakers;;
hay cunt got a spare ciggie;;
mate you may want to quit that or you may get banned;;
only the most bogan of bogans speak like that;;
lol im just giving quotes;;
(or me when im raging on fortnite);;
yeah tru;;
ew;;
fortnight;;
XD;;
fortnite is awesome and you know it.;;
ehh im not into it;;
fortnite is an entertaining game. i just suck at shooters in general;;
now they're making me build stuff like i got coordination?;;
yeh fair enough. i cant get into games like COD;;
i downloaded it a couple weekis ago played like 4 games and uninstaled it because i kept dieing to snipers;;
the building is what sets it apart. every other shooter is the same crap;;
so you dont like it because you couldnt win straight away?;;
no;;
its just sniper users;;
its why im not that into cod;;
sniping is awesome;;
to u;;
just dont stop moving;;
im not into snipeing;;
i have 5 sniper montages on my youtube channel;;
oof;;
imma have a ree moments on mine soon from playing cod 4;;
nice, you can post those montages in <#494741950575149056> as well <@442488674144223242>;;
or at least screaming moments;;
XD;;
i'd be interested in watching;;
haha;;
i mean cod 4 is ok with friends but the grind is kinda annoying;;
what do you grind for? like rank?;;
i have no idea, havent played that game;;
i wish you can just have all wepons at the start but at least when you unlock the guns it feels like your doing something XD;;
Wassuo mango head;;
NIce <@!345984543246909442>, you just advanced to level 5!;;
oh, you have to level up to unlock weapons?;;
WASSUO;;
yo yo yo <@345984543246909442> in duh house!;;
and yea;;
thats lame.;;
remember when games had everything unlocked when you bought it?;;
yep\o;;
pepperidge farm remembers;;
"but also i dont mind it as it does give you that small feeling like ""fucking hell i unlocked a better wepon to use or someth8ing to to try out""";;
hm;;
wow <@442488674144223242> , there is like wind resistance and stuff?;;
i think they are all unlocked in the BR mode;;
you have to fix the aim?;;
no wind just bullet drop;;
that was a dope vid;;
ah true;;
which one? i put a playlist;;
ah, i clicked the first one;;
the sniper montage;;
the 40 second one that is first is actually crap;;
no 3 is my favourite;;
really?;;
lemme see;;
no 5 is quite good too;;
im nearly ready to make number 6 which has my longest snipe to date in it (288m);;
no scope;;
whoa;;
good shit dude;;
the first one was the first video i ever did any editing with so it was more mucking around. and it was before i really started to get into using the sniper;;
hm;;
i gotcha;;
yeah, i have to start uploading more stuff to my youtube channel;;
i will this year;;
its all dakotaz fault;;
i hated sniping before i watched him. i couldnt hit shit with them;;
is dakotaz a streamer as well?;;
are you done with Detroit?;;
is dakotaz a streamer? IS DAKOTAZ A STREAMER?;;
yeh, he is quite a big one;;
not ninja big but bigger than most. around 15k views at any given time;;
quite known as being one of the best snipers in fortnite;;
no still going with detroit.;;
lmao;;
probably half way through 1st playthrough i would say;;
yeah, i guess i dont follow enough fortnite streamers lmao;;
true true;;
that game is sooooo good;;
i wish i could forget the story and replay it;;
"but i dont think you could ever be ""done"" with detroit. there are so many different paths to take";;
yeah for sure;;
each little decision causes such an impact;;
let me rephrase, each little decision COULD cause such an impact;;
the last chapter i did i chose not to kill the android at the cyberlife founders place;;
next time i play through she is going to get shot;;
same as me;;
hahaahah;;
that droid gonn ged it;;
well lets be fair. at first half of the game decisions almost dont matter. but in second half its like BAM, BAM, every little move is huge;;
yeah, true true;;
i understand why they did it. its much easier;;
and it also gives the player a chance to mold to the gameplay;;
although, that first chapter as the maid android;;
there are some BIG decisions to make there;;
that dont seem big;;
maybe not in overall scheme of things early stuff doesnt matter, but eg i saved the cop that got shot in the firset chapter and he shows up at the broadcast tower to say thanks;;
NIce <@!442488674144223242>, you just advanced to level 3!;;
well as i remember those big decisions dont matter much later;;
if i didnt save him, i wouldnt have gotten that scene;;
hm... i cant remember that cop tbh;;
I know i killed my first connor;;
and i let one bad guy get away;;
i was so frustrated;;
apparently if you dont get the key from alice in the first kara chapter it can make a big difference at the end;;
yeah that too;;
im on my 4th connor üòÑ;;
my Kara ending suuuuuucked;;
like;;
the worst thing possible happened to her;;
but my Markus ending was awesome;;
game also has some funny decisions like if you save this guy here, he will save you later etc.;;
i just did the march down the main street;;
my connor has been hit by a truck, shot by hank and sacrificed himself to save hank;;
damn;;
the scene where connor chases kara is weird. on one hand you are doing everything you can to get away, then it switches and you are doing everything you can to catch her;;
In my first time Kara ending was pretty dramatic, and marcus ending heroically dramatic, and conor's ending just STIPID QTE;;
in second time marcus and kara get i think best endings, and connor get pretty heroic one;;
yeah, my connor one was pretty good excluding the fact that i did a few things wrong;;
wrong;;
but dude, my Kara one;;
fuck my life;;
have you guys watched bandersnatch?;;
i was so devastated i almost cried on my stream;;
i havent yet, is it any good?;;
yeh i liked it;;
do you know the premise;;
not at all;;
i havent and i dont whink i will, for me its like whole new genre and expirience, and im not big on something new;;
but still please dont spoil;;
just that its a black mirror thing;;
did you like the other black mirrors?;;
i do;;
with the exception of a few of the new ones;;
i watched only first episode of black mirror. It so much pissed me of that i decided not to continue;;
yeh tho the good new ones were better than the good old ones;;
oh <@207416847019016202>;;
the first episode is the WORST episode to start with;;
the first one can really put people off;;
it has NOTHING to do with the other ones;;
i promise;;
well you know, you cant wash away first impression;;
anytime i tell people to watch i tell them to skip the first one;;
haha;;
same here <@442488674144223242>;;
that first episode is bs;;
i would never skip anything tbh;;
<@207416847019016202> - start with the chrismtas special;;
each episode is a different story;;
and never will;;
the thing about black mirror is that each episode is completely stand alone, every one is different actors, diff characters different story etc;;
they are all their own little movie;;
its not a series as such;;
i understand;;
white christmas, white bear, nosedive, hang the dj, san junipero;;
they are awesome;;
it s like final fantasy - games not linked with story. but still, for me its always from 1 to last..;;
right;;
yeh im the same , i never skip;;
same;;
but that first black mirror episode is not a good way to start hahahaaha;;
but i also make sure to give things a proper go;;
not just give up on one episode;;
well i started FF with 7. But then, when i realiaed that i liked it, started from 1st one;;
i dont honestly blame people for turning away from black mirror after watching the first;;
DUDE;;
seriously go watch 15 million merrits;;
FF is so good;;
which is ep 2;;
15 million merits is a weird one, but really good;;
then you will see how black mirror is different;;
i gave Black Mirror a go. WHOLE EPISODE of a go;;
i would watch the christmas one, to clean your pallet;;
haha;;
but it's sooo different from the others;;
like, ridiculously different;;
"me and my gf was so outraged that we like ""lets swear never watch that shit again""";;
yeh, white christmas is great, but i dont think it should be the next one to watch (or the first if you skip the real first);;
<@207416847019016202> - give i t another chance;;
i promise you won't regret it;;
to be honest tho, if you forget about the actual act performed in the first one and think about the social commentary, it is actually fantastic;;
yeah for sure, i agree;;
well im not discusted by that act or something;;
so if it wasnt the act that he had to perform that put you off, i dont understand;;
im just think that its 0% realistic that politician would agree with terrorists requerements;;
really, that is your problem with the first episode?;;
it all was fucking unbelivable;;
yeah;;
"all that shit like ""man you shoyldd do it""";;
"and he is like ""ok""";;
its really stupid;;
i dont think you watched it properly then;;
im not against fucking anything or anyone you know;;
Hm....;;
he did everything he could to get out of it, but because people are so perverted public pressure got the best of him.;;
i dont have an issue with the episode itself, i just think it misrepresents what black mirror is as a whole;;
that would never occured in real life;;
in no country;;
I dunno...;;
neither would most things in most tv shows;;
the idea of black mirror, in a nutshell, is to make you question morality and ethics;;
well i agree, but some shit people do in shows you are okay with, some you dont;;
I see;;
and that the thing that make me angry;;
if you ever do give black mirror another chance, approach it in a more abstract way;;
so if tv show shows it, and it not realistic, i dont like it;;
i see;;
then i dont think you'll like black mirror afterall;;
because most of the stuff is unrealistic;;
i mean, not necessarily unrealistic;;
it is more abstract, the questions it asks are more abstract;;
"<@488734758847905803> you say so as i will habe option like ""abstract approach""";;
still, i dont mean that if film shows something unrealistic, i dont like it. With black mirror its just like chemistry, you know. right proportions of stupid characters and stupid decisions and urealism;;
i see;;
i understand;;
i disagree, but i understand;;
taste is taste;;
right?;;
well taste is the taste, right;;
but 1st episode FUCKING STUPID üòÄ;;
Sup;;
Haha;;
"you can go say of course about social message and such, but i cant get off of my head something like ""why would they decide to show it like this, it would never happened""";;
Hey <@436313570926395407>;;
I think the main thing was to show how far the public can force a public person to do something;;
so what shows do you watch then?;;
That's what I mean about abstract;;
Because it's not necessarily about the act itself,;;
i dont watch much;;
It's about the pressure put on a public person;;
if i watch something, its sircoms;;
sitcoms;;
also watched new sherlock holmes;;
and westworld;;
but aside from that - just sitcoms;;
What you don‚Äôt watch SHOWS !!!;;
Homie let me put you on to some üî•üî•üî• shows;;
that wont work i think;;
i tried to watch breaking bad;;
What type of shows you like;;
got tired of in 3rd season;;
& is west world good ??;;
only sitcoms;;
I always wanted to give that show a try;;
westworld good;;
for me;;
and i watched show before original movie;;
so i didnt know premise;;
and it was good;;
because in first 2-3 episodes you even didnt understand the premise;;
and if you watched orifinal old movie - of course you would;;
havent watched that yet;;
I watch a whole bunch of shows lol;;
same;;
"i only watch something with my gf, you know, part of ""time together""";;
but my personal time is just for games, work and some home work programming projects;;
dont like spend my personal time on watching something;;
usually just listen youtube while playing;;
<@345984543246909442> what kind of shows do you watch?;;
like, genres, or settings;;
Super heroes action thriller;;
All marvel shows DC shows lethal weapon blind spot blacklist elite ima start watching a show called diablero is on Netflix it looks insane;;
I watch a lot of shows bro lol;;
this year i watched all of the marvel last films;;
starting from hulk and 1st iron man;;
but honestly hate DCs films;;
Dc movies I don‚Äôt like but the shows is crazy good bro;;
When they do the cross over it be lit üî•;;
Wonder Woman in my opinion is the best, but other DC movies i hate;;
and marvel movies is all at minimun ok, somes are great;;
I can‚Äôt wait for avenger endgame üò©üò©üò©;;
haha;;
i didnt watch new trailer, so please dont spoil;;
Ima have a orgasm at the movies lol;;
WHAT!!!!!!;;
So this what happens;;
sorry, i dont watch trailers;;
This guy & that guy goes there;;
Hahaha;;
Then the other guy come here;;
haha;;
wait, what guy? this or that?;;
But then broooo the other guy forget about it;;
Lmao;;
& THEN !!!!!;;
Go watch the trailer my guy ü§£ü§£ü§£;;
nono;;
not for me;;
Trailers are full of spoilers nowadays;;
It's ridiculous;;
yeah;;
It's like;;
Noooo;;
Not marvel;;
*opening scene* this is what happens at the end;;
Marvel always mislead you;;
Hm;;
I member the trailer for infinity war & when I saw the movie totally different;;
Interesting;;
and i have strong definition of spoilers, for me often even short descripition is a spoiler, so i  like watch movie knowing as little as possible;;
What about music?;;
What music have you guys been listening to?;;
I've been listening to a lot of instrumental stuff;;
Like House of Waters;;
Holy shit that band is sooooo good;;
well i cant anwser that question easily, i listen a lot of different, from pop to different kind of rock;;
but usually dont listen to instrumental;;
Yeah I didn't use to either;;
I recently got into it;;
Since it helps when I am writing;;
for example, my like super top list:;;
Avril Lavigne;;
Taylor Swift;;
Panic At the Disco;;
Sum 41;;
System of a Down;;
<@488734758847905803> i agree that voice in songs can bother you when you doing something, so instrumental in background is good;;
I listen to rap hip hop reggae Latin trap;;
Like 69 anuel el Alfa Joyner lucas tyga ace hood a boogie with da hoodie;;
i dont listen much to rap, but i very liked 2 first albums of B.O.B;;
I fuck with b.o.b üî•üî•üî•;;
I like the element album;;
hm i should check out elements and the new one;;
but honestly, 3rd and 4th didnt clicked with me;;
but two first is my fucking favourite of all time;;
Very eclectic <@207416847019016202>;;
especially 2nd;;
Rap = Eminem dude haha;;
Elements is good;;
Eminem is a god üî•üî•üî•;;
google, come here again, mango uses smart word again;;
I like other rappers, but that dude is just a god;;
fuck, google translate said to me that the word eclectic translates to russian exactly like... eclectic;;
ü§£ü§£ü§£;;
so i need to find russian definition lol;;
I thought there could be something similar in Russian;;
Hahahaha it is a Latin-rooted word haha;;
Hahahahaha;;
Bro I‚Äôm latin & I never heard that word lol;;
At least my thought process was correct;;
Ecl√©tico?;;
Really?;;
i like several eminem songs, i like very much his voice, but all the times i tried listen like whole albums, i didnt much liked it;;
Really?;;
The slim shady lp is one of my favorite albums;;
Of anything;;
i googled it in russian, ok, understand;;
i also listen some russian music, mostly rappers, but its like 2 rapper bands that play with live bands and dont much appreciated in rapper comminuty;;
and also, russian rap in russia now is FUCKING BIG;;
hate it a little because dont like it, but its their taste;;
hm;;
interesting;;
i dont know any rappers from russia;;
haha of course you dont;;
though i did do a project on russian rappers during the Cup;;
nobody in russia sings in english;;
I might have the song still;;
<@488734758847905803> tell me song name if you have it;;
i'm trying to find it;;
i have the file;;
grrrr;;
im trying to upload it;;
i found it though;;
says its done;;
started to listen;;
some freestyle at start...;;
yeah, its some russian raper named Jerom, from Rostov On Don;;
didnt heard of him;;
hm;;
I understand him saying;;
kick me the ball, i need to pass, score a goal or wahtever;;
your work is tough man, listening to russian rappers;;
i was timing the subtitles;;
a translator sent me the transaltions;;
and the time codes;;
and i would edit the english and set the subtitles up;;
it was fun;;
haha;;
actually one very very popular russian rapper, Basta, is from Rostov, and there was some dispute recently, because he played live on this big beautiful stadium, but footbal club was against it because of the field;;
ah true;;
my club's stadium always has shows too üò¶;;
i was at that stadium myself, its cool;;
fucks up the grass;;
truetrue;;
brasil played against switzerland there;;
and i was there with my brother and father;;
so town was kinda brazillian;;
oh nice;;
that must have been so cool;;
tickets for the world cup games here were like... 8 thousand BRL;;
so, there was no way i could go;;
my wife, who doesnt like football, went there for a job;;
and got to see the opening game for FREE;;
haha its cool;;
i was at that game too;;
it was 350 bucks, and it was price for poor russians;;
no, i meant the opening games here in brazil, in 2014;;
fuck;;
yeah.;;
only rich brazilians went;;
one of the reasons i want to leave here;;
want to go to the amazon? it's 4 thousnad US dollars to even think about it;;
our own country's attractions is just for foreigners;;
haha;;
it's absurd;;
actually, apart from opening match, it was pretty cheap fur russians;;
50 bucks for some games;;
well its good that there was prices for russians at all;;
wow;;
that's cool;;
no, i remembered, 350 it wasnt russian price, it was 2nd grade price;;
because there was no possibility to buy cheap russian ticket on opening;;
brasil and africa did cheap local prices too as i know;;
theres 4 categories of ticket prices. 1st most expensive and 4th is relatively cheap;;
4th is only for locals;;
it was that way in africa, brasil and russia;;
but ticket sale system is crazy;;
its just lottery;;
we got tickets to 5 matches;;
whoa, did you see all of Russia's important games then?;;
no, just first;;
others - in fan zones;;
ah cool;;
that still must have been fun though;;
yeah;;
especially with spain;;
it was crazy;;
omg that game was amazing;;
fuck i just found my phone video from that last moment;;
its crazy watching it;;
there was at least several thousands people in fan zone;;
like sea of people;;
and all of them was happy at the moment;;
yeah i can imagine;;
brazil was happy too, when we played germany;;
hahahahaa;;
haha;;
What you guys are up to;;

Hahaah yeah that happens to me all the time;;
When I finish a game j never know which one to pick up;;
morning <@488734758847905803>;;

it's also fun to jump between games;;
Hey <@207416847019016202>;;
subnautica, dragon quest XI, FFXII zodiac age, battle chasers, the council;;
good choices, i would gladly watch subnautica;;
NIce <@!207416847019016202>, you just advanced to level 13!;;
all good choices indeed;;
have you ever played FFXII <@278571432588345345> ?;;
or would it be the first time you ever had contact with that story?;;
yeah really enjoyed it back in the day;;
Good morning everyone;;
morning <@287320205020102667>;;
hows your travelling today?;;
Hey thank you for coming by!;;
Appreciate that;;
yesterday i found out that <@287320205020102667> streams from his truck. thats pretty cool shit man;;
hey <@287320205020102667>!;;
<@278571432588345345> , I was so disappointed with the story though in ffxii;;
i went to it straight from FFX;;
I haven‚Äôt started yet. I just woke up. I stayed up too late and overslept lol. I have to drive about an hour away and deliver this load. After that I‚Äôm not sure where they will send me;;
Hey! <@488734758847905803>;;
<@488734758847905803> for me personally in games like FF, love story is very important. And because of that great games like 12 and 15 doenst stand high in my list;;
they lacked love story;;
true that <@287320205020102667> , i too stayed up late and am now proceeding to get rekt by this work;;
8,9,10 and 13 are top for me;;
but I will be streaming today in around an hour and a half;;
<@207416847019016202> , i dont necessarily need a love story, but i just felt the ending for some of those games were very lackluster;;
i really wanted to like 13;;
because the game is so pretty;;
but i just couldnt get into it.;;
i am in the middle of FFIX;;
to say without spoilers, i was really invested in characters drama in 13;;
i was really rooted for them and their problems;;
and love story in that game was like cherry on top;;
true, true;;
and that love story girl was really cute also;;
thats also importnant;;
lmao;;
wait, you didnt like the love story in 7 though?;;
with Tifa and Cloud?;;
‚ù§;;
tifa;;
YES!;;
Man, i need that remake in my life;;
<@488734758847905803> ;;
7th didnt have love story, Tifa was just a tease to players;;
she was cute, but there was no love story;;
so i wasnt invested much in 7th story;;
Tifa+Cloud = better than Pam and Jim;;
also, to my shame, i played with russian subs, and it was horrible, i didnt get parts of story;;
hm;;
whos Pam and Jim?;;
actually, to be 100%;;
i read that the Japanese version was never completely translated;;
because the japanese team thought the western world would never understand it;;
understand the story *;;
Pam and Jim from the show, The Office;;
dude, you gotta watch it if y ou havent;;
heard about the show, didnt watch it;;
you like hilarious comedy?;;
that show is for everyone i feel;;
well as i said, i only invest my personal time in games, and shows and movies i watch only with my gf;;
and she already watched it and didnt liked it;;
so im not sure i want spend my own time on it;;
i can play something instead;;
hm;;
she didnt like it?;;
actually, it really bugs me in life, that i dont play games as much that i would wanted (24/7), so i try to do it as much as i can;;
thats literally the first person ive heard of not liking it;;
true, i am the same;;
well tast is a taste you know;;
yep;;
im not judging;;
Karak didn't like it either;;
im just saying maybe she is a heartless killer;;
jk <@207416847019016202>;;
I've only seen the british version;;
but Karak doesnt like lots of things that others do;;
haha;;
yeah;;
omg <@278571432588345345> the US version is soooooo much better;;
SO MUCH BETTER;;
<@488734758847905803> well, but my gf introduced me to friends sitcom. at childhood i thought that it some stupid american comedy, judging by Joey's stupid face;;
but it turned out pretty great;;
i love Friends;;
that show got me through some tough times as a kid;;
when I moved to brazil and didnt know how to speak portuguese;;
i'd come home and watch that show;;
Good afternoon everyone üòä;;
hey there <@486507510635823104> !;;
what's up?;;
<@488734758847905803>  not much just still trying to wake up üòÇüòÇ you?;;
trying to get to work but im still tired from yesterday's bingeworking / procrastination;;
hey <@486507510635823104>;;
<@488734758847905803> ;;
actually, from ~1992 to 2004 brazillian soap operas was very HUGE in russia;;
i dont know if soap opera is international term though;;
the last one was Clone, and after that they stopped showing it for some reason;;
no way;;
<@207416847019016202>  did u eventually get some rest? ü§îü§î <@488734758847905803>  Definitely more prcastionation tahn anything yeah? üòÇüòÇ Just kidding üòÇ;;
hahaha I wish <@486507510635823104>;;
<@207416847019016202> - the clone was really popular here;;
<@486507510635823104> thank you for asking, i slept pretty well actually, from 7 am to 2 pm, 7 hours, its ok for me, even to much id say;;
<@488734758847905803> also Milagros vas very popular, dont know original name, and some show that was translated in russian like Just Maria;;
hm. i dont know that one haha;;
but they play THe Clone on reruns a lot;;
i really dont know why, but after clone they stopped show brazillian operas here;;
but it was really huge;;
like favourite for all housewives;;
also american show Santa Barbara was really huge in russia;;
as i know its not as popular in other countries;;
hm;;
wow;;
i would have never guessed that brazilian soap operas were popular outside brazil lma;;
lmao*;;
i will def tell my mother in law that;;
Actually when Russia open it's doors in 90s, many things became popular;;
We didn't know any foreign goods before that;;
So things like snickers, coca cola, McDonald's became a thing;;
And also foreign shows;;
And Russian copies of foreign shows;;
And foreign music;;
how old were you when that happened?;;
if you dont mind my asking of course;;
Metallic has live show in Moscow in 1992 I think, with 500k people;;
I'm from 1985;;
So it was 1st grade for me;;
ah true;;
<@488734758847905803>  I know I was messing üòä <@207416847019016202>  well I'm glad you got some rest anyways that's the main thing üòÅ;;
Good morning @everyone and Happy Monday let‚Äôs start the week off on the right foot by staying positive and focused. Have a great day and some amazing streams.;;
haha <@486507510635823104> - it's all right. it's super hard to offend me just so everybody knows. i love joking and i take jokes easily.;;
That was time when Russia got flooded with chineze NES copy, called dandy, and I got this console in 2bd grade;;
yo <@434526286115897344> !!;;
Sweet üòÅ;;
how are you bro?;;
oh, did it work well <@207416847019016202> ?;;
the console imean;;
Hi  <@434526286115897344>;;
What‚Äôs up mango. How u been;;
What‚Äôs up <@207416847019016202>;;
NIce <@!434526286115897344>, you just advanced to level 3!;;
been good, working and grinding that streamness;;
@everyone Here‚Äôs my new schedule for the moment. Trying to work out the days and times but so far this is it. Tuesday: 6:30pm - 8 pm; Thursday: 6:30pm - 8pm; Saturday: 4pm - 6pm
Is that EST?;;
<@488734758847905803> it didn't have ability to save, so it didn't have games like F2F, but it worked well. It was huge in Russia with games like Battle City;;
hmmm;;
wow, imagine playing a game without saving;;
thats impossible lol;;
Well most of that games didn't have saves;;
hm. Mario and Zelda games did, right?;;
So it was not a bug;;
Mario didn't I think;;
huh;;
So games that would have saves, was not ported on that console;;
And all others was;;
ohh;;
It was NES copy, fucking 10 years after NES came out;;
If you didn't have a memory card 9n your console in the olden days you'd need to go without a save;;
NES didn't have memory card at all, but some cartridges had;;
So us poor people who could only manage to buy the console and a game was hard locked to play without saves;;
hm;;
Oh, thats the original NES;;
Yeah;;
i was thinking of SNES;;
lmao;;
Not SNES;;
at that time Russia was not synced with other countries in terms of technologies;;
Now of course it's different;;
You can get your new iPhone the same day;;
yeah, globalization is crazy right now;;
Some things you can get even earlier because of timezones;;
ah true;;
more to the east;;
you in duh future;;
Yeah;;
ok, gotta go take a shower and get ready for my stream;;

Hello @everyone;;

How‚Äôs it going bro <@345984543246909442>;;
Is good here working type shyt;;
Wassup with you;;
Leaving work;;
Lucky you;;
Then I work again tonight;;
Oh never mind lol;;
Lol yeah not so lucky;;
Lol nope;;
Next week and week after is really going to suck;;
afternoon;;
good afternoon entreprenurs of the future !!;;
Morning mango seeds!;;
Had a toooooon of shit to do today;;
Good afternoon!!!;;
So I guess I should day good afternoon hahaha;;
What's up <@272988530278662146> ?;;
Just woke up loo;;
Getting ready for work;;
True that. ;;
I forgot what you do for work;;
I think we talked about that when we met;;
I work for Toyota;;
Ah true;;
Don't think we talked about it then. Haha sorry, my memory is absolute shit;;
Do you like your job?;;
All good;;
Yea I like it. The 2md shift I work is kinda weird in its hours but ehh;;
TRUE;;
Brazilian places usually don't have shifts;;
"It's ""stay the whole fucking day and wish you were dead*";;
Yikes you work alot of overtime;;
I do in a way, I'm a freelancer;;
But overtime here doesn't get paid for;;
You work 9 hour days;;
And if your boss needs you for another 2;;
That's your problem;;
Which is absolute bs;;
Wtf;;
wow;;
So you all do not have any overtime pay?;;
hey <@488734758847905803>;;
in russia, like i think in other countries too, overtime payment is entirely up to employer;;
<:GoldMango:499310401289191434> <:GoldMango:499310401289191434> <:GoldMango:499310401289191434> <:GoldMango:499310401289191434>;;
NIce <@!448648678224429068>, you just advanced to level 13!;;
well, russian law says that they should pay overtime, but so other countries laws;;
Hey <@207416847019016202>;;
We do, but in practice we never get paid it <@272988530278662146>;;
Yeah same here <@207416847019016202>;;
It's complete bs;;
I only get paid overtime on sundays and holidays;;
No holiday pay;;
Sad trombone;;
That's fucked up;;
It‚Äôs the dumbest thing ever;;
And instead of vacation it‚Äôs called PTO (personal time off);;
We acquire 8 hours a month for that;;
"i usually take these PTO by texting my superior something like ""i won be at work today"". and i get paid for this day.";;
dont want to brag, but work in IT can be pretty... free in matter of deciding when you work;;
I have to schedule my PTO;;
generally we have to too;;
also, when im working overtime, it probably means that i decided it for myself, to get job done, and i definitely came to work  late, so of course no overtime pay for me;;
but if its like im asked to work overtime because of something important, i usually get paid for it, mainly because it means that some client needs it asap, and client pays for it;;
the same for sudden technical support on weekends, when something breaks at client side, it usually get me over pay;;
funny thing was at world cup this summer;;
"I was like ""i have my vacation from 20 june to 5 jule, but you know, ive got tickets, so ill be absent from 14 june to 9 jule""";;
Nice;;
i want to clarify, that all this freedom is because my employer knows, thats when actually needed, ill be available 24/7, and will do everything that needs to be done;;
but if it not that important, few days of absense won hurt anyone;;
That‚Äôs how my work is if they need me they know I will be there;;
yeah;;
its like they main line in IT - work needs to be done, no matter what, no one cares how and when;;
Yeah we have our own IT department;;
At Toyota if you miss more than 2 days you are instantly fired;;
"<@272988530278662146> well for me thats why really big companies suck. they have these strict ""rules for everybody""";;
They have a very strict attendance policy lol;;
Sadly in Kentucky it's either Toyota or move out of state;;
I‚Äôm not sure they are stationed in a different town;;
and i want to say, there are many type of jobs, where discipline is very important. shops, warehouses, and many many many.;;
but IT, and office work in general, often is not one of them;;
My company is one of the biggest in United States;;
2 people just got unfollowed by me on twitch;;
what they did wrong? üòÄ;;
They keep unfollowing me then following be back so I unfollowed them;;
yeah i remember you told us about it;;
well i just recently set up my mail notifications so i hope no one will do such thing to me;;
It drives me nuts;;
How is everyone today? üòÅ;;
At work. Getting ready to start the day lol.;;
Not too bad :) gotta make that money!;;
Cant complain;;
True true;;
Doing well <@486507510635823104> hbu?;;

<@488734758847905803> I'm good just redoing my hair üòÇ I did :) I streamed fortnite for a bit today and raged üôÑ but I will be back on again with some red dead soon after I was this colour out of my hair üòÇ;;
You play on ps4 or xbox? Red dead was an amazing game;;
NIce <@!272988530278662146>, you just advanced to level 3!;;
I play on PS4 :) yeah the story line gets you in them feelers;;
<@486507510635823104> as i remember youre already in chapter 6?;;
<@207416847019016202>  I am indeed üòÅ;;
You have better memory than me I had to think there for a few mins üòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
haha;;
i just remember that you had some big story moments already;;
Yeah very sad ones too :( but I will be taking that bullgators ass tonight!;;
what game should i stream?..i am also thinking of doing a Q&A while i stream, games: uno, destiny, The Forest, Wareframe;;
what is uno? <@297612307423297536>;;
forest sounds fun;;
Nice <@486507510635823104> , are you dying it?;;
<@297612307423297536> forest looks dope af;;

<@272988530278662146>  hey don't feel bad :) you stopped in that was good enough for me and thank you I appreciate you stopping in and the bitties too :) you are working so I understand why u couldn't stay üòä but honestly thank you for stopping by earlier :);;
And that goes to everyone who stops by! I appreciate you even just coming into say hi :) cause I know you'd do be busy! Everyone has a life and a job to do! So I just wanted to say thanks anyways üòä;;
Thank you! My breaks I get are 15 minutes and my lunch I kinda talk to the wife lol. But hopefully I'll be able to check you and everyone out when I'm not at work lol;;
Morning everyone;;
How are you doing;;
Today my first day at work in 2 weeks;;
Gl  <@207416847019016202>;;
How was your stream <@217089479863697418>;;
It was really great.  So addicted to Resonance of Fate right now;;
Thanks so much for the raid too <@278571432588345345>;;
Awesome;;
Np dude;;
How are you liking Until Dawn?;;
NIce <@!217089479863697418>, you just advanced to level 3!;;
Very good so far;;
Is this your first playthrough?;;
I really liked that game;;
<@278571432588345345>  i just finished Subnautica yesterday!;;
Lets goo  <@207416847019016202>;;
What did you think overall;;
Yeah first playground for until dawn;;
Im not big on survival games overall (because im always get killed lol), so subnautica is just right survival for me - no stupid deaths or loosing all that youve build.;;
Craft progression is capturing and interesting.;;
What is my main impression, its the story.;;
On one hand, you dont have like this obvious story with quest marks and such, but on the other hand its very easy to understand what game wants from you;;
especially in the end, when you got some top schematics, and just exactly know, what you need to do and where you need to go to get ingridients <@278571432588345345>;;
so game narrates you not through map and markers, but through craft schematics;;
Yeah man it's an amazing game;;
Glad you liked it;;
we need to do adjustments to streamer of the week - all week streamer must play subnautica <@488734758847905803>;;
Lol correct;;
There will be snow dlc soon?;;
<@278571432588345345>;;
i also want to say that some end game areas are depressing;;
Still far from the dlc but they're working;;
i was not scared or anything, but fuck, after 80% game is open spaced, this caverns are tough;;
Yeah fuck that area;;
was glad when i came out;;
"and its hillarious that theres some ""short ways"" they came up with";;
to go back for quest without need to do that huge way once again;;
Yup;;
Thank god for those;;
Morning folks üêº;;

Good morning to all u firm mango ü•≠;;
im doing good <@207416847019016202> hbu?;;
hey <@459504171113250837> !!;;
what up homes?;;
<@459504171113250837> Dm;;
<@488734758847905803>  good, ive finished subnautica yesterday and now develping evil plans to make you play it;;
nice1;;
haha;;
i do want to play it;;
lemme see how much it costs;;
evil brazillian employers, who dont pay mango enough;;
tell me about it haha;;
though i am self-employed;;
so i guess i'm the evil on lol;;
well somebody pays you;;
yeah, my clients haha;;
so somebody decide how much they will pay you;;
it was 60 BRL on xbox and 107 BRL on  ps4;;
got it on xbox;;
that what im talking about, evil brazillian clients;;
60 brl isnt too bad;;
hahaha;;
"i myself usually hate concept ""game doenst explain you all, but gently pushes you towards completion""";;
"usually im like ""eplain it all to me please""";;
and show all quest markers and such;;
right;;
but with this game it was allright for me;;
even wonderful;;
yeah sometimes games do a good job of that;;
just throwing you out on your ass and not explaining anything;;
I feel like Below didnt do that wellenough and i lost interest;;
Like my very first playthrough of fallout 4, that was a sight to see;;
hahaha;;
i rage quit fallout 4;;
at that first deathclaw;;
i loved fallout 4;;
I literally unload all of my ammo on him;;
and he doesnt die;;
it was deathclaw in first town? <@488734758847905803>;;
yeah;;
why buy full price game to rage quit in first city?;;
I didnt buy it full p rice hahaha;;
i bought it on sale;;
like, i think it was 30 BRL;;
or 35;;
haha;;
and id even skipped couple days of work when it came out;;
I am not such a big fan of the fallout series, not for a specific reason, i just didnt hear about it until fallout 4t;;
none of my friends here got into it either;;
well now it confirmed that you live not under the mango tree but under the rock <:BronzeMango:499310401335590922>;;
didnt hear about fallout;;
lmao;;
I heard about fallout 4 though haha;;
but yeah, fallout new vegas and fallout 3 slipped past my radar;;
<@488734758847905803> I like it because of the stories and stuff, I like the older ones, but fallout 4 I sank a lot of hours into, just messing around with base building, watching your defenses rip enemies apart is so satisfying;;
NIce <@!498246547838992414>, you just advanced to level 1!;;
fallout 4 came out something like at 3am for me, so i had to get up and download it, and there were troubles with steam connection, as there sometimes troubles with big releases, and i started play in the morning instead of work;;
true.;;
I love games with good stories;;
nice haha;;
<@207416847019016202> Fallout before work, story of my life;;
haha yeah;;
i played fallout 2 before school when it came out;;
I sacrificed my English studying, just to play Fallout;;
fuck english yeah;;
lmao;;
Anyone know the site you need to use for charity;;
what do we need it for;;
sey dads wai i hef greet gremmre;;
hey <@436313570926395407> , not off the top of my head, no.;;
i think <@502171199850414081> was using it last month;;
lmao <@498246547838992414>;;
I couldn't be bothered with simple subjects such as English, here It's not a main subject, so it's easier than in native English speaking countries;;
of course;;
i was good at english in school, but in reality, school or university level of english is nothing and cant help you understand something you need to read or especially listen;;
I dropped English, Dutch and Geography to build a bad house in Fallout 4;;
actually what really got hyped me in fallout 4, its what most of the people hate - its voiceovered dialogues and cutscenes;;
lmao;;
Yeah I dig it too, some sarcastic lines made me giggle;;
i hate when main characters words are not voiced, and when i cant see his face in cutscenes;;
and it f4 it was perfect - all dialogues shows you your character speaking;;
many people hate it because it takes from them ability to roleplay;;
but i want to see what character developers came up with, and not imagine it myself;;
depending on the game i like a mix;;
like with the witcher 3;;
detroit become human;;
stuff like that;;
Well I love choices, but it's not that role play that I meant;;
I meant more imaginative roleplay;;
i see;;
i understand;;
yeah, i  like voiceacting over silence as well;;
except in Zeld;;
a;;
I loved doing the voices in skyrim myself when I was home alone, to not look like I was losing my sanity;;
Good morning mangos;;

Whassup <@356903756333318144>;;
Welcome <@356903756333318144>;;
What's on your schedules today?;;
playing something, listening to something;;
what game you plan to stream <@488734758847905803> ?;;
Hey all, sorry I havent been active the last few days. We had someone quit at work so for the time being, I am picking up the slack. Yay! lol I have been swamped and exhausted at the end of the day. Gonna try and stream tonight;;
Hitman i think <@207416847019016202> . do you have any suggestions?;;
damn <@416803598173995018> that sucks;;
what do you do again?;;
But yeah, it's ok to take some time off from streaming if youre nto feeling it;;
personally i would like witcher 3 <@488734758847905803> ;;
or you finished it?;;
I havent. I still have some dlc to do;;
I could get into some witcher 3;;
personally i couldnt care less about hitman, but its my problem;;
haha;;
<@488734758847905803> lol yep it does. Boss is being cheap and seeing how I can go without hiring someone to help out. Needless to say, I'm miserable now. Just trying to stay positive but I am basically doing two full time jobs in an 8 hour period so Im just really tired;;
are you at least getting paid extra <@416803598173995018> ?;;
Yeah they gave me a good raise when he quit 5.2% increase so I think they used that to butter me up for the more work lol;;
hm;;
yeah but that is not good;;
Nope not at all, I told my boss I wont do this forever so hes aware. If it doesnt get better in 2 weeks or so, I will probably look for another job honestly;;
<@416803598173995018> are you in some kind of cleaning business or i confused you with someone else?;;
Nope not me, I work in food service/hospitality;;
damn <@416803598173995018> - yeah, find a place that values you;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah it might come to that. I have a new boss and I just dont think he understands how the place operates yet. Oh well, wait and see I suppose;;
TRUE;;
sorry, maybe im too dumb, but what is  food service/hospitality? <@416803598173995018>;;
like food delivery or something?;;
probably hotel stuff <@207416847019016202>;;
or a hostel of some sort;;
thats my guess at least;;
that was my first guess;;
but then for some reason i discarded it;;
i see haha;;
"<@207416847019016202> I work for a company called ""Fooda"" we run and operate cafeteria style dining halls in office buildings";;
get it, so you like managing different food places;;

Good morning guys!;;
I'm waking up super early today to get ready for tomorrow: gonna leave super early for a road trip to the South of Brazil;;
early morning <@488734758847905803>;;
Long trip?;;
Hey <@207416847019016202> !;;
Yeah, 8 hours total. I'll be driving 6 and my father in law for 2;;
so you wont be streaming couple of weeks as i remember?;;
Then on Saturday we drive for another 5;;
I won't stream games, I'm going to try to stream from my phone to show people where I am and stuff;;
The views, etc;;
It'll be a just chatting category stream;;
thats right, i remeber now;;
I just don't know if it'll work too well, I don't know how good the cell phone reception will be in the mountains and stuff;;
Hopefully it'll work, I think it'll be awesome;;
well send us some pic from your trip;;
That I will definitely do;;
The mountains in Brazil.. sounds awesome;;
Sadly I'm away from the applachation mountains I'm used to. My state is weird half has mountains the other is flat ><;;
yeah, mountains definitely sounds awesome;;
oh damn <@272988530278662146> , how long did you live near the mountains?;;
https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjvgfHv6-LfAhWEh5AKHSykARIQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gramadocanela.com.br%2Fparque-do-caracol%2F&psig=AOvVaw3tASeSvqBBCHU4MFc-o9Hq&ust=1547196931171762;;
Pretty much most of my life. But I moved for work. I have pics from my childhood home. Do I post those in pics and memes.;;
Or is it ok if I post one on general;;
Figure I'd ask;;
you can post something like that in  general, sure;;
pics and memes is more  for when it's about a topic that youre not talking about now or something;;
since it is relevant to our present topic, general is fine;;
that  link i sent  is one of the places i'm going to;;
;;
The first pic is one side of the holler I grew up on. The 2nd pic is from a hill from where I grew up;;
dude thats beautiful;;
Sadly my hometown was a coal town. When coal was no longer needed it's kinda dieing. I'm sad cause the memories I have there is childhood innocence but its home;;
yeah, i know what you mean about that for sure;;
it can be sad, but it happens. what's important are the  memories;;
because the world will constantly change and evolve around us;;
i went to my hometown a few years ago;;
and just seeing the new stores, remodeled buildings, etc was enough to make me feel like it was too different;;
Yea. Sadly the one thing that stands is Walmart;;
It will never die lol;;
lmao yeah will it ever?;;
The world will be at the brink and it will end with Walmart vs Disney;;
hahahaha;;
omg i'll write a short story abotu that;;
I'll read it lol;;
good morning/afternoon/evening everyone!;;
afternoon <@300033838065778702>;;

Good all around;;
hope everyone's having a good day;;
NIce <@!300033838065778702>, you just advanced to level 3!;;
I am so far, <@300033838065778702> , just freaking tired haha;;

i am good <@488734758847905803> probably just a bit sleepy. stayed up watching netflix and i am not paying the price lol.;;
lmao;;
what were you watching? anything good at least?;;
i watched The Good Place. lol;;
<@442488674144223242> , i'm just gonna copy paste that into <#494741950575149056>;;
oh how are you liking it <@300033838065778702> ?;;
I watched an ep or two but didnt get into it;;
sorry, i thought i was in that channel;;
<@300033838065778702> the good place is freaking gold;;
<@488734758847905803>  watch at least the end of the first season. the twist is brilliant and then it gets better;;
<@442488674144223242> totally agree. i don't really binge watch series but it made me laugh. especially the 'monk' lol;;
im not normally a ted danson fan, but i think he is the key to the whole series;;
<@488734758847905803> i love it. i just wish its longer than 20 mins per episode. and now, the pure agony of waiting for the new episodes to come out;;
oh yes. Ted Danson too.;;
speaking of new episodes, i need to watch Vikings today;;
nice;;
i will check it out;;
"if you guys like slower ""dramas"" and such";;
i'd recommend twin peaks;;
oh, and also handmaid's tale;;
shit's fire yo;;
Good morning everyone;;
yoyo;;
How are ya <@278571432588345345>;;
NIce <@!287320205020102667>, you just advanced to level 8!;;
stressed out man xD;;
but I'm well overall;;
how goes for you;;
Morning  <@287320205020102667>;;
Yeah I hear ya man. Sometimes life bro. I try not to stress too much tho. Doesn‚Äôt help any situation.;;
Hey how are ya? <@207416847019016202>;;
I'm good. Internet went down in office, so I kinda think to go home;;
yeah I try too man, but I'm heading a really big database migration and there's a lot of pressure;;
even though there's many people working on it it's my responsibility ultimately that it's done well and in time;;
so gonna be 2 looong months;;
Sounds fun  <@278571432588345345>;;
How big and which database it is?;;
I work in at a big financial software company called Factset and I'm team lead for one of their products. It's a database with hundreads of tables, each with millions or billions of rows;;
Well I meant size in gb (if not a secret), and by which I meant what database, like Oracle, ms, etc..;;
ohh it's about 2 tb as far as I remember;;
That's big all right;;
yeah it's a ton of data;;
and we're migrating all of the database and APIs to a AWS Aurora PostgreSQL database;;
more than 400 end points basically;;
a massive shabang;;
At my former work axapta database was something about 18 tbs.... but usually I work with Oracle databases with 200-300 gb;;
One very huge Russian post server once did migration from Oracle to postgres;;
That's crazy jonny;;
Crazy jonny;;
Anybody getting resident evil 2 today?;;

*oof*;;
sure am <@502171199850414081>;;
How are you doing today <@502171199850414081> still feeling pain?;;
how was work today <@502171199850414081> ?;;
<@498246547838992414> yes but you know it‚Äôs daily for me ... my illness doesn‚Äôt leave me alone...but with the work it‚Äôs hard to handle it;;
<@488734758847905803> it was intense... it‚Äôs hard;;
<@502171199850414081> ah god, I hope it ends some time for you;;
damn...;;
<@498246547838992414> you are nice thanks but unfortunately it‚Äôs incurable;;
I will be strong as always but it won‚Äôt be easy;;
<@502171199850414081> Damn, well I hope you can bite through it, I'm sure you can, just don't force yourself;;
Thanks for the nice words;;
I have a Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, I know it's probably not as bad as you have, but I know the feeling of pain, a thing that always helped me through it was taking it easy and doing things I love, but I don't know what your illness is  (and won't ask), just find the little things to enjoy to take your mind off it, I hope it helps, It really sucks to have an incurable illness, that makes you suffer this bad.;;
Good job <@!498246547838992414>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
<@159985870458322944> Waaaaaw;;
that was bad timing from mee6 damn;;
My god, yes;;
i'm sorry to hear that <@498246547838992414> , i am happy to see that you found ways to mitigate the pain;;
and to push through;;
The pain isn't constant, It's just a side effect of having an unsatiable tiredness;;
But, my body feels tired, but my mind doesn't, is the annoying part;;
hm. have you tried reading?;;
it's what i do whenever i feel that my mind is wide awake but my body is dying;;
read something so boring;;
and try to understand it;;
your brain consumes 40% of your energy on a daily basis;;
your eyes i think consume 15-20%;;
I can find enjoyment out of literally anything, I have found out about myself over the years;;
My eyes are horrible, when I look at a tv without my glasses, I curl up into a ball of tears and die;;
haha;;
same;;
"my ""degrees"" for my glasses are -6.00 in each lens";;
Oof, mine aren't that strong, I only need them to see far, and protect my eyes a bit;;
Even just in the winter I wear sunglasses;;
nice new bot message for dongle up <@488734758847905803>;;

To be honest, I've heard very strong opinion about how game failed it's final episode;;
But I'll give it a try;;
damn that must suck;;

sad;;
Well that can be subjective;;
I hate Life is Strange for that;;

Wassup chat;;
Morning everyone!;;
It's friday!;;
Yoo boys I just had an awkward/funny moment.  So I‚Äôve been watching the Netflix traveler series these last days. So, between 2 episodes tonight, I wanted to take a smoke break and noticed I was out of cigarettes. Went to the nearest gas station to get a pack. Getting back to my car there was that weird junky girl asking me if I could drop her off on my way back. I didn‚Äôt feel like letting her in my car, I just didn‚Äôt feel like dealing with her. So I said that I was going the opposite way and couldn‚Äôt pick her up. Then she asked, are you a traveler? I was like what? Why? No what do you mean? She said, well you‚Äôre acting like you know what‚Äôs next. I shook my head and went in my car. She shouted, ‚Äúthere is a problem!‚Äù I was like what the fuck????;;
üòÖ;;
What the fuck..;;
That is a very appropriate response;;
I just got back home and this shit was so weird üòÇ . I don't even want to watch the next episode lol;;
Man are you just a little curious?;;
Good job <@!272988530278662146>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
Lol might wanna lock your door though bro just in case;;
hahahahah üòÇ üòÇ;;
Happy bigger dongle by the way;;
Thank you lol;;
This has to be on my top 10 weirdest freakiest life moments;;
If there was 9 other moments.. that.. I got nothing. I'm kinda shook;;
lmao <@272988530278662146>;;
<@272988530278662146> The list isn't done yet haha. I guess this started the list lol. God damn what a bizarre moment;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
lol <@348165887347523594> that's a bad trip;;
Very bad <@278571432588345345> . I can't even finish my series;;
dude it just makes all the better!;;
its REAL;;
lmao;;
He may see his destiny you never know;;
hahaha;;
hope it was better than the game lol;;
üòÇ;;
i didnt get it, is this story somehow connected to show? <@348165887347523594>;;
like, she asked if you are traveller;;
and traveller is the show;;
<@207416847019016202> The show is about travelers coming from the future;;
Netflix show. I was hooked, very good show;;
oh i get, you know whats next;;
Yeah lol;;
well she probably says it to everybody;;
Yeah I bet, just the coincidence;;
She's a junky...It's just the context;;
there is a problem - does this phrase has any connection with show?;;
Yeah, It's all about big problems coming in the future, a little bit like the 12 monkeys;;
The context was so funny though, watching this series, and this junky tells me all these crazy things üòÇ;;
maybe shes a traveller?;;
hahaha;;
It shook my dongle;;
it would be weird if she asked you about your purple dongle;;
Man, I would've thrown my computer and all electronics out the window;;
Including my dongle;;
Morning dongle mangos;;
I'm on the road already;;
Morning dude! <@488734758847905803>;;
Hey <@207416847019016202> !;;
I posted the pic in the wrong place haha;;
wonderful photo that you just deleted;;
Hahaha;;
Looks like someone is going to have a good tine!;;
I was supposed to start driving, but my father in law wanted to take a nap after a few hours;;
someone who dont drive;;
I'll ask my wife to take pictures while I drive;;
Have a wonderful trip  <@488734758847905803>;;
Oh I'm gonna drive alright haha;;
Thanks <@348165887347523594> !;;
I'll be as active as I can here and in streams;;
Bro your travelling. Have fun we will be here when the signal is strong!;;
so <@488734758847905803> yesterday on interview you mentioned something that happened in Brasil last month, and some mugs. What's that about? what happened? and overall, how is criminality in brasil?;;
we have many brazilian football players in russia, and most of them tell stories about how criminal is bad there;;
Morning good folks üêº;;
What Remains of Edith Finch is free on Epic Games Store from Jan 10 -24;;
Morning good panda;;
Well maybe I should get it, free is free;;
Yeah, I wanted to purchase it. But now it's free;;
What've you been playing Orange?;;
I started and beated subnautuca recently  <@455797717763883009>;;
And yesterday I started The Concil;;
Oh Council. How's it?;;
Beginning of the game is very promising with all that story and mechanics;;
sweet. Will pick it up on sale maybe;;
have a lot of backlog anyways. And I havent played anything since christmas;;
I bought it on sale too;;
It's too expensive for me;;
Yeah, I wanna get Vampyr too;;
The council is 20 bucks for me without discount;;
Considering that Russian steam full price is 30, it's almost fullprice;;
"How mango would say, ""it's technically 20 bucks, but for me it's 40""";;
haha true;;
I just found the PS4 version for 16‚Ç¨ on Amazon;;
That's very good;;
Good job <@!207416847019016202>, your dongle just grew to 15!;;
LOL;;
I think I got it for 10, but not sure;;
Your dongle grew to 15;;
xD;;
I just know that I would considered it a good price, but don't remember;;
Oh wow 10 is good;;
I'm sure that I didn't bought it for 20;;
Too much;;
ah, maybe i'll get it for 16 and sell it at GameStop after is finish it;;
<@207416847019016202> , I got mugged twice last month;;
They took 1600 bucks total;;
It hasn't happened to me in over 9 years, but it's not too good. Sao Paulo has a lot of poverty and I don't know anyone who lives there who hasn't been mugged;;
you told us about some scheme with switch;;
is it related?;;
well thats definitely very very sucks;;
we dont have such things here these days;;
"well of course we have robberies, but its pretty rare and not systematic, and heres not any certain rules like ""if you will go at that place at night, you will definitely get robbed or killed""";;
Yeah, part of it was that scheme. ;;
Also, there are many places here where you'll die if you go;;
Or get robbed;;
so all that talks are not lie then <@488734758847905803>;;
i meant all that stories from players and such;;
cause there a lot fake shit that are told about russia in the world;;
"like ""when you will arrive in russia, angry russia fans will beat you""";;
Good morning mangos;;
moorning <@287320205020102667>;;

Waking up. Kinda cold. And hungry lol but Otherwise good and you?;;
im good, almost finished my work day;;

where are you heading next time?;;
I‚Äôm in west Ohio. Heading to east Ohio then I‚Äôm not sure;;
does it take very long to make one delivery?;;
in russia we have routes that takes 3-4 days;;
so it's like truck simulator?;;
haha;;
american truck simulator its when <@287320205020102667> streams at day;;

Minus 10 and feeling good <@455797717763883009>;;
That's photoshopped;;
minus 10, i'd have a facemask on;;
Yeah +6 in january for me is Photoshop too;;
üòÑ;;
Good morning and happy Friday everyone!!!;;
<@479126963852935168> morning;;
Friday is happy indeed, since work day is over for me;;
I'd be wearing a coffin at -10;;
You are so spoiled guys;;
I lived in all kinds if minus regions, and -10 is fucking nothing;;
What would I hate is living in hot region where 35+ in summer;;
I'd always take -30 with inland climate instead of -10 humid climate.  All in celcius;;
I agree;;
I lived in sea city, where -30 is like -50 in other cities;;
Gelato is the only thing I like on minus;;
Give me 25-30¬∞ C anyday;;
I'd say it like this. I prefer +25 over -25, +30 over -30, but anything more than 35, fuck, let it better be minus than plus;;
When it's getting colder and colder, you just put on more warmer clothes;;
And when it's got hotter, you are already naked and it doesn't help;;
Hey everyone üòÅüòÅ;;
Good job <@!486507510635823104>, your dongle just grew to 5!;;
Hey  <@486507510635823104>;;

<@488734758847905803> -10? Not really, if you wearing appropriate clothes;;
Lmao <@455797717763883009> about the photoshop.joke lol;;
Nah, -10 isn't so bad if there's no wind;;
;;
It all kinda looks the same haha;;
LOL;;
Blue sky, same everywhere;;
Hahaha;;
And some pine trees;;
<@488734758847905803> Moscow doesn't often has wind so it's ok;;
Ah, yeah that makes it easier;;
If you ever go to Montreal;;
You'll see how hard it is to deal with the wind there;;
Stings like hell;;
I know;;
I lived in winded city;;
Minus 30 there is hell;;
Damn;;
Soon I'll be driving again;;
And I lived in -50, and still winded -30 is worse;;
Whoa;;
-50?!;;
Yakutsk;;
-50 is when they close schools;;
And there's minus from September to May;;
But pretty hot in summer;;
You get used to it;;
It's all about clothes;;
And climate;;
And wind;;
Well I was born there so I didn't get used to it, I just was ok there;;
<@207416847019016202>  & <@488734758847905803>  how you doing? üòÅ;;

btw all buildings has max 5-6 stories;;
"because of soil, that, i think, kinda ""always frozen"", you cant build tall buildings";;
well on picture there are some tall buildings, but thats a maximum;;
by the way its also city with white nights in june;;
Do you know what the first coldest city is?;;
Oh true I didn't know that;;
I want to see those white nights;;
<@488734758847905803> open link, its like in first few sentences;;
first also russian city;;
actually i lived thet until 10 years old and also didnt know about white nights. apparently me and my brother were always gone to sleep before 10 pm;;
i happened to know about that city has white nights only at 26, when i went there for work;;
Oh that's interesting haha;;
Is your brother older?;;
;;
It's like a European city in Brazil;;
Your trip going well so far <@488734758847905803>?;;
Yeah it is <@272988530278662146>;;
Thanks for asking. It's hot as hell but it's been interesting sightseeing around the town for a bit;;
Tomorrow we're off to a town called gramado. Lots of Germans and Dutch people;;
Enjoy  <@488734758847905803>;;
;;
That's how 6¬∞ looks like;;
take pics of Gramado dude! Loved that place as a kid;;
also that beard is gonna absorb you like a symbiote;;
<@455797717763883009> nice pic dude! Is that Milan?;;
<@278571432588345345> - I will take plenty and post them here;;
Hahaha I actually trimmed it a few days ago;;
The wind made my face look crooked though lmao;;
<@488734758847905803> no, my brother two years yonger;;
i just had a fantastic nap from 10 pm to midnight;;
Yeah  <@488734758847905803>;;
i was afraid that i will be awake only in morning, so tired i was, but here i am;;
<@488734758847905803> your beard looked photoshoped;;
If you reverse the picture, it actually looks like the tip of a dongle <@488734758847905803>;;
A big black dongle;;
Now I just went too damn far üòÇ üòÇ;;
it looks like a dongle for me without reversing;;
üòÇ;;
Ah I see <@207416847019016202> - so he couldn't have noticed it;;
<@207416847019016202> does that mean my beard looks good?;;
LMAO <@348165887347523594> hahahahaha;;
Hahaha damn, I got dongle face;;
<@488734758847905803> i actually meant that it looks like from right side its way bigger;;
so i meant like some lazy ass photoshoping;;
Ah yeah;;
That was the wind haha;;
haha;;
whats the weather there now <@488734758847905803> ?;;
like +30?;;
32;;
Though it just rained a little;;
So it's a little better;;
Maybe 29 right now;;
haha;;
But until 45 minutes ago it was 32;;
do you have air conditioner in your house?;;
Same temperature here, I try not to use the A.C on day time so the power bill don't give me a heart stroke every two months. But like everything we get use to it. Sometimes it's just unbearable though;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
good thing that i dont have AC and dont need to worry about electrical bill üòÄ;;
<@207416847019016202> Yeah! In that sense you're lucky. But don't you have to use heat?;;
you mean to make room warmer?;;
Yeah;;
I know in France, we didn't need air conditioning but we did need the heater for a large chunk of the year;;
i dont know how it is in other countries, but in russia we have central heating (dont know right term in english). each room provided with buikt-in radiator, filled with water. and when winter comes, they turn heating on;;
Hooo nice, maybe it's a remnant from the u.r.s.s?;;
This is pretty good;;
well its definitely get installed in new buildings too;;
yeah sure;;
some new pipes also has ability to turn it off;;
mine hasnt, but its allright;;
and we pay like very little for it;;
for electricity we pay much more;;
But the idea of having central heating is particular and pretty ingenious. I've heard about engineers theorizing on using datacenters enormous amount of heat to be redistributed.;;
i dont even know how much for the heating, because its fixed little price, that usually paid by landlord;;
<@207416847019016202> Very cool;;
it really strange idea for me that not all countries has it;;
also many people here has AC, but its not pre built-in, its just by your own wish;;
I think that it may have something with history. Even though Russia has changed the idea of redistributing goods was strong at a certain point in time, and there is no point in changing good ideas;;
<@207416847019016202> Yep, I guess that's because it's mostly cold right;;
of course;;
but many other countries has at least -10 at winter;;
does anyone helpes themselves with AC in those countries?;;
I'm not sure I understand the question;;
im talking about that apparently not all countries has central heating systems;;
but still those countries has cold winters;;
at least 0 or -10;;
how they warming up? by having AC in each appartment?;;
In france, It depends, most buildings have some kind of central heating system. But not houses or you know, smaller buildings. As for AC, it's just rare to see. Maybe South, but still, very rare. Where I live, it's hot and it's getting more and more common to see houses with A.C.  But not as much as when I lived in Florida, there every single house, building whatever you call it has AC;;
well, single houses in russia of course has their own systems, especially old houses with stoves for heating;;
sure;;
but big cities has mainly big buildings;;
with at least 60 appartments;;
and private sector is mainly big reach houses or somthing like that;;
old private sector is slowly getting destroyed;;
by old private sector i mean something like this (not counting big yellow house, its pretty new);;
<@207416847019016202> I see, it's different in France, not all buildings have central heating, it's just not the same, lot of people have to use their own, but I do think that new buildings are being build with it;;
its pretty on this picture, its definitely some kind of village near city. but when its inside of big city, its just takes place;;
Yeah I got you;;
this is typical and very popular russian type of building. not all of them so ugly, but my point that most of living houses is like that, with many appartments and of course with central heating, and central gas often;;
As we speak I'm reading a French article on how impressing the Russia's central heating is and how efficient;;
haha;;
"as a russian citizen i never thought that so basic and primitive soviet ""technology"" is something good üòÄ";;
So I'm gonna impress you. Listen to this;;
In France the average price for heating per month is 135 euros, when in Russia is just 7 euros;;
The gap is huge;;
haha seems about right, but im even not sure that its so big as 7 euros;;
And it is indeed a Soviet thing;;
maybe;;
<@207416847019016202> lol;;
well you know, we actually have pretty small salaries and pretty big prices on many other things;;
<@207416847019016202> Maybe less who knows the article I'm reading is from 2016 database;;
so it kind of evens out and not good for us;;
<@207416847019016202> I see;;
Yeah, I got you;;
Still very impressive haha;;
cheap steam games is only russia's cheap thing i think;;
Yeah?;;
well when you compare russian prices, and russian salaries with other countries, its not good comparison for us;;
Yeah maybe haha...I get it;;
for example. callison recently boight capture card in US  for 125 bucks;;
i looked up... this card costs 500 bucks here;;
Damn;;
and 500 bucks its what average moscow citizen is fucking making;;
I see, that is very low income;;
i cant afford it, but its still huge money for me;;
and some guy in US (no offense) whos apparently making much more, paying just 100 for it;;
i meant i CAN afford it;;
Prices are much higher in France than the U.S too, but not that high, and the lowest legal income for 35 hours of work per week is 1250 euros per month;;
<@207416847019016202> yeah I got that;;
But in the other side, LIfe in France is expensive , especially where I live, overseas in Martinique, it's crazy expensive.;;
we have minimum wage (defined by law) around 120-150 bucks, but in reality most of population makes at least 300-400< at least in moscow;;
many makes 500-1000, but its closer to office work;;
I see,;;
To give you an example, here, the lowest rent you can get from a decent apartment(1 room, 1 bathroom, 1 kitchen and small living room) is 500 euros per month;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 5!;;
well i pay 500 bucks, so rent here is expensive too;;
I pay my 5Mb/s adsl+phone provider 70 euros per month;;
<@207416847019016202> Really? how can you afford living then?;;
its not the LOWEST, you can find for 350-400, but its usually too ugly;;
<@207416847019016202> It''s still way too expensive;;
How does this work then?;;
<@348165887347523594> i dont know answer to this question üòÄ ;;
some has their own appartments (that they got from parents and such);;
some working their ass off, and there are husband and wife working together, making each 500-1000;;
well i want to clarify that this is moscow prices;;
lol;;
other cities has much cheapest rent, and much lower salaries too;;
I'm baffled;;
<@207416847019016202> ok ok;;
also i want to say, that russia dont have this rent way of life;;
of course we have rent;;
but its not like everyone renting;;
everyone tries to buy their own;;
ususally with mortgage;;
Yeah well same here, is more expensive in main cities. Like living in Paris is just ridiculously high, I can't even dream of it;;
<@207416847019016202> Looks like France doesn't like house owner ship, the government is pushing and pushing for rents. Well in my view at least because it's extremely hard to afford a house, really really hard, I mean way hard lol;;
I'm fortunate though, I'm mainly talking about the average citizen;;
Hello <@348165887347523594>;;
Hello @everyone;;
How much are cars in Russia, here it's off the scales, I bought my Hyundai Tucson for 31 000 euros, which is way more expensive than the us.;;
<@348165887347523594>  also, russia actually is VERY centralised country. everything happes in Moscow and St Petersburg. For example, if you live in Vladivostok (its where i lived, other part of the world, 7000 km from moscow, near japan), and want to get yourself credit or debit card, you have to wait 2 weeks while they priduce it in moscow and send it too local bank;;
hi <@448648678224429068>;;
]<@448648678224429068> Hello;;
How‚Äôs it going;;
<@207416847019016202> It takes the same amount of time to get a credit card here too;;
<@448648678224429068> Pretty good, how about you <@448648678224429068>;;
I‚Äôm doing good just working that grind on my stream;;
<@448648678224429068> haha which game?;;
<@207416847019016202> - I don't have an air conditioner;;
<@348165887347523594> cheapest russian shit car a costs something about 6000+, and cheapest euro cars, like kias and such, is something about 6000-10000;;
Bo4;;
What's up <@448648678224429068> ?;;
<@448648678224429068> Good, I don't own it yet, I plan on though;;
Not much how you doing <@488734758847905803>;;
<@348165887347523594> i mainly meant not amount of time, but thing that its like every city is dependant on moscow in some way;;
so its actually its huge difference, to live in moscow or st petersburg, or some other city in russia <@348165887347523594>;;
It‚Äôs fun bro <@348165887347523594>;;
<@207416847019016202> I got you, like you can't get shit done without passing through Moscow administration system right?;;
something like that yeah <@348165887347523594>;;
Just finished eating some German food here <@448648678224429068>;;
im sure that US cities dont give ashit about their capital for example;;
Dude, I'm a food adventurer and you made me hungry, problem is that in this small island you get no diversity <@488734758847905803>;;
It's a German town here;;
and in russia everything has to do with moscow. which is good for me since i live here;;
Ah true that <@348165887347523594>;;
Come visit Brazil;;
There are tons of different restaurants;;
<@207416847019016202> , yeah they usually don't care about the capitals;;
<@207416847019016202> Yeah, they just don't, I've lived in the US for a long time and it's not even a concept;;
<@488734758847905803> Will do, maybe a great project for my next vacations actually;;
my gf is already wants to go to brasil. or any warm place lol;;
Have you ever lived in another country <@207416847019016202> ?;;
Lol <@207416847019016202>;;
no <@348165887347523594> ;;
just in very different russia cities;;
<@207416847019016202> Brazil may be a bit of a leap though, It's too damn warm lol;;
Anyone of you guys come here I'll help out and /or meet up with you guys;;
Nice <@488734758847905803>;;
<@348165887347523594> , come in the spring / autumn;;
i mean on vacation <@348165887347523594>;;
It's very nice during those seasons;;
<@207416847019016202> Ok, well, Russia is Actually the biggest country by far in the world;;
Very comfortable weather;;
<@207416847019016202> ho yeah üòÖ;;
its actually very funny sometimes to look at map or in wiki, seeing that some europe countries almost smaller than moscow <@348165887347523594>;;
<@488734758847905803> When I use to live in the States, I would always get a cold when I'd come spend vacation in Martinique. The heat can actually give you a pretty bad cold;;
concept that in europe it get you several hours to get in other country, is crazy for me;;
its gets several hours in russia to get anywhere;;
<@207416847019016202> Yeah, lots of small European countries, even tiny compare to Russia, or the U.S(I don't like using the name America to refer to U.S);;
<@207416847019016202> yeah European countries are mostly smaller than states here too haha;;
Oh damn <@348165887347523594> - I never got a cold from warm weather lol;;
i dont mind name america, US just shorter;;
Same <@348165887347523594> - America is a damned continent;;
<@488734758847905803> I always do when I move from cold to warm;;
Interesting;;
<@488734758847905803> Exactly bro;;
There is a name for that in French, let me look up the english translation;;
I usually say US or the States;;
Ho, it's just called an Insolation <@488734758847905803>;;
<@488734758847905803> Yeah, me too, I was looking up the name of what I get when I move from cold to warm;;
Ahh true;;
Interesting;;
Spring and autumn are good seasons for you to travel then;;
<@207416847019016202> It probably means more when you actually live in America but not in the US....It feels like we're no-one;;
<@488734758847905803> Yep;;
one more funny thing about centralisation ;;
I dont know why, but when you fly from vladivostok (eastern part of russia, 9000 km, 7-8 hours flight from moscow), to, for example, Novosibirsk, which is kind of in the middle between Vladivostok and Moscow (4-5 hours flight from both cities), its aften more cheaper to buy 2 joint tickets, one from Vladivostok to Moscow (7-8 hours flight), and second from Moscow to Novosibirsk, and go half way back for 4-5 hours <@348165887347523594>;;
Yeah true;;
I don't know if you know, but what I've heard is that America was supposed to mean land of freed immigrants or something;;
And that's why it's called land of the free;;
I think they just forgot about their roots lol;;
<@207416847019016202> I got you;;
<@488734758847905803> This is what I think, it's worrying to see how much people got selfish. I thought that this was a sentiment shared by most. But these past years I don't know anymore;;
Damn <@207416847019016202>;;
in russia we have this huge discusting anti-america propaganda, exactly as they has against us, and both pisses me off;;
Here's a link Silver shared last night https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDzsSvFZhJ8&t=1701s;;
<@207416847019016202> I know man, it's crazy;;
also we have many problems with england for some reason;;
english press has hard on us;;
<@348165887347523594> - I think people in countries with less tend to have less selfish habits;;
At least in my experience;;
there s to many fake news and such;;
The leaders are turning us against each others;;
<@488734758847905803> True;;
exactly <@348165887347523594>;;
I'll check that out <@348165887347523594>;;
True <@207416847019016202> - the press is not Russia's friend at the moment;;
<@488734758847905803> Yeah, you should, very interesting video;;
I've got to go to the store guys. I'll be back later. Very awesome<@207416847019016202> <@488734758847905803>  discussion;;
what i really hate is problems between russia and ukraine. you may not know this, but russian and ukranians are like the same people in many kind of ways. its not like different cultures or something, its all very the same;;
<@207416847019016202> I know I've documentaries about it;;
i agree, awesome, <@348165887347523594> , good luck;;
Later üòâ;;
üòÖ;;
<@312590984037007361> , I'll put that in <#494741950575149056> , ok ? :);;
Good night guys, I'm back a the Airbnb;;
Yeah <@348165887347523594> and <@207416847019016202> it was great talking;;
Sorry to bail in the middle of the conversation;;
;;
Here's a beer made of my juice to make up for it;;
haha <@488734758847905803>;;
mango beer is weird;;
Is it also your shop?;;
<:callis3Hype:517038299857289216> <:callis3Hype:517038299857289216> <:callis3Hype:517038299857289216> <:callis3Hype:517038299857289216>;;
I‚Äôm having a lip sync stream right now;;
I have a few mango trees in my garden, and now I realize they won't ever taste the same anymore. This evening I went to take a leak as usual under that one tree I use to juice up for years now but something happened....I just couldn't go through it. All these mangos laying around me, this suffering, this innocence that has been violated for so long didn't deserve what was happening.  It just stroked me, never will I pee under this tree anymore. I realized that my dongle has a limited memory, and it can still be overwritten with something better, something cleaner. You have changed my life <@488734758847905803> . My dongle will be used only with respect from now onüòÖ;;
Morning;;
It's good  <@348165887347523594> that from now on you will not pee on  <@488734758847905803>;;
Morbong mangoes;;
<:PurpleMMMANGO:499310401465352197>;;
morning <@278571432588345345>;;

Morning guys! ;;

After that we'll be going to close to the places we're heading to, like 2-3 hours away tops;;

Good job <@!455797717763883009>, your dongle just grew to 6!;;
Don't forget to climb the tower and activate it once you set up base, so your map defogs xD;;
Ah I see lol;;
Lmao, yeah;;
Make sure to swoop the camera around 360 degrees;;
Didn't see that your dongle grew to 6 there <@455797717763883009>;;

by the way, thanks all who showed up, especially thanks <@217089479863697418>  for nice chat;;
i personally dont like when person is silent during stream, because i dont watch gameplay, i just listen, so i try not to be silent too;;
<@348165887347523594> if you noticed, when you say nice things to me, dongle grow faster;;
Same thing here, I don't like silent streams at all. But your narration was refreshing, made me want to know the whole story;;
hahahahaha, I noticed üòÇ;;
#nohomo;;
Ooo yeah! Dongle 6 üòé;;
i streamed this game last week, and at first thought that tons of text is boring, but then realized that with right accent its okay;;
"You almost brought tears to my eyes when you said ""i didnt know any important men""";;
<@278571432588345345> üòÇ;;
Yo  <@207416847019016202> lurked on your stream for a while. Looking forward to your Metro stream with that accent üòÇ;;

<@207416847019016202> True, I want the first seat when you'll stream the next metro.;;

<@207416847019016202> Toilet??? What are you talking about???;;
its a hole in the floor <@348165887347523594>;;
;;
My dongle makes beer now;;
;;
Also a pic with my family;;
thats hillarious picture <@488734758847905803>;;
You should stream dressed like that <@488734758847905803>;;
Lmao I wish;;
hahaha;;
<@207416847019016202> Dude you remind me of those Greek toilets, what nightmare;;
haha;;
i sent you picture of russian private sector yesterday. all those private old houses got toilet outside, its just liiitle building with a hole in the ground <@348165887347523594>;;
"Especially when you're far from home...I'm scared ""shitless"" when confronted to these situations";;
<@207416847019016202> God damn hahahahaha;;
I remember going to that outdoor party, and mother nature hit me with the realest reality check. Only greek toilets around, I was sweating bricks and was to the point where even moving my pinky finger was risky enough to make me explode. I wrecked these freaking toilets. I thought that the next person entering this bathroom would be left with PTSD .;;
Morning mangos;;
Haha reality check  <@348165887347523594>;;
Hi  <@287320205020102667>;;
How are u;;
I‚Äôm doing pretty good how about yourself;;
I'm Good, cause this is Saturday!;;
Lucky duck ü¶Ü I‚Äôm still at work lol I don‚Äôt get weekends off unless I take a weekend off;;
so how does it work? you just  register to some mobile and recieve orders for delivery? <@287320205020102667>;;
Post traumatic shit disorder <@348165887347523594>;;
Hey <@287320205020102667> , what up councilman?;;
council person;;
<@488734758847905803> why dont we have girls on council?;;
Not too much just driving along and you;;
<@207416847019016202> - no girls asked before the spots were taken;;
Will be driving today too <@287320205020102667>;;
You on vacation;;
These pictures made me jealous;;
I haven't gone on vacations for quite some time...like for ever;;
i was on vacation on world cup;;
actually at world cup i was at two france games <@348165887347523594>;;
dont know if you watching football;;
I watch football only for the world cup yeah;;
These times were crazy. The entire country was celebrating. One of the player is from Martinique <@207416847019016202>;;
wich player? <@348165887347523594>;;
Rapha√´l Varane, his home town is like 30 minutes from my house;;
yeah, im rootin fo real a little;;
congrats on world cup by the way;;
Thanks on behalf of France haha;;
Other than big events like World Cup, Euro Cup I don't fallow it much;;
I don't agree much with all the money flowing in the football industry. A team like PSG on it's own could save a third world country if they wanted. I don't get how we still see people starving all around the world and in the other side have football teams spending hundreds of millions on just one player sometimes. It just baffles me.;;
Well I don't mind spending tonn of money if you have it,and I don't much care about starving, but the way PSG generally behaves itself with all that money is not the way to become popular football club;;
I think many people laughing now on PSG;;
Looking at how the fail every year in Europe with all that money;;
And transfer of neymar from Barcelona to psg I think showed all bad sides of all three of them;;
I don't know much about the league though üòÖ;;
Good afternoon everyone üòä;;
Hi  <@486507510635823104>;;
How are you;;
I'm good how are you? üòÅ;;
I'm good;;
Good! What's that? ü§î;;
Haha;;
It's beer;;
Porter;;
It's not what they give you at mommy parties  <@486507510635823104>;;
They very small glasses üòÇüòÇ doesn't look like a pint at all üòÇ I don't like beer that much myself anymore üòÇ just wine or vodka üòÇ;;
Haha I don't drink vodka, I'm a bad russian;;
Happy Saturday! <:bingLove:449275405099204622>;;
<@514535788520669203> happy best day of the week!!;;
I agree <@207416847019016202> about the Neymar transfer. He's one of the players I hate the most;;
YOU DON'T DRINK VODKA <@207416847019016202>;;
?!;;
Get out;;
Sorry  <@488734758847905803>;;
I dont;;
I love beer and whiskey;;
Hey <@446411352035033089> ! Happy Saturday;;
Hey <@486507510635823104>;;
Hey <@514535788520669203>;;
How's your weekend so far?;;
Hello <@488734758847905803>;;
Hey <@498246547838992414> ! What up?;;
I'm doing good;;
I got my new pc today;;
<@207416847019016202>  your Russian and u don't drink vodka????? Are you ok??? üòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆ;;
Nice! Congrats!;;
Yeah thx;;
<@488734758847905803>  how u doing üòä;;
<@486507510635823104> He's playing with his dongle;;
I need to keep up with the conversation more I come in way to late sometime! <@498246547838992414>  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
I didn't drink anything at all until I was 27, so now it's at least half okay  <@486507510635823104> <@488734758847905803>;;
<@207416847019016202>  ah that's understandable üòä;;
I'm doing well <@486507510635823104> just driving;;
Oh cool <@207416847019016202> you're the opposite from me. I drank from 12-23;;
Then I quit drinking;;
I can't drink without exploding;;
I go kaboom when I have a beer;;
Guinness is alright though;;
I don't drink much, so no point for me to quit üòÇ  <@488734758847905803>;;
hey peeps, what's dongling?;;
<@348165887347523594> Nothin' much just danglin' ma dongle;;
Lmao;;
Weird, I'm doing the same exact thing here. You sound like a very smart person <@498246547838992414>;;
Just texting and driving #yolo;;
*crashes*;;
Just kidding, I'm in the super market getting a few things;;
Lmao  <@488734758847905803>;;
<@488734758847905803> lmao;;
<@348165887347523594> I am very smart;;
I knew it!!!;;
I've watched 1 episode of Rick and Morty;;
I'm basically Stephen Hawkin;;
Hahaha Rick and Morty is amazing;;
hahaha you would have to have someone danglin' that dongle for you right;;
If I weren't driving the car, I'd be driving my dongle;;
<@488734758847905803> hahahahaha omg;;
Is it me or discord is acting up;;
Discord is a bit iffy right now for me too;;
Lol I was on another discord server and discord did all kinds of weird stuff;;
I was in a place with bad connection and thought that it was my problem, but apparently it was discord;;
by the way, i finished Episode 1 of The Council yesterday;;
As in many episodic games, first episode is really good;;
Mango council;;
but i suspect some kind of downfall later;;
Probably;;
im myself episode of mango council, and i can assure you, it doesnt get worse <@498246547838992414>;;
Oh boy;;
<@207416847019016202> Is it on you twitch channel?;;
the council? <@348165887347523594>;;
sadly no;;
i would stream it, but i stream VERY rarely;;
I see;;
only when my gf leave appartment for at least 3-4 hours;;
because its not very comfortable tostream in small appartment;;
we have 1 room and no doors berween room and kitchen;;
I totally understand, so she would have to stay in the corner of the room;;
so if i would stream near her, she would need to listen all this 3-4 hours, and she couldnt turn on something she listen or watch;;
<@348165887347523594> exactly;;
Yeah, true, I don't even play online with the mic on so it doesn't bother the people around me;;
thats right, and if i stream with mic, i cant be silent, i need to really speak all the time so viewers woudnlt be bored;;
and it can be really annoying for person who is with you;;
True, and it can get weird right?;;
so i definitely will stream, i like it, but something like once a week, maximum;;
No pro;;
what kind of weird you mean? üòÄ;;
Well, crazy person talking alone weird üòÖ;;
haha;;
I'm just jocking, I'm so self aware that I'm afraid my neighbors could think that I'm going crazy when playing with the mic on;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 7!;;
actually, if you dont read name of viewer when you read his comment, it sounds like you just read questions out of your head;;
My dongle is on steroid, a real stallion;;
<@207416847019016202> true;;
<@348165887347523594> self awareness is much better than, you know, some weird people who like to speak on the phone very loudly in public places;;
especially with video;;
Haha indeed, the mango council will get awesome! <@207416847019016202>;;
<@207416847019016202> I always try to reach the nearest corner or someplace a little bit away from the crowd. And I never, ever stay or engage on a phone call on a line;;
"on a line you mean when phone says to you ""person speaking on another line""?";;
Omg people who talk loud on their phones in public suuuuuuck;;
yeah, I banged that chick so hard last night;;
Yeah great example <@488734758847905803> üòÇ;;
<@207416847019016202> No waiting to get to a counter;;
Like at the banc or in a store;;
Yeah;;
Lol yeah  <@488734758847905803>;;
Or listen to music out loud;;
Alwayd shit music too;;
<@278571432588345345> so true hahaha;;
Oh dude;;
Every bus I take;;
It's crazy, you wonder how the hell they don't realize how uncivilized and annoying it can be;;
Yeah crazy;;
No self awareness;;
i think <@488734758847905803> 's example was his usual phone talk;;
none what's so ever <@278571432588345345>;;
lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
Nah man he's a whipped mango;;
Settled down mango;;

- yeah, I banged that chick so hard last night;;
- mango, what the fuck, you are married;;

Hahahaah;;
Whip that mango lol;;
Nah, my wife is super chill;;
"as beatles sung, ""when i found myself in times of trouble, my big dongle came to me"" <@348165887347523594>";;
Hahaha that's the best thing you could say <@348165887347523594> , I love making people laugh and being around people who make me laugh;;
<@207416847019016202> üòÇ üòÇ;;
Like, my wife does none of those things you hear other guys's complain their wives do;;
<@488734758847905803> Same thing here man, same thing here;;
my wife doesn't let me hang out with my friends until after x time;;
haha, the usual stuff lol;;
Real talk here,;;
When my wife met me, I was a wreck. Poor af, had some issues and lost the house I was living in, I was still recovering from some personal shit;;
Cant hear you over the sound of the whip  <@488734758847905803>;;
She and her family gave me a chance to get better;;
LMFAO;;
Jk man :);;
Hahahaahhaahahahah;;
Omg that was the best timing for that joke;;
You guys look good together;;
Thanks :);;
<@278571432588345345> put your whip away and maybe you will hear something;;
Hahaha;;
HAHAHAHA;;
Or come join us;;
Lol jk;;
Its hers man;;
Only the women whip;;

Hahaha;;
Lol;;

My wife says that if I were cooler we could;;
But I have to be this cool to ride, and I'm about 2 meters uncool;;
Hahaha;;
haha, that is nice;;
lol;;
So guess what happened today? We got a flat tire hahaha;;
Brand new tires went flat lol;;
So we're a bit late;;
But that's ok;;
Oups, that sucks, but makes life spicier;;
Also, <@278571432588345345> , how'd you like gow today?;;
Or is that tomorrow?;;
Yeah;;
Tomorrow;;
Bad luck man;;
Shit happens;;
"I said ""at least it wasn't an accident, so we got rid of the bad luck statistic early""";;
Ah true;;
Feels like forever ago that you said that haha;;
<@488734758847905803> If you don't mind me being curious, how hold are you?;;
i think that he is 28, but can be wrong;;
I'm the oldest around here then;;
I'm 28;;

37 is old;;
and im very young, just 33;;
Damn you look rly young  <@348165887347523594>;;
Yeah, but you would have no idea if you saw me;;
<@278571432588345345> Yeah, everyone says so;;
Good work dude;;
Thanks lol, say that to my parents haha;;
I wanna stay young also;;
Yeah genes are what they are;;
Age is just a number;;
Gotta stay healthy though;;
Fuck those numbers up the arse;;
I'm workinh on my pull ups;;
If we were alive 200 years ago we'd be senior fucking citizens;;
You all look like you're 20;;
Got to 10 reps lets go;;
"My student the other day said ""are you 40?""";;
"<@488734758847905803> statistic says that bigger that ""just number"", the shittier you look üòÄ";;
I was like, bitch I'd be your dad if I were 40;;
True, and seems that 40 now is like 25 of last century;;
Yeah, for sure exercise is important;;
<@488734758847905803> üòÇ;;
Nice <@278571432588345345> ! Keep it up;;
Lets go <@278571432588345345>;;
keep it up, keep getting old;;
Hahaha I mean, people age so much better now don't ya think <@207416847019016202> ?;;
<@488734758847905803> So true;;
haha i age not so good, and i also age pretty fat, so im not sure <@488734758847905803>;;
I think you look young good dude;;
I saw your stream;;
<@207416847019016202> üòÇ , I thought you were 27;;
Weight is a matter of exercise and diet, not age;;
hat and headphones is solution for everything;;
I know my beard makes me look old;;
<@207416847019016202> üòÇ;;
Older*;;
Hahaha;;
That's my true faxe;;
Face*;;
Its a good beard dude;;
Ah damn the signal;;
I wear glasses;;
Mango has a hawt beard;;
Thanks;;
i know that weight is not strictly connected to age, but some way it is. i was 63 kgs all my life before 26-27, without any exercises and such. and after that age weight started growing haha;;
<@488734758847905803> I was going to say that I have little to no facial hear, just the under my chin ...It may be why I look this young;;
It's my best feature;;
Well metabolism changes with age;;
So need more exercise to maintain;;
True <@348165887347523594>;;
That's right <@278571432588345345>;;
yeah it changes <@278571432588345345>;;
yep;;
One time a guy asked me how old I was, when I said my age, he had a shock on his face and said to me, I honestly thought you were 25;;
I was 14 at the time;;
Damn lol;;
He must be blind;;
It get harder with age, but manageable, just don't wait too much <@207416847019016202>;;
I'm assuming you have a beard?;;
I have had a beard  since I was about 15;;
<@498246547838992414> üòÇ;;
Lil one, since I was 13;;
haha im too lazy, i never tried to manage it and dont think i will soon <@348165887347523594>;;
So I always bought alcohol and shit no problem;;
It helps make you feel better mentally too <@207416847019016202>;;
Well its brazil dude;;
I don't drink, and probably never will;;
I bought booze at 12 years old lol;;
I've seen stuff;;
Hahaahha;;
dudes, dont want to disappoint everyone, but i never feel bad mentally <@488734758847905803>;;
<@278571432588345345> üòÇ;;
But that was in the 70s <@278571432588345345> , it was a different time;;
hahahahaha;;
Haha;;
Now they actually check your ID;;
That's not disappointing, that's awesome <@207416847019016202>;;
JK jonny;;
even in mother russia they check your ID, sometime when you 30 years old and with beard;;
70s lol;;
Good job <@!278571432588345345>, your dongle just grew to 8!;;
Woo;;
Ooooooo shit;;
Here the legal drinking age is 16, so I could technically buy like 50 crates of jup;;
#growth;;
Got up to 8;;
<@278571432588345345> put away your dongle, dont flash it;;
Lol <@498246547838992414>;;
Hahaha;;
I'm not kidding;;
I might some day add a measurement after the number;;
<@207416847019016202> Martinique has the award wining best Rhum of the World and I think third best beer in the world, checking IDs isn't even a concept;;
I believe you <@498246547838992414>;;
Hahahahaha damn <@348165887347523594>;;
Even Brazil does that;;
I think it should be higher, but that's my opinion;;
"<@488734758847905803> i said ""disappoint"" because i noticed how people love to bond over all this sad shit like ""i was depressed, oh yeah man, i understand, i was too"" üòÄ";;
Though granted it became much harder over the last 10 years;;
Ah I see;;
I have had issues with anxiety;;
<@348165887347523594> haha;;
also in russia we have law that forbids to sell alcohol after 11 pm;;
But I prefer to hear that people haven't had it;;
I don't wish it against my worst enemies;;
Well we do have laws that forbids to sell alcohol after 10 here, but it doesn't matter much;;
Anxiety sucks;;
Yeah it does;;
haha that one phrase that i never understood. i would wish my enemies all the worst in the world üòÄ;;
Hahaha;;
I don't;;
Good job <@!437267691200446476>, your dongle just grew to 6!;;
<@488734758847905803> I have serious PTSD, and I had a very dark time with alcohol;;
I don't have enemies;;
I try to think of them as unevolved people;;
There's people i dislike;;
Who are worthy of pity;;
Damn <@348165887347523594> , I am very sorry to hear that;;
I have some issues from my past as well;;
<@348165887347523594> in russia this law actually matter sometime. of course you have some local small shops that do it illegally, but mostly all the shops dont even have ability to sell it through cash register, so most shops dont do it;;

Now, every level up is very important, so many jokes;;
Yeah that was  haha;;
So glad I made that joke;;
Thanks for choosing the word dongle Hitman lol;;

Story wise and fun wise at least;;
I know rdr2 has more details and stuff to do though;;
Anyways, after sleeping for about 8 hours, which is about  an hour and a half more than what I usually need, we woke up to a really beautiful place;;
Will take a pic soon;;

Get yours rdy dude;;
<@207416847019016202> lol, it's the theory of god dongle that applies to me üòÉ;;
Lets go <@278571432588345345>;;
The One, Chosen by Master Dongle;;
<@207416847019016202> Thanks for the compliment, well I take it as a compliment about my picture;;
<@207416847019016202> hahaha;;
One dongle to rule them all;;
<@278571432588345345> lmao;;
One dongle to bring them together and bind them in darkness;;
The one dongle of power;;
My prrrecious;;
<@488734758847905803> we are talking about your dongle;;
lol <@278571432588345345>;;
the god dongle;;
<@348165887347523594> np, its a compliment, as soon as you dont want to look older;;
<@207416847019016202> hehe;;
By the way, do you plan on streaming again the game you were playing yesterday. You've explained why you're not streaming oftenly but do you plan on it <@207416847019016202> ?;;
yeah, next time ill stream, i will stream that game, Atom RPG. <@348165887347523594> ;;
first time i started stream it, i thought it was too slow and dull for stream, but then realized that reading lot of text with proper accent can be okay;;
so until ill got some strong requests or objections, ill stick to it;;
It felt like listening to an audio book;;
<@348165887347523594> , as the prophecy foretold hahaha;;
Lmao <@278571432588345345> hahahaha;;
All our dongles grow if we put them together;;
ü§î;;
My prrrrecious dongle;;
It loves ua;;
Us*;;
<@348165887347523594> haha, I don't listen audio books myself, but I like listen all kind of let's plays, just to listen voice;;
Me too, <@207416847019016202>  you know what, every time I go to sleep or just want to relax, I put on Art Bell audio archives. It's no gameplay but I find it very pleasant and appeasing;;
Its usually takes me less than a minute to fell asleep, so even if im turn on some song for example, I will be gone before chorus  <@348165887347523594>;;
<@207416847019016202> haha lucky you üòÉ;;
<@348165887347523594> , ever try asmr?;;
I didn't know about asmr <@488734758847905803> , I've just googled it though. Will be reading about it;;
Dude I love that;;
Lemme send you one that I really like;;
https://youtu.be/86BMT1ZdM7Y;;

And, you said you appreciate the attention earlier, you don't have to, it's a request üòÇ I don't care about your feelings <@207416847019016202>;;

I remember yes;;
But I'm so stupid that I thought Martinique is some kind of France state;;
It is actually;;
It's like Puerto - Rico is a state of the U.S;;
But an island;;
I also thought that it's with in france territory I mean;;
Martinique is the same. But when we were talking last time I was indeed talking of when I lived on the main land;;

Food poisoning, a cold and a throat infection all at once;;
Hiya <@498246547838992414> how are ya;;

<@348165887347523594> Thanks, how are you doin' ?;;
Well hope you feel better. I had a bad night myself last night;;
<@287320205020102667> Damn, hope everyone gets better;;
Idk if I even go to school tomorrow;;
It did. I had got stuck in the snow last night. Finally got out at 3 am this morning and I also got a 165 ticket for failure to maintain control in the damn snow. Accused of damaging a guard rail when I know damn well I didn‚Äôt hit it;;
<@287320205020102667> Oh no, that's horrible;;
Yeah not to happy but hey I‚Äôm fine now. I ate. I slept. Life goes on right;;
Lol;;
Lmao;;
Here we don't get snow anymore;;
üò¢;;
Where I am from there is no snow but for work. I go all over so yeah;;
Ah, so you're like a truck driver or something like that;;
<@498246547838992414> food poisoning is really suck;;
<@287320205020102667> is it some automatic systems, that detects damaging guard rail?;;
Yes <@498246547838992414>;;
<@207416847019016202> I know, I spent last night half out of bed with my head nearly inside a bucket;;
There may be some <@207416847019016202> but in this case it was simply him going over looking and saying yup you did it. When he was looking at the bumper of the trailer which clearly was a few inches above the railing lol;;
and who is him? road policeman? <@287320205020102667>;;
Ohio State trooper <@207416847019016202>;;
some kind of local police as i understand;;
didnt know about those;;
Ah okay;;
phew, long  day again;;
damn <@287320205020102667> i'm really sorry to hear those cops messed with you;;
Yeh it happens I just hate I have to piss 165 dollars down the drain;;
Yeah that sucks for sure;;
<@498246547838992414> Hey, sorry about that I didn't notice you answered. I'm pretty good thanks. Regular Sunday at home. Some house cleaning, then lots of surfing the web üòÉ;;
<@348165887347523594> That's no problem, glad you're doing well;;
How are u all;;
Sup <@207416847019016202> , trying to find some sleep, meanwhile I've been watching episodes of Netflix's travelers . How are you?;;
Heading to work;;
You just made me travel far away from home. So thank you ha;;
Make another one;;
Here you go. Quality isn't good, cause I make photo on the go through train dirty window  <@348165887347523594>;;
ho wow man. Nice thanks. Beautiful;;
Good luck at work. And good day brother;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 9!;;
There's no snow in Martinique I guess?;;
You made my dongle grow up üòÇ üòÇ;;
Haha;;
<@207416847019016202> No never;;
It's hot all year long, sun or rain, that's all we get üò¶;;
Well we don't get a lot of snow, comparing to northern regions. Its here all winter, but not a lot, just at your feet level;;
I know for you it must be the usual stuff, but from my point of view it's fucking beautiful;;
What do you build snowman from? Dirt?;;
üòä;;
üòÇ üòÇ;;
LMAO!!!!!;;
I can't get back at you on this one loool;;
I'm dying here;;
What s usual temperature there? 30?;;
Yeah;;
Exactly this;;
Man, I miss seasons;;
When I was in Turkey, there was sun battery and barrel with water on every house. Do they do this in Martinique?;;
You mean a solar heater?;;
For hot water;;
Barrel for a hot water, solar battery for a electricity;;
Here we have solar battery on every houses but it's used to heat water. Only certain structures have solar batteries all over their roofs for electricity. Usually companies.;;
Or warehouses;;
Well maybe in Turkey its also mostly for water, I don't know, but for water I think mostly barrels;;
Because barrels is really on every house;;
Yeah the solar water heaters all have water barrels hooked to it on the roof. I forgot to mention it. I think that's what you've seen .;;
It's dark but let me see if I can take a quick picture;;
;;
Good job <@!207416847019016202>, your dongle just grew to 17!;;
That's my picture from turkey;;
And that's ma dongle;;
Our dongles are in sync;;
üòÇ;;
;;
It's hard to see but you should get an idea;;
It's on top of my garage, so hard to make a clear picture, and it's night time;;
Yeah;;
It think that it's the same thing but with bigger water barrels since mine is for a single house;;
Maybe;;
But I think I read somewhere that it used not just for water, but I can be wrong;;
Doesn't barrel heat up only from sun at day?;;
Here, it cost 1 symbolic euro to get one. The government pays  for it.;;
One day of sun heats up for days, I don't know how long but very long;;
For electricity you would need an entire roof covered of solar panel. And it would still be limited;;
haha;;
i get it;;
it was actually funny, ive been in turkey 2 times in 2017, first in august, when its like 30-35+, and second in november-december, when its 15-20-25;;
there i was, in light summer jacket and shorts, and most of the locals in warm winter coats;;
in +15 lol;;
hahaha, yeah man, here, when it's 20 Celsius people get cold lol;;
<@348165887347523594> btw, today might be unplanned stream, in 8 hours from now üòÄ;;
I see you didnt find sleep yet;;
Ok bro, normally I should be able to be here;;
Not yet, told you I usually don't sleep much üòÇ;;
i dont like to sleep either;;
waste of time;;
go to sleep at 4 am and wake up at 9 and go to work is ideal for me;;
It's seems good;;
I don't have a fixed schedule. I work a lot at home. I only go on site when things are critical. Like when I can't access a pc or server remotely. Or when I have a meeting. I worked most of my life in the intention of having less and less work to do after.  So, now I have a fair amount of spare time;;
Sometimes I regret not having a normal job where I get to go to an office everyday.;;
haha i would prefer to work grom home all the time;;
I hear you haha...But, staying home all the time isn't so healthy;;
Aren't you at work? Cause I can see you're playing games right now üòÖ;;
haha;;
i often have no tasks, so at these times a play cards game;;
we have differenet amount of work all the time;;
I see, reminds me when I use to work at the airport;;
"we have 4 programmers, and some weeks or months its like kill me, and sometimes, like now, its ""me, give task me, me""";;
haha I hear you lol;;
You're a programmer?;;
its all depends on our different clients projects and their statuses;;
"and right now most of projects in status ""waiting while client side will finish their part""";;
yeah, im in IT about 6 years, and last 1-2 years im programmer;;
This is pretty neat;;
It can be pretty annoying actually;;
"its like ""we've got new requirement, we need to change logic for our integration web service, okay, we need 2 hours for it, okay, 5, and with tests - we need one day""";;
and after that we will wait 2 weeks while clients do their part;;
I see;;
Morning mango dongles;;
True that <@207416847019016202>;;
My job can also get annoying because of clients and deadlines;;
haha yeah;;
morning <@488734758847905803>;;
my annoyance these days is mainly because of there is a little work;;
Ah yeah. The start of the year is always bad for most businesses;;
Do you get paid for each project you work on?;;
Do you get paid for each project you work on?;;
Or do you have a fixed salary?;;
Or do you have a fixed salary?;;
Ah yeah. The start of the year is always bad for most businesses;;
i got every your message 2 times üòÄ;;
Omg the signal here is so bad and it spammed my message hahaah;;
yeah;;
first of all, my absense of work has a little with new years start, its just coincedence, that for current clients everything works fine and theres little extra development, and potential new clients are on the way;;
second - yeah, i got fixed salary, no matter how many tasks or projects i had (or how much ive spent at office, or if i even showed up), but sometimes i get different bonuses, for some projects, after client paid for it;;
Oh I see;;
So, in one way it's good to not have more work;;
And in another it's bad;;
Do you think about working in a different country someday?;;
sometimes i think about living in different country, but only because i love idea of new yourk and would love live there, exactly how i love living in moscow;;
but other from that i dont want to randomly change my living country;;
Yeah, a random country would definitely suck imo too;;
i mean, many people want (or do) relocate in small europe country, or some technical advanced asian country, or some tropical island and work from there;;
but all that not for me;;
i want big crazy city;;
and Moscow one of the biggest in the world;;
for me mentally its like little copy of NEw York;;
so im generally okay with that;;
I see. I want a place that isn't a crazy city but has all the advantages of a city;;
Like good internet and hospitals;;
And good supermarkets;;
I liked the craziness of Sao Paulo before too;;
But now it's just too dangerous;;
Well theres pretty safe here, so no point for me yet to change something;;
of course we have all these russian inner political problems, stupid new laws and shit, everything bad, but for now it doesnt apply to me in any way;;
I see. Then yeah, I wouldn't necessarily move either;;
But stuff here is getting ridiculous and expensive;;
And more dangerous by the day;;
yeah that sucks <@488734758847905803>;;
and speaking about that lack of work can be bad... do they have anticafes in Brasil?;;
maybe it called different;;
in russia we have this anticafes, its basically like cafe, but without menu or any food, just free tea with cookies.;;
You only pay for time that you spent there, and you can do anything you want - play board games, play consoles, bring your laptop and work;;
basically, place to chill;;
Hahahaha I wish there was something like that in Brazil;;
That sounds awesome;;
There's a place called a work cafe or something;;
And then you pay for the time you spend there and also they serve coffee and food;;
well we have those too, called something like coworking;;
Yeah;;
That's what it's called;;
what i wanted to say, is that i hate idea of anticafe, because this place trying to look and feel like home;;
but IT IS NOT;;
i have my home to feel like home;;
so about work... i work from home, and theres no work. of course it is perfect. i can do whatever i want, i can play games, sleep, eat, watch movies, even play guitar once a year;;
but when im at work, i am already got here, so im not basically at home;;
i cant do a lot of things;;
yeah, i can play some game, that my laptop can handle, but thats all;;
so idea of lack of work when you already waste your time to go to office, is not to good;;
But free food is nice haha;;
I mean, I wouldn't go there on a regular basis;;
But it would be nice to have a place where others could go;;
Because many people here don't have space at home;;
Hey everyone;;
Sorry been MIA got a lot on plate with IRK stuff;;
hi <@436313570926395407>;;
let me google IRK...;;
no, nothing...;;

IRL üòÇüòÇ I was trying to wash dishes type and talk on the phone üòÇüòÇ;;
haha;;
all that goole said to me about IRK is russian city named Irkutsk;;
üíÄüíÄ;;
<@207416847019016202> , I think he meant IRL;;
In real life;;

Those soap operas are the worst;;

Ah -2 isn't too bad <@207416847019016202>;;

Cool. What are you planning on playing? <@459504171113250837>;;

Fuck autocorrect;;
It's not Syberia i meant;;
But it's not sugar either;;
Hey hey @everyone how are you all doing today ???;;
Ah true <@207416847019016202>;;

Sounds like fun and I‚Äôm jealous lol;;
How long you will be in trip Mango !!?;;
I'll be away from home until the 24th;;
So I'll miss the first few days of your streamee of the week streams;;
But I know @everyone will make up for that in my absence;;
But then while I'm home I'll be supporting the hell out of your entire stream;;
It‚Äôs ok real life always come first anyway;;
Streamer of the week IS MY LIFE hahaha;;
I will be same with every other streamer after me;;
Nah, but I planned ahead and stuff to be available;;
Try to post a schedule in <#525283886037467137> so we can all be there on time;;
As much as I could of course depending the time zone;;
Yeah I will do that Wednesday and post it after I planned it;;
Yeah, post it in your own timezone and I'll figure out the timezone for others;;
Like, I think you're 4 hours ahead of me right now;;
Yes;;
So that means you're 7 ahead of the us on the east coast;;
And I think only 2 ahead of the uk;;
Only 1 hour ahead of il;;
Uk üá¨üáß;;
its pretty complicated i think. On the left - Moscow. On the right - Novosibirsk (–ù–æ–≤–æ—Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫). As you can see, its not way norther than Moscow. But starting from december it -35 there at least <@488734758847905803>;;
hi <@502171199850414081> <@287320205020102667>;;

Oh true <@207416847019016202> ! ;;
I love geography and stuff;;
<@498246547838992414> hayyyyy;;
Oh I see <@459504171113250837>   I'm excited to see your streams with overlays and stuff;;
Hey <@498246547838992414> ! What up bro?;;
I m so bad at geography üòû;;
I have bronchitis;;
Oh shit <@498246547838992414> get well soon;;
<@502171199850414081>  , being bad and liking something are two entirely separate things hahahaha. I'm bad at geography too, but j find it very interesting;;
<@502171199850414081> Thanks!!;;
Damn dude. That sucks <@498246547838992414>;;
True <@488734758847905803> you‚Äôre right !!! You are the voice of wisdom;;
I have asthma, so I know the value of breathing;;
<@488734758847905803> I know right, you leave for 1 week, and I'm already dying;;
Hahahaha I would not say that at all <@502171199850414081> but I appreciate the kind words;;
I'll be back soon <@498246547838992414>;;
Perhaps even today I'll do a stream I just chatting depending on my signal;;
Yeet;;
A just chatting *;;
Ooh you know what;;
What?;;
I had an awesome idea;;
Yeah?;;
I love those;;
Well I think it is ...;;
Well now if it's not I'm banning you for hyping me up;;
BETTER MAKE IT GOOD;;
We need to find someone who will stream a haunted place !!!!!???;;
Ooooooo;;
I am a scaredy cat;;
But I'd find it interesting to see for sure haha;;
<@502171199850414081> <@510594499202908160> maybe???;;
Med?;;
I can't type well on a phone;;
So you keep me <@488734758847905803> for now lol ??;;
Hahaha yes <@502171199850414081>;;
That was good enough of an idea lmao;;
That would be awesome to watch;;
My alpa male hands are too large for this *PUNY PHONE*;;
;;
LMAO <@498246547838992414>;;
<@488734758847905803> Oh daamn, looks pretty;;
A streamer friend of mine leaves in Alaska and would be ok to do it because I mean Alaska is the best place for haunted places no ?!;;
It looks very European;;
Is it <@502171199850414081> ?;;
I didn't know;;
I thought European castles were;;
It‚Äôs gorgeous where you are;;
<@488734758847905803> If it were all european castles, I'd be screwed;;
In France we have lot of tv series and emissions with haunted story from Alaska;;
Belgium has the largest concentration of castles per square mile in Europe (maybe the world idk);;
Then find a Castel and chase ghost while streaming <@498246547838992414> ??;;
<@502171199850414081> Oh god, no;;
They're all under protection and off limits;;
And I dislike castles in general;;
Shit damn ok then back to Alaska I guess;;
<@502171199850414081> There are however in some forests here some really creepy huts and houses;;
Probably from the war;;
Ooo ü§î sounds interesting !!!;;
Forests here are really creepy;;
Because most of them near smaller villages are really unkept;;
And look abandoned;;
Oh i see ! Here they keep them clean as much as possible for the fires during summer as I live near the French Riviera;;
<@502171199850414081> Oh nice, Belgium doesn't have anything remotely touristic other than the cities;;
But about the forests, It's still Belgium we're talking about here;;
Nothing happens here;;
Yeah but during summers you are safe it‚Äôs nice !! Not being afraid that wind or heat will light up a fire in a forest sometimes it‚Äôs too animated here;;
That's true, Belgium really is lucky, we don't really get natural disasters;;
Like Earthquakes, tornadoes, and large scale fires don't really happen often;;
Or even ever;;
Don‚Äôt forget floods ... we had some bad ones recently üòû;;
Yeah, France isn't doing too great from what little I know from watching the news;;
Oh well France is making talking about ourselves from lot of things recently ... riots-president-police- even here we feel overwhelmed so I guess how others can feel watching all the bad from outside !!;;
Yeah, I don't really watch the news but I heard a lot about riots and stuff, we had a little drama of our own here, but nothing really to that scale as in France;;
Good job <@!498246547838992414>, your dongle just grew to 6!;;
Thx  <@159985870458322944>;;
I love forests <@498246547838992414>;;
I mean;;
If they look super scary I don't;;
But I love trees and stuff;;
Same here <@498246547838992414> about the natural disasters;;
Brazil at the most gets floods;;
Don't know if it was today or yesterday, but happy birthday <@132996055267540992> !;;

Good afternoon;;
Good job <@!395311503131148288>, your dongle just grew to 1!;;
hi <@395311503131148288>;;
<@207416847019016202> I was able to watch for a while. But my connection to twitch is horrible. It seems that I can only watch 480p streams. I did't want you to have to downgrade you stream even more. I was so pissed I went and subscribed to an additional 4g connection which gives me now 12mb/s download. But I still can barely download at 4mb/s on twitch. Tested my download speed on other sites  and I get a nice 10mb/s download. I'm still working on a solution.;;
hm;;
who knows, is there an option to set up my stream that viewers would be able to choose?;;
You have to be affiliate. I can watch jonny's and abssii's for exemple. I set it to auto and it dynamically chooses between 780 and 480.;;
got it;;
when, i cant get lower than 720p;;
It's weird cause Saturday morning I was able to watch you stream flawlessly;;
i dont want to i mean;;
It's totally normal man;;
maybe heres some problems at my side, i dont know. i watched form my laptop, and it had same problems;;
but then i switched to other streams from laptop, and there was problems too;;
Ho yeah? I can't say, I know there is a problem on my side;;
<@207416847019016202> I see;;
so i hope next time it will be better;;
and i hope problem not at my side üòÄ;;
mr ketcham said it was all right for him;;
Yeah, I've been reading some stuff about blocking some ip's to get a much better connection to twitch. I'll dig into it;;
Yeah it was fine for him;;
Good night <@502171199850414081> !!;;
Hey <@514535788520669203> !;;
Hey <@395311503131148288>  how are ya?;;
Hey <@348165887347523594> , how are ya dude?;;
<@348165887347523594> is now officialy my top lurker. always there, never saying a word;;
so to affiliate you need 50 followers.. ill go ask around people on the street;;
good time for that, midnight;;
fuck;;
you wouldnt believe how stupid i am;;
i JUST realised that <@348165887347523594> and kellyd972 is the same guy;;
i read your name on stream, and didnt recognised it because of numbers, but i DIDNT read the numbers, so you think i would recognised it..;;
but no...;;
i dont know how its possible;;
<@207416847019016202> üòÇ omg are you serious???;;
forgive me;;
i dont know what have gotten into me;;
"and there i was thinking like ""why kellyd isnt showing up""";;
i was too obsessed with technical problems i guess;;
No problem bro, totally understandable haha;;
I was there almost the entire time. Didn't want to talk because of my connection. I wanted to focus on your narrative;;
haha;;
i found that 18 page book in the end;;
i love lore, but these days i would never fully read it off stream;;
"but on stream im like ""let them suffer""";;
Hahaha, and you noticed you had like 8 viewers until the end. And it was a pretty long stream;;
yeah;;
what a perverts;;
üòÄ;;
üòÖ;;
its like 2 side thing that twitch doesnt show who watching you;;
at one side, its good because people can lurk and not feel obliged to say hi or something;;
TRUE;;
"at other side, its like ""fuck are those real people? i want to look them in the eyes and ask WHY?""";;
I find it so funny when takedown pauses the game and reads out loud the names of the viewers not talking hahahaha....Then he says now we know you no need to hide üòÇ;;
you can see them if you affiliate?;;
Rephrase that, I'm not sure I understood;;
when i stream, i cant (or dont know how) look viewer names, until they write something in chat;;
right?;;
"and then you said something like ""takedown  read names of those who dont talk""";;
I don't know how he does it;;
okay;;
You should be able to see the users no?;;
if you are, then i dont know where üòÄ;;
You should ask <@488734758847905803> when you get a chance;;
yeah, when mango god will come to us;;
and bless us with his dongle;;
I can't wait for him to sprinkle his mango juice on our faces with with big dongle;;
well im not ready for that yet üòÄ;;
üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;
LMAO guys;;
Holy shit that conversation changed really quick hahahaha;;
There might be another way, but the way I know is to use streamlabs chatbot;;
Then it shows all your viewers;;
okay got it;;
i will dig into it;;
Yeah it helps with other stuff too;;
Like shoutouts;;
And other commands;;
yesterday night was the first time when i opened all those streamlabs settings <@488734758847905803>;;
and set up alerts and such;;
so next time i will check out bot;;
<@488734758847905803> LMAO;;
<@207416847019016202> Once you're affiliate it's a whole lot easier to watch your videos. Especially for people like me.;;
well as i said, ill go out on the street right now at night and will make people to follow me <@348165887347523594>;;
@everyone - drop <@207416847019016202> a follow so he can reach affiliate;;
hey hey;;
If half the people in here do that he'll have enough;;
please dont do that;;
i want my first time to be special;;
Hahaha;;
You're always active in here and you're also a council member;;
Council of Dongles;;
well id still like people to follow me on their own will üòÄ;;
Council members have the biggest Dongles;;
Well, maybe they don't know you're streaming now;;
They do <@498246547838992414>;;
Councilmembers' dongles grow 5 dongle lenghts automatically when they join the council;;
Oh damn;;
God damn that's so big;;
I want my dongle to be so large it can support my ceiling;;
üòÇ;;
Hahahaahahha;;
It'll support a whole damn building complex over here;;
It'll keep the moon in space;;
Hahahahahahahaahha;;
Omg;;
That was great;;
It'll keep me from tipping over;;
Use it as a cane;;
I'll use it as that the hammer from Getting over it;;
Hahahaha;;
I will never have to use stairs again;;
Lmao;;
Just one great swinging leap;;
Like just cause;;
üòÇ omg;;
<@207416847019016202> It's true what <@488734758847905803> said, maybe they don't know. Once they know they'll make the choice to keep fallowing or not. But at least getting affiliate will give more people the chance to appreciate your streams. Which are really fun. And like I said before, I don't give a damn about your feelings, I like it and I want more!!! üòÖ;;
haha <@348165887347523594>;;
actually i got very good internet for so many years, that it even doenst comes to my mind that internet could be a problem;;
i usually can easily have opened and muted some youtube stream, and couple of twitch streams, also turned on and muted, never having troubles;;
Takedown said hi...could you say hi <@207416847019016202> . He said he's gonna check out your streams by the way;;
He said your name out loud lol...He does it all the time to viewers not saying hi lol;;
Haha;;
Jonny raided him so I ended up there;;
I see lol;;
He is very funny;;
Streams with <@160543395037708288> a lot;;
Usually if I don't watch someone, I still leave stream opened;;
I see;;
He makes some pretty funny jokes;;
its funny, althouth i love isometric rpgs, i cant say if i would like this game, if played it off stream <@348165887347523594>;;
"because im not at all on this ""return isometric fallout"" train";;
"for me games like this is like ""huh, another clone""";;
usually im interested in fantasy isometric RPGs;;
Hm;;
Like final fantasy <@207416847019016202> ?;;
The old ones at least;;
haha no <@488734758847905803>;;
final fantasy for me is no way for me isometric RPGs;;
i beat all of them and love them all;;
but when i say fantasy isometric rpgs, i mean baldurs gate, icewind dale, planescape torment, divinity original sin, pillars of eternity;;
Ohhhh;;
I see what you mean now;;
Like the dialogue options and the art style, camera view and such;;
Then yeah, final fantasy isn't an isometric;;
Pillars of eternity is a great game. Haven't finished it yet;;
Well no, isometric is point of view, and I don't remember any isometric ff;;
They usually have camera somewhere above;;
But well of course, dialogues and style adds up too;;
Basically what I meant is called CRPG;;
Hm;;
I see;;
Which was your favorite?;;
Honestly I don't know, I love them all in some way  <@488734758847905803>;;
I didn't finished first divinity and first pillars yet;;
But I definitely will;;
And then will play second ones;;
Same;;
Also I didn't finished Baldur gate 2;;
"But all these games for me like ""I will definitely finish them""";;
Never played baldurs;;
I played tyranny recently and very liked it;;
Hahaah yeah I do that all the time, then it takes me years to play;;
Yeah?;;
I bought it on sale;;
I dreamed of playing Baldur since it came out, but couldn't because it required 32 mb ram, And i had 16, and  that time requirements had more importance, I simple couldn't play it;;
Then I played it finally in 2007 but didn't finished;;
And then played and finished couple years ago;;
Nice. ;;
Is the story good?;;
"Hard to tell, I'm very bad at detecting good story in RPG. If game has dialogues, and especially cut scenes, for me it's ""okay, I already love it"". And if story is bad, I will not notice it";;
But from the old rpgs I would definitely recommend landscape torment;;
It has more engaging character;;
I'll check it out;;
Did you play ffxv?;;
By the way they all has enhanced edition now;;
Yeah I played 15, and story of 4 boys didn't get me;;
There only one thing I can detect - if games has love story;;
And 15 in my opinion doesnt;;
But generally 15 is okay for me like any other such game;;
but i had this one problem with ff15;;
ill try not to spoil, but anyone who didnt played, please dont read;;
ff15 has this huge turning point in the middle of the game, and all the open worlding ends, and then its just linear story;;
im okay with that, but i didnt get to play much of the open world before that turning point, and i didnt find that time travel excuse belivable;;
i mean, after all that happened in the middle of the game, i didnt want to relive open world moments;;
so i got huge part of game unfinished;;
and now ill try to explain why i didnt finished many quests before turning point. ;;
in many open world games you finish one main story quest, and receive another, and usually there some distance between them, like you need to ride half of the map to do next main story quest. and while you do it, you usually switch to side quests;;
but ff15 at some point just started give main story quests one near another;;
and i just did them, and had no ability or desire to switch to side quests;;
and then BOOM - turning point in the game;;
Yeah the same thing happened to me;;
I liked the story of the four friends;;
That was the best part;;
Imo;;
But;;
I hated the fact that it was a multi-platform story;;
watch this movie;;
play this other game;;
Like fuck you dude. I want the story told to me in a single place;;
And the story about the kingdom was very weak. It has potential but it was very weak;;
And yeah, after I reached the turning point, I didn't do anything in the open world;;
yeah <@488734758847905803>;;
"for me it was like ""sorry dude that we ruined story, here is poor excuse to come back""";;
fuck you, i dont want your stupid time travel;;
i watched anime series, but didnt watch that movie, kings glaive or something like that;;
but still, my main problem, how can you, monsters, come up with very beautiful girl, and not make love story as main story in the game;;
like, i dont give a fuck about your boy bond problems, show me the girl;;
but here are they, going on about their bromance;;
Hahahahaha;;
I loved the bromance personally;;
It was the best part of the game imo;;
Combat sucked so bad;;
But yeah;;
well i also never notice quality of combat or rpg mechanics;;
its there, and im okay;;
Really?;;
All I did was smash square haha;;
i really suck at analyze what system is better;;
they are ususally all okay for me;;
I'm usually like that too;;
For real;;
i just need tonn of story, even bad story;;
Some people complain about things that I never realized;;
But ffxv was weak considering it was a ff game;;
Ff is known, imo, for having lots of items that can help battles be easier;;
well ff games changed a lot in combat since ff9;;
Yeah, but ffx, ffxii, ffxiii were good imo;;
They added;;
And etc;;
And it was still challenging;;
well as i said, im very stupid when it comes to analyze what systems are good or interesting;;
they are all okay for me;;
and the lesser interactivity in the game, the better for me;;
thats why Cages games are favourite for me;;
Cages?;;
I think <@207416847019016202> is talking about David Cage <@488734758847905803> .  The guy that made Detroit become human. I have to admit that this game seemed great. I've watched a full game play of it and it was griping. By the way I've watched <@278571432588345345> 's gameplay of Until dawn and what a blast.;;
Man I'm enjoying watching streams more than I actually am gaming.  If I had the adequate internet access I may have tried streaming. My main issue with games is playing alone. I have nostalgia playing games with my buddies back in the day. Mario Kart 64 and diddy kong racing are among the games that represent some of the best moments of my life. I would give everything to travel back to these days and find myself back with my friends sitting in front of those small screens we had back then. Playing split screens up to four players screaming like crazy little fuckers. Ho boy those days .;;
;;
Cheers man;;
And I also miss couch coop, been sooo long;;
Welcome  <@311684705810513921>;;
You re right  <@348165887347523594>, I meant David Cage, and I thought that after 3rd discussion  <@488734758847905803> will remember it üòÇ;;
He did not only Detroit, but several games, And i love them all;;
Welcome <@311684705810513921> ! Thanks for joining us here under the shade of the mango tree, buddy!;;
I appreciate it;;
True <@207416847019016202> , I also played heavy rain, I think that's his game too then;;
<@278571432588345345> and <@348165887347523594> , couch coop.is the best thing in gaming imo;;
I played gauntlet on the PS4 with my wife, brother in law and a friend;;
It is super dope;;
Also playing smash Bros vs;;
<@348165887347523594>  - you definitely should stream when you get better internet;;
for me personally couch co op is sign of that times when i had to play shitty NES games, so i dont love it;;
games for me started when i started playing quests and rpgs;;
and all that plaformer shit before that (and also all the modern platformers and such) are generally not for me, with a little exceptions;;
im very subjective at this, but platformers is not for me, and all of the games in my childhood were kind of platformers;;
Interesting. So you don't like crash Bandicoot?;;
I played SNES games with friends as well and I liked that;;
Nothing like Golden eye 64 with friends. I must of had the better couch co OP experience in my youth;;
well i said NES, not SNES <@488734758847905803>;;
i never played Bandicoot, but i definitely wouldnt like it;;
i liked playing those game at a time;;
"but then when i found about games i like, it was like ""good thats finally we have good games, ill never touch that again""";;
i didnt have much choice back then, russian/chinese copy of NES had limited list of games;;
i had very few co op experiences in life, and i enjoyed them, but for me its not about games;;
its fun play co op with friends because its fun to do many things with friends;;
for me at least;;
I know, <@207416847019016202> , I was just saying where I started haha;;
Yeah, that is true also. Any game could be fun with the right people because those people are interesting, not necessarily the game;;
i played halo 4 (i think) with 3 friends once. it was fun, but i dont remember anything about the game;;
Hm. True. ;;
I played gears of war 1-3 with a friend and it was awesome;;
I remember the game and story pretty well;;
<@272988530278662146> ho  man golden eye 64 was the shit. You're right some of my best couch coop experience too. And also  jet force gemini n64. I remember we use to play Diddy kong racing for money haha. We us to put 10 cents each on the table, the winner would get 30 cents the second 10 cents. So much fun lol;;
GOLDEN EYE WAS THE COD BACK IN THE DAYS AHHHH BEST TIMES LOL;;
Morning chat lol;;
<@488734758847905803> Did gears of wars 1 to 3 with a friend too. Indeed it was awesome for us too.;;
Morning all;;

Hahahahahahaha;;
Unusually lmao;;
<@488734758847905803> No, even this photo won't help üòÇ üòÇ;;
Hahah;;
Quick hi @everyone hoping you are all doing well... it‚Äôs been a while since this bitch of my illness didn‚Äôt attack me with a crisis ... done ‚úÖ I cannot breath correctly coz of the pain I feel in my back / kidney. Result : moral - 200 I feel useless I go in my bed to lay down and rest this fucking body of mine;;
Damn <@502171199850414081> , get some rest and get better quickly!;;
Yes! Hope you feel better soon;;
I'm sorry to hear that you're in a bad way right now;;
Yeah  <@502171199850414081>, please get better;;
I can sympathise <@502171199850414081>, but even pain and discomfort is not exactly the same every day. And that means it can get better, so rest up and kick tomorrow in the ass!;;
also <@488734758847905803> that's a proper Kratos beard dude, are you still in Gramado? You should try rafting!;;
<@488734758847905803> is 999 gyms away from kratos üòÇ üòä;;
I hope you feel better <@502171199850414081> üíó;;
<@502171199850414081> You are strong. You'll endure hell.;;
Good afternoon everyone üòä;;
hi <@486507510635823104>;;
hows your day;;
Stay strong <@502171199850414081> , like <@278571432588345345>  said get as much rest as you need and get ready to kick tomorrow in the dongle till it spits it out.  I‚Äôve had my share of bad times me too. But those days laying in nothing else but pain between life and death, I would keep on saying that shit could always be worst. I‚Äôve been looking at Takedownkd lately (cool and very funny streamer on twitch) who makes us laugh everyday and the boy has only one kidney which he got transplanted not so far ago. I can only imagine the hellish times he went through. Got to keep going my friend. And if means if anything to you, I will pray for you üòâ . God bless you;;
Good afternoon to all, 14:26 h here üòÉ;;
Today I'm in canela, <@278571432588345345> , I'll see if the family wants to go rafting;;
That sounds fun;;
Also, thanks about the beard compliment;;
Yeah <@207416847019016202> and some steroids hahahaha;;
lol;;
Hey <@486507510635823104>;;
What's up?;;
I still think that it looks like the tip of dongle;;
üòÇ;;
My beard <@348165887347523594> ?;;
Hahah;;
Yep, and it seems that it's getting bigger;;
Hahaha just like your dongle here in the discord lmfao;;
lmao!!!;;
so what are you guys playing today?;;
except of <@488734758847905803> , whos playing some kind of Family Trip Simulator, DLC Brasil;;
hahaha;;
<@207416847019016202> I'm about to play Wolfenstein 2. I'm going to focus on this one only. It's been almost a year since I bought it.;;
the same for me <@348165887347523594>;;
i played wolfenstein 1 last year, and i liked it very much;;
and i bought 2nd long ago;;
and really want to play it;;
but didnt get to it yet;;
LMAO <@207416847019016202>;;
"Have you played the DLC ""old blood"", it's well worth it <@207416847019016202>";;
is it DLC for first game?;;
huh;;
Wolfenstein¬Æ: The Old Blood‚Ñ¢ is a standalone prequel to the critically acclaimed first-person action-adventure shooter, Wolfenstein¬Æ: The New Orde;;
interesting;;
i know this name but it never cought my attention, that this is related to series;;
added it to wishlist;;
Good job <@!207416847019016202>, your dongle just grew to 18!;;
thanks bot;;
my dongle is grown up;;
It's pretty good, I played the first game and the standalone DLC back to back;;
its 10 bucks for me now, ill wait for sale;;
<@207416847019016202> I'm so jealous of your dongle, mine is still premature;;
<@207416847019016202> ok, I got mine in the bundle;;

But the torture in the vid was just me getting sprayed in the face with cheap perfume;;
20 views;;
Basically pewdiepie;;
üòÄ;;
"ive just finished Episode 2 of The Council. For now, story is holding up, but game has typical ""telltale"" problems like ""all your different and complicated decisions doesnt matter much""";;
"I don't really like the kind of ""Telltale games"" esc games";;
I've only played Minecraft Story mode season 1;;
<@193534318704852993> Congrats on your dongle;;
well i generally like these kind of games, but actually didnt play any telltale games, only couple of episodes of back to the future and wolf among us;;
<@348165887347523594> you should be dongle supervisor;;
<@486507510635823104> hey, I see your dongle's getting bigger too...nice haha;;
<@207416847019016202> Yeah, I'd take this title lol;;
its not title, but huge responsibilty <@348165887347523594>;;
how huge, youll ask me? sum up all dongles in this discord, thats huge;;
<@498246547838992414> Hello  and good evening üòÉ;;
<@207416847019016202> I think I heard <@488734758847905803> say once with a great dongle comes great responsibilities;;
<@207416847019016202> pretty huge haha;;
"well in more responsible parallel universe our bot levelup message would go something like ""your responsibility just become 7""";;
<@207416847019016202> I like dongle better üòÇ;;
Oi <@348165887347523594>;;
Y'know what?;;
I'm home alone tomorrow, I'm gonna do a cover of alphabet aerobics;;
Or whatever it's called;;
I'm not sure what it is, let me google that;;
It's the one of the only rap songs I like;;
Ho, yeah pretty good idea;;
"It's the proper name ""alphabet aerobics""";;
And since my throat is killing me, my cover of a powerwolf song won't come out good;;
Ah, so I got it right, *yeet*;;
I think so;;
Grammar and stuff I'm not the best at lmao;;
Same thing here lol...I was going to say it doesn't sound like an easy thing to do;;
I can do it;;
I think;;
I've sang on stage before;;
School plays are the worst, man;;
Really? haha, me too, I would not be able to do it again though. I use to sing;;
<@498246547838992414> Agreed;;
<@498246547838992414> Once I forgot my words;;
Awful moment;;
It was a few years ago, and I'm not the best singer, but I was the only one in class with a voice deep enough at the time lmao;;
<@348165887347523594> oh god, that suuuucks;;
haha;;
<@498246547838992414> Yeah sucks balls lol;;
Horrible;;
"<@348165887347523594> I'd guess so, being up on stage, then being like ""eeerrrrmmm""";;
Not only in front of my high school but in front of at least 3 high schools;;
Ooooof;;
That's even worse;;
I don't know how I survive the shame hahaha;;
I'd fall over and hope I broke something;;
If this had happened to me now, just put me in a mental institute right away;;
Lmao;;
hahaa;;
I would've sank in a deep depression right then;;
Yeah, I'd just explode;;
Or just run as fast as humanly possible;;
<@498246547838992414> üòÇ üòÇ  So true hahahaha;;
Naruto run out of the country;;
Start a new life as a pagan;;
hahahaha;;
dude, I swear;;
I'm glad I never forgot the words to that song, jesus;;
haha, lucky you;;
"But they just chose me because I had ""the perfect voice"" and ""a good understanding of the English language""";;
Good think my co-singer picked up quickly;;
<@498246547838992414> I see;;
Saved your life right there;;
Yeah, i'll for ever be grateful üòÖ;;
I'd be too;;
They still made fun of me though, good thing it was my last year;;
Went to college in the U.S;;
Could you imagine if it was your first?;;
God damn, no I can't haha;;
You'd be scarred for life;;
I think that I'd ask my parents to get me away, at least 3 towns away;;
Move to another state;;
Exactly üòÖ;;
Hell, move to the moon;;
üòÇ;;
It's not the kind of thing you ever forget;;
You know the memories you get and be like, sshhhh, face palm;;
Yeah, I still have traumas from elementary school;;
Good job <@!498246547838992414>, your dongle just grew to 7!;;
Yeetus;;
<@498246547838992414> I see exactly what you mean;;
But, I had a school dance that we'd do every year, and it was in the summer, It was unpleasantly hot, and we gad to do this dance, and I was really chubby in elementary school, so we had to wear these shorts and they were a bit tight on me, and so while we were dancing I couldn't move my legs properly and so, I fell face first on the grass;;
LMAO!!!!!! üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ  hoooooo loooord;;
My god what a lonely moment;;
It didn't help that I bounced a little;;
hahahaha;;
I wanted the sweet release of death that moment;;
üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ  death seems so sweet right there right;;
Exactly;;
I have lot of them awful stories;;
ho me to, I have plenty of them;;
That my elementary school friends, still mention;;
One of my teacher had a what you call it tear gaz thingy in his bag. My buddy classmate convince my dumb naive ass to go check it out and  press it. It went straight to my face. I was 6 or 7 back then. No need to tell how much it burned me. I couldn't see, my face felt like my skin was falling off. And my teacher beat the hell out of me, then, told my parents and my father whipped my ass;;
Oh my god;;
That's awful;;
Yeah, another one of this face palm memories üòÖ;;
I remember one of my most painful ones;;
It was the annual school bike trip and I HATED cycling to death, and so during the trip we came across a thin bridge and we stopped on it and when we stopped, my bike slipped and I fell off the bridge, a half meter fall, straight into nettles;;
Some people still laugh when they see me;;
Ho shit. ho no. The pain plus the shame. I feel bad for your younger you haha;;
Yeah, I got past the horrible younger me though;;
Still as awkward irl tho;;
Good to hear üòÖ;;
Not as bad, but still;;
Well we both are. I still make shameful mistakes sometimes haha. I'm king of the face palm moments in my books;;
On my yt channel I uploaded an old vid I had on my phone, there you can see the horribleness that was my face;;
I'll send you the link;;
Yeah please do haha;;
Did it;;
Whoa you guys talking about singing?;;
I had a band;;
I was the bassist and singer;;
But I suck at singing haha;;
Morning everyone!;;
I went to sleep at 1.30 am today, which is really early for me;;
<@488734758847905803> Yeah, some time ago though, It sucked;;
Also, good morning @everyone;;
morning <@498246547838992414>;;
morning <@498246547838992414> and everyone.;;
morning <@300033838065778702>;;
how are you guys;;
hey <@207416847019016202>;;
i am on a 3 day sick leave.;;
but my internet is fixed so i got that going for me which is nice;;
are you gonna be paid for sick days <@300033838065778702>  ?;;
yes <@207416847019016202> i am allowed a max of 18 days sick leave per year;;
wow;;
so you dont need to show your employer some kind of verification from doctor?;;
not unless i go on 7 consecutive days;;
and when you need to notify your employer?;;
like on fact?;;
today i will not be on work?;;
yeah i just text my colleague and tell them i am still feeling unwell;;
its really strange for me that law allows it;;
in russia we can have unlimited sick days i think;;
but with doctor verification;;
of course i personally can say to my employer that today i will not be at work, but its privelege of certain work, its not in the law;;
yeah.. but i think it kinda is convenient. i dont really want to wait long hours at the clinic and get a sick certificate and some paracetamols;;
i think it's common practice here in the UK. self certified sick leave;;
"well i think its very unconvinient for employer, that anyone can say ""today i wont be at work""";;
basically, you can skip work without consequences 18 times a year;;
for me its like... fucking exploit;;
that is true but that is where trust between employee and employer comes in hand. i mean, i am not taking them for granted. i have been having tonsilitis over the weekend and i am still not feeling well;;
i agree about trust;;
but if youre employer, you can say when employee is trying to fuck with you, and in russia you would be fired for that, no matter what law allows you;;
well yeah. but in my case i have a good reputation with my employers. they know when i am really unwell and usually they'd be the ones to advise me to take a few days rest rather than coughing non stop and infect the others üòÑ;;
well in my case i never even explain reason why im away;;
even for several days;;
but it depends on employer;;
isnt that worse, like not even explaining why you dont show up to work even for several days?;;
well, im in IT, and what my employer wants from me, is job getting done in time and in good quality, and not some explanations why im not in the office;;
"of course, if i have huge important tasks, and just say ""i will not do them because fuck off"", it will be a problem";;
but as soon as i have no important tasks, or a will do them from home dont matter when, maybe at night), thats no problem;;
well that makes sense.;;
Good job <@!300033838065778702>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
what kind of job do you have <@300033838065778702>  ?;;
diplomatic services;;
Like in embassy or something?;;
yes. i work for my country's embassy here in the UK;;
and your county is?;;
Brunei;;
all i know about Brunei is some russian song called Sultan of Brunei üòÄ;;
that is something at least. i have never heard of it but i hope it is something positive about him üòÑ;;
"i dont remember, but i think it was something like ""he doesnt care about anything because his life is perfect"" üòÄ";;
well that's what happens when people talk about someone they dont know.;;
probably best if we not talk about this subject üòÑ;;
haha;;
welli personally dont give a fuck about politics;;
games and football news bother me much more;;
football sounds like a good thing to talk about üòÑ;;
yeah;;
i dont watch it much last weeks, but still know main news and results;;
you live in London?;;
any particular team you follow/support?;;
yea i live in London. been here for the past 5 years;;
root for some local team?;;
Chelsea, totetham, arsenal , fulham?;;
oh no. im a United fan. üòÑ;;
but it try to watch as much as i can.;;
haha;;
my brother MU fan;;
and im more concerned for Liverpool, but i wouldnt say im fan, cause im fan of Moscow team;;
and my brother too;;
Spartak or Lokomotiv?;;
haha;;
there are 4 moscow teams;;
but you got mine right;;
Spartak;;
also CSKA and Dinamo;;
oh right. but the two i think are the bigger ones üòÑ;;
Actually most popular two are Spartan and cska;;
Because Spartan was huge in 90s, and cska in 00s;;
ahh i see. i sometimes hear then in the Champions League so i am a bit familiar with the names. for a while the team Anzhi was huge because of them buying big name players;;
Loki is cureent champion, but no one gives a fuck about them;;
Loko;;
LUL;;
Also Zenit is very popular;;
oh yes Zenit too;;
But it's not moscow;;
yeah it's St Petersburg.;;
Morning mango-rooskies;;
How are you all doing?;;
Still dying <@488734758847905803>;;
Damn <@498246547838992414> , really?;;
<@488734758847905803> Yeah, it's still not getting better, I think I should take off untill next week or at least tomorrow;;
Been coughing up my organs for a week now;;
i spent all november coughing my organs out, but now its fine <@498246547838992414>;;
Fuck dude;;

Hey <@207416847019016202>;;
<@207416847019016202> Glad it got better;;
<@498246547838992414> , do you think it's time to visit the hospital maybe?;;
But yeah, sometimes it's hard to breathe;;
for me it was some times hard to breath when i cough;;
<@488734758847905803> Yeah, I think I'm gonna take time off school until the weekend;;
it turned out a usual bronchytus;;
<@207416847019016202> That's what I have, the doctor said, only a bad case of it;;
hm;;
he prescribed me some anticough medecine and some antibiotics;;
Same here;;
He said the back of my mouth/throat was all completely red;;
i cointinued to cough all december, but now its okay;;
it was only like 3-4 short coughs in a day, but it felt terrible;;
Shit that sucks;;
Coughing in general sucks;;
Morning  <@488734758847905803>!;;
I have asthma , not bronchitis, so I know how much it sucks to not breathe right;;
Hey <@455797717763883009> !;;
How are you dude?;;
Also, what kind of treatment do you like to use <@498246547838992414> ?;;
I'm more of a natural guy myself;;
I use like lavender and eucalyptus oil on my chest;;
Doing good buddy. Was getting my residence permit renewed the past couple days.;;
<@488734758847905803> I think I have a really slight case of asthma, but I've not been properly diagnosed, It's just after I've done exercise, I have trouble breathing, but it's not like I feel like I'm dying, like I am rn;;
morning <@455797717763883009>;;
Ouch, that sucks <@455797717763883009> , did you finish getting it then?;;
Ayyooo <@455797717763883009>;;
Ah, sports asthma <@498246547838992414>;;
Yo  <@498246547838992414> <@207416847019016202>;;
<@488734758847905803> I dislike sports and exercise in general;;
Meesa lazy;;
do you plan rub some oil on the chest during streams <@488734758847905803> ?;;
Well step 1 is done  <@488734758847905803> now I need to wait until June to go get my biometrics rechecked again. All fine apart from that;;

Hahahahahahaha oil on the dongle was great <@498246547838992414>;;

Your off vacation? <@488734758847905803>;;
Or you just stay up partying too late;;
just finished a 6 hr stream and 6 followers away from hitting the big 300 üòÉ;;
<@488734758847905803> of course I will;;
Actually after each episode I share current opinion;;
Now I'm on 3rd, and though story is interesting, I can already feel how all systems in the game (and there are systems) dont matter;;
Congrats  <@481328139876827138>;;
Morning/afternoon /evening everyone;;
morning <@300033838065778702>;;
how are you today;;
Good morning afternoon, evening to all of you my loves üòç;;
Morning üî•üî•;;
Good job <@!345984543246909442>, your dongle just grew to 8!;;
morning <@348165887347523594>;;
morning <@345984543246909442>;;
How you guys are doing;;
I see <@348165887347523594> woke up happy lol;;
im about to go to lunch!;;
I‚Äôm still at work lol;;
Ho my God that dongle is blocking my view  <@345984543246909442>;;
Enjoy your meal  <@207416847019016202>;;
Didn't sleep yet though;;
you didnt sleep yet <@348165887347523594> ?;;
what did you do then?;;
Nope listening to some paranormal talk shows. Old Art Bell archives. Relaxing;;
thats good too;;
Yeah, I ve always been into paranormal and mysterious stuff;;
I avoid the episodes when he has conspiracy theories freaks on. I'm no fan of conspiracy theories;;
They tend to see evil everywhere.  And most of the time they're the worst racist bigoted people around.;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 11!;;
Not that I don't believe in conspiracies at all, but the drama has gone too far. The stuff I've heard people like Alex Jones say is plain dangerous and hateful.;;
Not that I believe in conspiracies, but <@348165887347523594> 's dongle just keep on growing;;
The earth is a triangle made of rubber;;
Noooo <@498246547838992414> the earth is made out of plastic & fake news üòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
Australia doesn't exist;;
Nor does Canada;;
<@207416847019016202> Lmao!!! It's unnatural;;
I thought the world was a swiss cheese;;
world is a hole in a swiss cheese;;
Hahaha;;
World is flat;;
Heeeeelll yeah üòÇ üòÇ;;
theres actually many people who believes it;;
I am on vacation still <@287320205020102667> , just been walking a lot every day so I've been physically tired lmao;;
walking is good <@488734758847905803>;;
Wooooooo congrats <@481328139876827138>;;
That's dope af;;
Really <@207416847019016202> ? Like the decisions you make don't matter?;;
Hey <@300033838065778702> ! What up?;;
Hey <@348165887347523594> , what's up ? How was the Korean food last night?;;
<@345984543246909442> , better get some bigger pants, your dongle is showing;;
name me one adventure-like game besides detroit, where your decisions really matter lol <@488734758847905803>;;
Heavy rain <@207416847019016202>;;
The Witcher 3;;
besides Cages games;;
witcher is RPG;;
i mean just story based non fighting games;;
quests or telltale like;;
Then none really;;
Not that I know of at least;;
<@488734758847905803> pretty damn good. I think this is what I'm gonna have for breakfast Haha;;
Lmao nice!;;
By adventure  <@207416847019016202>, do you not consider a game like ME adventure?;;
Mass Effect is RPG <@348165887347523594>;;
Me?;;
Ah ok;;
i mean quests of all kinds;;
Because adventure is quite broad;;
Me dumb with abbreviations sometimes lol;;
<@488734758847905803> I'm too;;
Most adventure games are RPGs nowadays;;
Even tomb raider;;
<@488734758847905803> Agreed;;
well of course;;
but im talking about fucking adventures and quests;;
Dreamfall, monkey island;;
It is hard to classify games nowadays anyway;;
al cage games is adventures;;
not action;;
not rpg;;
<@207416847019016202> I understand;;
its not so hard, many games has one main genre;;
FPS, RPG, RTS, quest;;
i dont know if quest genre exists in english language;;
I haven't heard of a quest genre personally;;
Well Mass Effect is Action Rpg.  To me any game that has action is adventure;;
action RPG allright;;
but its not quest;;
I agree <@348165887347523594> ;;
;;
Horizon zero Dawn is an adventure game to me as well, adventure rpg;;
and im talking about quests, adventures and interactive movies;;
Oh;;
Maybe quantum break <@207416847019016202> ?;;
I haven't played it;;
But it seems like it could be what you're talking about;;
all that games without actual gameplay, besides talking and item using;;
Walking simulator;;
Hm. Oh. Oxenfree;;
<@488734758847905803> i loved quantum break, but its more action/interactive movie;;
Oh I see;;
Like telltale games? Or until dawn ?;;
Oxenfree changes a lot depending on your choices;;
"walking simulator is too far into ""doing nothing""";;
And there's no gameplay;;
Oh yeah <@348165887347523594> , until dawn;;
Yep;;
So, until dawn and oxenfree are two games where you just walk and use items;;
Minecraft Story Mode should've been game of the year;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah;;
And choices are relevant to ending / progression;;
Lmao <@498246547838992414>;;
Lmso;;
Gonna go get ready for the day. Brb;;
Y no Roblox story mode??;;
im a little consfused. Didnt anyone here played classic quests/adventures? Monkey Island, The Longest Journey, Siberia, Broken Sword? Why everyne starts mention RPG adventures?;;
"i say quest/adventure, and everyone like ""mass effect, witcher"". WTF";;
<@207416847019016202> No brother.  You need to stream all of this;;
i will maybe, since theres many text;;
Aaaaalll of it;;
haha;;
Hihihi;;
<@348165887347523594> by the way, if youre interested, im almost certainly will be streaming at saturday, like from 3 am YOUR time, so its night from friday to saturday;;
Do a 48 hours stream;;
i can stream black screen for 48 hours <@498246547838992414>;;
<@207416847019016202>  I'll be present;;
<@207416847019016202> pure quality;;
<@207416847019016202>hahaha;;
4k black screen <@498246547838992414>;;
fuck, i cant do 4k black screen.... <@348165887347523594> wont be able to watch;;
<@207416847019016202> *i need it, now*;;
I'll buy a new 4k screen exclusively for that don't worry;;
well your internet will still be shit <@348165887347523594>;;
True singularity;;
I will buy a 69k dongle screen;;
little preview for you <@498246547838992414>;;
<@207416847019016202> üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;
Daaaang;;
Brb;;
Flexin';;
and that white shadow at the right upper corner - its a twist in a story;;
My god;;
Such a compelling storyline;;
I'm on the edge of my seat;;
I fell off;;
Dang;;
üòÄ  <@498246547838992414>;;
I literally fell down;;
t r i g g e r e d;;
and about choices in the council - i will say you this <@488734758847905803> ;;
without spoiling anything;;
game gives you what seems like a big decisions, but so far i didnt see any real impact on story from this decisions. i will say more, they DIDNT matter so far at all.;;
it may be, that in the 5th episode they will show that your previous choices mattered - exactly like they did in Detroit, choice mattered more in the end there.;;
But, given that ive heard pretty string opinion, that council ending is a fail, so i think man who said it, meant exactly that all your choices and different skills didnt matter.;;
also, i strongly believe that episodic nature kills some games;;
you know, like game or movie can be very good at start and bad at the end;;
but these whole games and movies scripts usually done in one take;;
and episodic games are often obviously starts with scripts for 1-2 episodes;;
exactly like in TV shows;;
we started, and then we will end this story;;
"so you can see often, that 1st episode was ""WOW WHAT A STORY"", and by the 5th episode it all felt like big screwup";;
it can be because of that every episode is kind of has its own begining and ending;;
"i can't describe it clearly now, but for example, one famous ""telltale-like"" games has this episode, 3 i think, which stared with HUGE changes, it was fantastic, but by the start of 4th episode they was like ""well lets send characters in time and pretend that story of 3rd episode never happened""";;
i mean that sometimes episodes is way too separated in story;;
even if its like one story through all episodes;;
You just made my dongle go through all kinds of states. Up. straighten, flat, back up, left and right. I'm captivated;;
After reading this. I realize that I don't really know of any games where choices did actually matter to this extent.;;
there a very FEW games where choices matter <@348165887347523594>;;
heavy rain, ME2, detroit - i think thats almost all haha;;
True lol . What do you think of Nier automata.  It's action rpg but it has an amazing amount of endings;;
i didnt played it yet;;
well;;
nots that;;
i started it;;
26 different endings. I have only done 2 of them;;
saw unskippable intro, then did some running and fighting, then encountered boss, then died, and game suddenly started from very beginning;;
i didnt understand if it was a bug or okay;;
Not s big;;
Not a bug;;
It s hard to get to the beginning of the game. The first check point;;
well then ill not be playing it, no matter how story is good. i HATE this idea of starting again;;
Once you beat the first board, you'll be able to save;;
and also i heard that when you finish, you should play again and theres different story. i wouldnt do it either, i hate repeat anything in games;;
The game is  very different each time;;
Totally different;;
Like 25 sequels in one game;;
Doesn't feel like repeating. Me too I never ever replay a game.;;
Doesn't matter the replayability;;
well thanks ive had enough when game decided to start from the beginning;;
üòÇ üòÇ;;
Yeah they did that with the other nier game;;
You had to beat the  game 5 times I think to get the true ending;;
Like wtf;;
Talking about it made me want to do the third act;;
I barely have time to play new games;;
You want me to replay the same game?;;
24 times  <@488734758847905803>;;
No, I mean the old nier game;;
The PS2 or ps3 one;;
Ho ok ok;;
Automata is insane;;
I would never lol;;
24 times is just ridiculous;;
YouTube that dongle;;
And watch some other dude beat it;;
I would if there was only one game made in the entire world every year;;
Yeah exactly;;
I haven't even play new game + in horizon zero Dawn;;
And I love that game;;
A lot;;
As <@207416847019016202> knows;;
yeah;;
I never do +new games. Usually, I pass to another game and forget the gameplay.;;
Even God of war I couldn't;;
well you know, it depends on player type. some guys like repeating. for example, when in MMO you play the same quest 20 times.;;
And even if i play MMO, i still play every quest one time;;
I'm done with grinding games. Can't do anymore;;
well i never grinded games;;
I've done like 1 month of warframe ...and was ok for the time, and never ever tried another one.;;
"thats why i never played games like CS and such. i want to feel any progress - in story, in locations, i character abilities. And not just ""new match, new match, another match""";;
Grind games like world of Warcraft I won't ever do again;;
But persona and final fantasy (old final fantasy) are grind games imo;;
But those are worth it;;
<@488734758847905803> same thing here;;
True that <@348165887347523594>;;
Because at least you grind for a story;;
Exactly <@488734758847905803>;;
Anthem will be for me a turning point on what I think on any kind of mmo games that will ever come out again. I already am not into them, but I want to see if it will prove my point that it's trash, or not. We'll see;;
about grind, one thing if you need to kill 100 beasts to level up, it can be okay for me.;;
but when you need to repeat some quest... thats not for me <@488734758847905803>;;
<@207416847019016202> yeah, I think that's what he is saying;;
especially quest with story and dialogues;;
why would i want to repeat it?;;
Lots of people seem to like it. I don't <@207416847019016202>;;
Same about anthem <@348165887347523594>;;
Except I'll see others play hahaha;;
True that <@207416847019016202>;;
lmao <@488734758847905803>;;
I have an origin premier access account, so I will try it;;
I want it so bad to change my mind;;
Oh nice;;
Origin oremier is for PC right?;;
Premier*;;
yeah;;
It's well worth it;;
My PC sucks for gaming unfortunately;;
Lots of games included, and all the new ones with early access;;
Yeah I remember you said so;;
as i said early, i play sometimes two story-filled MMOs, elder scrolls online, and Start wars.;;
and star wars MMO has this fantastic group dialogue system, when NPC says somethin, and only one of you can answer.;;
"but when i played with someone, it was always like ""dude, why are you not skipping this cutscene? we all played this quest 10 times""";;
and i woudnt repeat any quest even one time, dont matter how good quest story was;;
Hm. Elder scrolls online could be for me;;
There were games that I played more than once in the past;;
I would, but i'd need to find the right friends to play it;;
Vandal hearts, Zelda ocarina of Time, Majora's mask, windwaker;;
But those games are mostly because of the nostalgia;;
haha i dont have any friends to play co op or online, so i play alone often, and like it;;
I did play games multiples times in the past, just la ME2, I just can't anymore;;
and replay games VERY rarely;;
like one game in 10 years;;
Yeah it's tough;;
I'll be replaying ffx soon;;
Love that soundtrack;;
<@207416847019016202> pretty much the same here;;
And the game story;;
Sometimes I also replay FF games to better understand the story tbh;;
Haha;;
Well, I used to I should say;;
well FF games i play sometimes, and will replay them, its not boring for me;;
I have replayed metro redux bundle last month though. But that is because it was a long time ago  the redux wasn't just a remastered;;
but for now actually i have FF 8,9,10, started over (second playthrough) and not finished;;
Ah true <@348165887347523594>;;
Yeah <@207416847019016202> I do that sometimes too;;
I have never played ff8;;
I'm planning on replaying super mario 64 too, but that is because it reminds me the best part of my life;;
I was too old when I first played ff7;;
I had never heard of ff games until I was like 13;;
Oh fo sho;;
That's one of the reasons I replay ocarina of time;;
I totally hear you <@488734758847905803>  üòÉ;;
Brings you back in those days ha;;
Yeah it does;;
When I'll finally get a decent connection. I hope we could try some cool games together boys;;
Yeah that would be awesome!;;
In May I might get a decent pc;;
But I have Xbox and PS4 now;;
I used to only have a PS4;;
I've have both too;;
Oh that's awesome!;;
I don't play my xbox one much;;
I love gamepass haha shit is amazing;;
Add me when you can;;
Xbox is purplemango gaming;;
Yeah, I hear you. I 'm thinking about getting the game pass. But it's complicated as I can't just buy it online like my xbox live gold card;;
And PS4 is acidowl7;;
ok, will add you , noted;;
You can't?;;
Well looks like for the game pass, I need to use my credit card. And my xbox live account is still U.S.;;
I can't use my french credit card;;
So you need a credit card then?;;
That sucks.;;
as for the xbox live account, I just buy it online on a third party site;;
I thought you could buy like a prepaid card;;
You're sure?;;
I didn't see any game pass subscription codes available;;
I can change my account to french, but it's a one time operation. I'm reluctant. I don't plan on staying here for much longer;;
I'm not sure. But I thought so;;
Maybe I can get a gift card and refill my account though. I never thought about that;;
I'll google this;;
I'll check if it is possible to add credit on my account, then use it to pay the game pass with it;;
Then wait for it;;
Yeah;;
Ah yeah I think you can do that;;
Guys, please I need emotional support;;
what's up <@498246547838992414> ?;;
Hey dude, what do you need <@498246547838992414> ?;;
Me and my gf, just split up;;
ho fuck;;
Oh damn dude I'm really sorry;;
God damn I'm so sorry man.;;
That can really suck, I know;;
Do you want to talk about what happened?;;
<@488734758847905803> It wasn't an argument or so, she just didn't feel the same about me as I did for her;;
shit;;
I just went through this;;
Are you sure?;;
Maybe, I just felt it more, because at the time, she was the reason I didn't give up;;
The advice I could give you is, don't push it. Let her go;;
We're still friends, but it packs a punch, you know;;
Good job <@!498246547838992414>, your dongle just grew to 8!;;
<@159985870458322944> Bad timing;;
shit mee6 bad call hahahaha;;
Shut up mee6 you dick;;
<@348165887347523594> but thanks, I'll try to get over her;;
üòÇ üòÇ;;
<@498246547838992414> not laughing about you;;
just the mee6;;
<@348165887347523594> Nono, I got it;;
<@498246547838992414> I've been through bad breakups, I think everyone has. It always feels like the pain is never going to go away and such;;
But it does, I promise;;
I actually heard a very touching story a few months ago;;
<@488734758847905803> I'll keep that in mind;;
It does <@498246547838992414>;;
I'll be back in a few minutes <@498246547838992414>;;
Yeah <@498246547838992414> , one thing that helped me get through my last breakup 7 years ago was that it was an experience and all experiences come and go;;
<@348165887347523594> Okay, seeya;;
Like that saying we have here in Brazil;;
There's no evil that doesn't end nor good that lasts forever;;
<@488734758847905803> Wow, I never heard that before, but it does make sense;;
Yeah I like that saying;;
Me too;;
Don't hesitate to let it go if you have to alone in you room, you bathroom. And don't take me wrong, but crying helps <@498246547838992414>;;
<@348165887347523594> I can't really cry;;
Haven't cried in 5 years;;
Even at times when I felt like it was coming, it didn't;;
I'm not here to know the details, so I don't know what happened  nor will I try to give or not give you any hopes regarding the outcome of this relation. But try to focus on yourself and the good things you can do alone.;;
<@498246547838992414> I understand.;;
<@348165887347523594> thanks, my friends and twitch, youtube, etc have really helped me in the past, I'm sure it will help again;;
<@498246547838992414> Exactly, it helped me a lot, and it does help me still. I went through a very bad, almost horrible break up like 8 months ago. Today, I can swear to you that I'm much happier without this person in my life.;;
You'll see what I mean in the near future;;
<@348165887347523594> My (now ex) will always be a good friend, we were best friends before being together, and I still do love her, in that way, she doesn't, and I respect that, I wasn't angry or so, but I was heartbroken, but I'm sure I'll get over it;;
<@498246547838992414> Good to hear my friend, good to hear üòâ;;
Thanks @<@348165887347523594> and @<@488734758847905803>  for the help;;
I appreciate it;;
It's only normal my man <@498246547838992414> , right here if you need to talk;;
or dm lol;;
Thanks!!;;
Lmao;;
üòÇ;;
Of course;;
I'm the same with crying though;;
It sucks;;
I sometimes really want to cry;;
Because I know how much you let go when you dk;;
Do*;;
It does help;;
"My wife calls it ""spiritual vomiting""";;
haha, it's a good way to put it;;
And when I actually do manage to cry;;
I feel so much better;;
<@488734758847905803> I have this weird feeling in my chest;;
<@488734758847905803> true;;
Am I gonna explode?;;
Also <@498246547838992414> you are very mature to stay friends with her;;
I learned to cry. Actually I did learn from youtube;;
I am not friends with any of my ex's;;
Really <@348165887347523594> ?;;
<@488734758847905803> of course, I still like her, and she still likes me, only not in that way;;
<@488734758847905803> I have never been able to stay friend with any of my ex either.;;
<@488734758847905803> Yes, I needed help I searched all over the internet;;
"We're both not really ""emotional"" people, so it was hard for her to tell me how she felt, I tried to be as understanding as I could, because I didn't want her out of my life completely";;
<@498246547838992414> I see, well, I don't recommend you to stay too close to her, at least not right now.;;
<@348165887347523594> I won't, I'll give her time;;
I need some as well;;
Wow <@348165887347523594> , j would have never thought about looking for help with crying. Could you send me the video of you remember?;;
Yeah <@498246547838992414> , I'd definitely say you need it more than she does at this point specifically;;
No give you time, don't worry about her <@498246547838992414>;;
Agreed kelly;;
<@488734758847905803> I was going to say I agree with you;;
Haha;;
üòÖ;;
guys, speaking of unimportant things such as games, given that some of you love games with story... any favourite FPS story games?;;
like CoD, or Wolfenstein;;
i know that <@348165887347523594> likes Wolfenstein;;
Does Borderlands count?;;
Let me think a minute about that;;
maybe, but i dont played it <@498246547838992414>;;
is it FPS?;;
Yeah;;
then yes;;
Lol;;
its hist i hated FPS before it became story based;;
i mean not just story, but all these tonns of cutscenes and dialogues;;
Well my favorite one would be the Halo saga  like all of them but the last one  <@207416847019016202>;;
I like a good story, but gameplay is more important to me;;
haha its totally different for me;;
the less gameplay the better;;
i didnt played halo <@348165887347523594>;;
my favourite FPS with story i think CoD;;
ive played all of them since Modern Warfare I;;
actually i started just in 2016, and played all during summer;;
Never played halo either, I was always a ps4 scrub;;
and my most favourite was Infinite Warfare, which was i think the most hated in community;;
<@207416847019016202> Cod's has good story lines I agree. But Halo is more grandiose and much bigger in term of a whole world;;
what makes CoD the best for me, its you are never alone. theres always some companions near;;
And Halo has books and comics and amines and movies and a lots of medium to delve into its world;;
<@207416847019016202> Yeah, I like that too;;
<@207416847019016202> Same thing with Halo, you're never alone;;
thats why i hated Doom 3;;
if any of you played;;
you started out with some companions, but theres no action, just walking and talking;;
and then you got separated, and then SHIT happens;;
"and then, during ALL the games, some dudes on the radio are like ""lets meet"", and you trying to meet them, and they got killed";;
and to the end of the game you didnt encounter any alive NPC;;
a hated that;;
because i love story interaction;;
"and in CoD its always like ""lets go lets go!""";;
I don't play horror games by my self, like never. But I love it when I have a buddy with me. Which means that I haven't played an horror game for a while. Last one was Alien isolation(which was awsome);;
well i think i dont play them at all;;
i started isolation, but then i realised that theres no action and you need to hide and such, and i think thats not for me;;
by the way, i loved Bioshock infinite;;
I loved all Bioshocks. My fav is infinite;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 12!;;
Damn soon my dongle will pack more meat that my entire body;;
shame for me, i played infinite and didnt played first two;;
usually i never do these things;;
always start from the first one;;
You should, it won't feel old, especially the second one. The first one has an incredible story;;
i started bioshock 1;;
didnt get me yet;;
theres no much story like in infinite;;
Give it a fear try, it will get to you...Infinite's story is weak compare to the first one;;
Same here <@348165887347523594> I tried playing resident evil 2 as a kid by myself and just never could get far haha but with a friend it was always fine;;
<@488734758847905803> Sorry I missed that reply where you asked if I can remember the video. I don't unfortunately. But I remember viewing multiple videos actually;;
Fps games with stories - Halo and borderlands;;
<@488734758847905803> haha;;
Halo is awesome;;
No problem <@348165887347523594>;;
Yeah I agree give Halo a try and also BioShock;;
It gets good;;
Yeah you should <@207416847019016202>;;
well, halo is only xbox?;;
Isn't it available on pc?;;
i dont know;;
you tell me;;
maybe;;
I think it is. At least the first one is. And it's well worth it;;
It was first made for pc;;
hm;;
theres no halo on steam <@348165887347523594>;;
Not on steam, but It must be somewhere out there;;
well is not on steam then where?;;
win10 games store maybe;;
I'm googling it;;
I found this https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Combat-Evolved-PC/dp/B00009TW6R;;
But there must be a digital version somewhere;;
haha what is it?;;
disk?;;
yep;;
i cant describe how i dont see point in playng games on disks in our time;;
i dont have rom maybe for 10 years;;
hahahaha...I just wanted to  point that it does exist. If it exists on cd, I'm sure you can find it for download;;
well ill check torrents;;
Yep, didn't want to say it out loud üòÖ;;
i has no shame about it lol;;
i play licinsed games because steam is very convinient and has regional prices;;
Don't ever say that on Karak's platform üòÇ;;
but if i cant get the game or game is only russian - fuck it, ill pirate it;;
lmao;;
dude, if I can't find something, I do what I got to do;;
also i listen licinsed music, just because its fucking VERY cheap with streaming services;;
but movies... i really dont know when you can get movie legally;;
and not on fucking disk;;
Yeah, Karak s discord will get pissed af if you say you're pirating games lol;;
and im not even started on software prices;;
Yeah same;;
well i dont give a fuck about whos pissed;;
I know what you mean;;
Lmao;;
I was new that that discord thing and said things I shouldn't on Karak's discord. I don't even go there much any more üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;
I've learned lol;;
They prob don't remember anymore <@348165887347523594>;;
haha;;
I can't imagine you said something too bad lol;;
I don't know, I feel stupid when I go there;;
Good morning mangos;;
Hey <@287320205020102667>;;
I know what you mean <@348165887347523594>  it feels like everyone there knows more about games than you do right?;;
I'm just like damn;;
I don't know shit about what's going on;;
These people know developers' names and shit haha;;
<@488734758847905803> Yeah, I feel like I was raised in a tree house;;
Lmfao hahahahaha;;
maybe <@348165887347523594> said that he uses client servers to download something;;
üòÇ;;
hi <@287320205020102667>;;
<@207416847019016202> exactly;;
How‚Äôs everyone this morning;;
The thing is that I didn't get the time to say that my clients and I are downloading from the server;;
"well i think karaks responce was just like ""in case if your client here, dont mention it""";;
<@207416847019016202> No;;
<@207416847019016202> He said that people in the discord would react badly;;
well then i read it two times and still didnt get lol;;
I have no clue what's going on;;
He stopped me when I said that I was secretly downloading from my client server, The thing is that my clients and I are doing it secretly so there employees don't try to do the same. He thought that I was downloading without there consent <@207416847019016202>;;
well i thouht that too;;
haha;;
maybe you wasnt clear enough;;
I couldn't be any clearer since I didn't get the time to finish. It was stupid of me anyway. That is what happens when you have to rethink all the time what you're saying in a language you don't use on a daily basis;;
You say stupid things and when it's written, well it's done;;
haha yeah;;
i sound in russian way more smarter;;
<@207416847019016202> I know exactly what you're saying.;;
I wanna go back to sleep üò¶;;
I might <@287320205020102667>;;
Lucky you lol I can‚Äôt;;
üòÖ;;
<@207416847019016202> but, really that's not really why I'm not going there much anymore, It's more about me not knowing as much  as anyone in there lol.;;
haha;;
and im just want a bit smaller community;;
and i created it here haha <@488734758847905803>;;
jk;;
They are very technical . I can't fallow. Here is more suited for a simple dude like me .;;
hey <@488734758847905803> and everyone. i just read some of the texts. getting back to work with a sore throat and a slipped disc RIP;;
Who is very technical? <@348165887347523594>;;
Hiya <@300033838065778702>;;
hey <@287320205020102667> hows it going?;;
So far not too bad. We shall how today pans out lol hbu;;
Good job <@!287320205020102667>, your dongle just grew to 9!;;
yeah apart from having a sore throat and back pain, i cant complain. already looking forward to leave the office though LOL;;
<@287320205020102667> , Kelly meant the people in another discord, the ACG discord;;
Damn <@300033838065778702> , hope your back gets better soon;;
Your throat too;;
Lmao <@207416847019016202> haha;;
Well, the idea is to continue to expand the discord with great people and streamers.;;
well you know, theres always some limit <@488734758847905803>;;
i dont think that you want 10000000 people here for example;;
True haha;;
Of course;;
yeah. going for chiropractor treatment tomorrow to try get it sorted out;;
Good job <@!300033838065778702>, your dongle just grew to 5!;;
I think after a while to join the discord people will have to be subscribers or patrons;;
But people who are already in here will continue to have access for free;;
Nice <@300033838065778702> I need that myself, I have a crooked spine but it's hard to get that sorted;;
Hope your insurance covers that;;
Mine doesn't haha;;
thank god for goupon. i found a package for initial consultation, treatment and 2 follow up sessions for ¬£24, which would usually cost ¬£120.;;
our medical only covers the normal bits. none of the 'extraordinary' stuff;;
Oh wow that's awesome <@300033838065778702>;;
Yeah I know what you mean, I've got the same coverage;;
yeah, i think maybe closer to 500 it would be needed to be limited <@488734758847905803>;;
I have insurance on my dongle, in case it dangles to hard and falls out of the port;;
I agree <@207416847019016202>;;
Hahaha;;
Damn <@498246547838992414> I'm jealous of that dongleness;;
dongle insurance is a must. must keep the dongle safe;;
Cover that dongle;;
i should check if my insurance is including dongles;;
I need to buy like 10 dongles and learn to juggle;;
*YOUTUBE CONTENT*;;
Definitely should;;
Im glad we had this talk so you remembered orange;;
Lmao <@498246547838992414>;;
YouTube content hahaha;;
I know how to juggle rocks;;
Really? I can't juggle at all;;
Yeah, I always did it near people I didn't like;;
Juggling huge boulders;;
*alpha male dongle strength*;;
Lmao;;
But juggling uneven objects is easier than them things in the circus;;
And balls;;
Ballz;;
Balls are hard;;
Juggle my balls and dongle;;
Oh god;;
Hahaahha;;
<:GoldMango:499310401289191434>;;
That looks like a crisp;;
Me likey;;
Damn, I j;;
Keep falling asleep and waking up. Should I play with my dongle?;;
morning;;
Morning  <@459504171113250837>;;
<@348165887347523594> how u doing;;
Good and very sleepy. How about you?;;
<@459504171113250837> Good afternoon, mr. Pool;;
<@348165887347523594> doing good just catching up on all u cool peeps;;
üòâ;;
yooo <@488734758847905803> , you need to go on karak's discord now. I'm dying . Takedown is too much hahahahaha;;
Hahahah takedown is hilarious;;
<@488734758847905803> hooo lord, this boy;;
üòÇ;;
Guess who's got diarrhea at mini works?;;
World*;;
I do;;
;;
Everything is 1:24 scale;;
We got thing lile this in St Petersburg;;
Russia model;;
NIce, I need to get the hell out my tiny island;;
Well and I would like to visit your island, but I suspect it's expensive  <@348165887347523594>;;
I've met many Russians here. I've actually rented a house from a beach house from a Russian couple once. I don't know how much it cost for a trip from Russian to Martinique though.;;
In juin, I rent my own beach apartment for 60 or 55 euros per day;;
well and its France? Do you need France shengen visa to go there?;;
Yeah;;
haha thats a bitch;;
I forgot about that visa thing. Is it hard to get?;;
well its not very hard but not easy too;;
Good job <@!207416847019016202>, your dongle just grew to 19!;;
im too lazy for this paper shit;;
Hahaha I totally hear you;;
you need all these kind of documents, from bank, from work, you need to pay fee and then wait;;
and my gf doesnt work, so for her get such a visa will be more problematic, adding all these sponsorship documents and such;;
so next time we will have money, it will be some visa-free country;;
I couldn't agree more with you <@207416847019016202>;;
Can't wait till the world becomes visa-free;;
Seriously, it's already hard and expensive enough to travel .  I mean, for a stay under a month in a foreign country it shouldn' t be has hard as they make it.;;
haha yeah <@348165887347523594>;;
travelling is hard;;
<@488734758847905803> agree, but it wont happen;;
That looks awesome I‚Äôm jelly lol <@488734758847905803>;;
Hey all! Been awhile lol;;
I would love to live in a foreign country for a few years;;
But yeah, it's pretty impossible lol;;
hey <@416803598173995018>;;
how youve been;;
Busy! Work has been nuts. I don't get my usual time to hang out on here anymore which sucks. How have you been?;;
its other way for me, not much at work these days <@416803598173995018>;;
but i started to stream a little more;;
got some fere time at home;;
Nice! Wish I had more of that lol. Haven't streamed much in the last week cause I'm too exhausted by the time I get home;;
youre in a food service right?;;
What‚Äôs up <@416803598173995018>;;
<@287320205020102667> whats going on?;;
<@207416847019016202> yes I am;;
well i wish you a lot of money and a little of work <@416803598173995018>;;
lol thanks man. I did just get a raise but the workload went up. I did however get an interview yesterday with Activision so that would be cool! I don't really like food service much;;
thats cool <@416803598173995018>;;
though of course i hate activision;;
what would you be doing there?;;
I also am not a huge fan of them but I want to get into the gaming industry so this would obviously help. It's an associate specialist position. Basically financial stuff, tracking spending, budgets and payments etc;;
Not much man just working and you;;
That's awesome <@416803598173995018> ! Hope you have good news to tell us soon;;
Good job <@!488734758847905803>, your dongle just grew to 21!;;
Hope so! Just waiting to hear back on a date and time for the phone interview;;
Also, sorry to hear you're working so much. Soon you'll be streaming and talking here again :);;
Nice;;
Hope so man;;
I'll send the most positive of vibes;;
Gotta get that dongle to grow!;;
Thats the biggest dongle ive ever seen <@488734758847905803>;;
Lol üòÇ <@416803598173995018>;;
Hahaha it'll only get bigger <@207416847019016202>;;
Yeah <@416803598173995018> !;;
And in a couple weeks you'll be streamer of the week!;;
<@502171199850414081> , don't forget to post your schedule;;
Afternoon everyone;;
Afternoon <@311684705810513921>;;
hi <@311684705810513921>;;
How's your days going?;;
<@488734758847905803> Yeah Im prepping for that so I can have time lol;;
mine is good, almost ending;;
where are you from <@311684705810513921>;;
I live in KY;;
what is that?;;
<@207416847019016202> it's an abbreviation for Kentucky. It's a state in America;;
well i know its a state;;
didnt know that abbreviation;;
and i love KFC;;
oh ok lol. Yeah we have abbreviations for every state here. I definitely do not know them all lol;;
I cant remember the last time I had KFC. It was probably 15 years ago lol;;
haha;;
Hey @everyone;;
are you vegetarian or something? <@416803598173995018>;;
hey <@448648678224429068>;;
How‚Äôs it going <@207416847019016202>;;
its all good, how are you <@448648678224429068>;;
I‚Äôm doing good thanks;;
<@207416847019016202> oh god no, not at all lol. I eat bacon everyday. Just not a big fast food guy;;
Whats up? <@448648678224429068> how you been?;;
haha thats good <@416803598173995018>;;
<@207416847019016202> Im big into fitness lol so fast food is a no no for me. I eat it maybe once a year as a cheat meal when I get a bad craving;;
ahah i understand that <@416803598173995018>;;
but myself i love fast food;;
well, not all of it;;
I do love some. There's a burger chain on the west of the states called in and out and I loooooove their food but its always madness there and crazy lines so I hardly go;;
i loved Wendies when it was in Russia;;
but they had only like 8 places and then closed;;
oh yeah I do like that place too lol;;
thats too bad theyre gone over there now;;
yeah;;
mainly here is mcdonalds, kfc and burger king;;
i dont love burger king and daily mcdonalds menu (bet eat it sometimes);;
and i love kfc and morning macdonalds;;
morning has completely different quality of meat (or whatever it is);;
morning mcdonalds is damn good. youre right, totally different than the other stuff;;
I‚Äôve been good how you been <@416803598173995018>;;
<@416803598173995018> exactly, totally different;;
<@448648678224429068> just busy man, work has been nuts the past 2 weeks. Hardly had time to get on here or stream;;
finished episode 3 of The Council. Story still holds, but maybe i will need another opinion of someone who played it, to compare if we had any differeences in a story;;
Wassup chat;;
I need to blast through it. I played episode 1 and forgot the story before episode 2 came out <@207416847019016202>;;
I hear ya <@416803598173995018>;;
hi <@345984543246909442> , how are you;;
i suggest you can replay episode one before starting second, its not that big <@193534318704852993>;;
thats also not very good thing about episodes - that you start to forget what was in previous;;
thats why i try to consume episodic games and shows only when at least full season there;;
or better, all seasons;;
Yeah it‚Äôs usually not a big deal but I remember not being particularly blown away by the first episode;;
i agree, if you checked out first episode when there was only one, maybe 1st episode dont appears to be worth waiting for other episodes <@193534318704852993>;;
but if already got them all, and start playing, it feels more like whole story;;
Hey guys what up?;;
Went to an ice bar;;
-22 degrees;;
Shit was cold af;;
;;
‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§;;
I gave up on sleeping lmao;;
My  bronchitis is owning me;;
Oh damn dude;;
Sorry to hear that it's still bothering you;;
I think you should go to the hospital;;
Yeah, Think so too;;
And the rest of the shit, all built up, I just relaxed as good as I could;;
And try to forget it all for at least a couple hours;;
Yeah;;
Try to read;;
Meditate;;
I'll read the rest of your novel;;
Oh yeah!;;
That'd be dope;;
Btw @everyone next stream (25th of January) will have new art and new alerts!;;
And the mango tree server icon will be new too;;
I read the 1st page, but it was late;;
DONGLE?;;
Who knows?;;
It's a surprise!;;
Oh true;;
It's a very rough draft;;
Hope you like it :);;
But please be honest if you don't;;
I won't be offended at all;;
Ah, I'm sure I will, but I'm always honest;;
Good to know;;
Yeah, I will never say anything to anyone about something that they've worked on and tell them it's good when It's not etc;;
;;

I think I need to wait a bit before we get insurance.;;
Now, who‚Äôs getting RE2 and why?;;
<@488734758847905803> <@300033838065778702> just trying to wake myself up right now.  All is going well so far, with the exception of my cold I somehow acquired lol;;
<@456226577798135808> I insured mine for like ‚Ç¨6900;;
Lol;;
<@456226577798135808> I will be getting RE2 once I have the money for it.  The demo was awesome.;;
<@498246547838992414> does the insurance premium increase when your dongle grows?;;
Not sure but has anyone confirmed if it will have multiplayer?;;
<@300033838065778702> Yes;;
anything for the dongle growth then lol;;
Your dongle is your most valuable asset;;
Don't let it fall off;;
Hey <@456226577798135808> , long time no see;;
Nice food <@207416847019016202>;;
I am <@456226577798135808>;;
That shit is nostalgic for me;;
First horror game I ever played and I was absolutely terrified to play it;;
All that dongle talk and nobody is worried about dingleberries?;;
Now I'm excited to be terrified again;;
<@153630383236186112> I prefer dongleberries;;
Fair enough üòÇ;;
It does increase <@300033838065778702>;;
LMAO <@153630383236186112>;;
If you want some more context on the dongle stuff there are some highlights;;

Off to the canyons of Cambar√° do sul;;

It's Portuguese <@498246547838992414>;;
Hahaha don't hate the Hitman <@207416847019016202> , he might pay you a visit;;
Glad you liked the clips <@153630383236186112>;;
the Hitman will come for your dongle;;
he will not survive in russia even couple minutes <@488734758847905803>;;
<@488734758847905803> I don't know, my brain is in my dongle;;
LUL;;
Lmao <@300033838065778702>;;

Hey everyone :);;
Hey  <@486507510635823104>;;
<@207416847019016202>  how u doing? üòä;;
I'm good, how are you  <@486507510635823104>;;

<@207416847019016202>  yes it is üòÇ and I'll try thank you üòä;;
Okay, back now. Yea RE2 looks like some good fun. Trying to figure out if I want digital or disc. Not sure yet.;;
I did digital for RDR2.;;
Morning everyone;;
I like the digital aspect of games if ya have the space but man, something also concerns me with digital titles. Basically you are the mercy of Sony or MS not pulling it down or internet connection to make sure you actually ‚Äúown‚Äù the game.;;
I know with my PS4, when there was some kind of disconnect with the internet, I would have to rebuild the database for the digital titles since I was locked out of them. Don‚Äôt like that shit.;;
Morning  <@508094590436507668>;;
Sorry everyone i ain't been around my internet got cut off so been without net but it's back on and I'm back;;
Hi  <@465946482474745866>;;
Hey how are you;;
<@456226577798135808> I understand concerns about not be able to play if sony  decide to turn off servers, but personally I do only digital more than 10 years now I think;;
I'm good, just finished work and heading home, how are you  <@465946482474745866>;;
Yeah digital only on sale. Otherwise physical (mostly for collection or exchange for a new game );;
Am good just updating stuff on my ps4;;
What you mean exchange?  <@455797717763883009>;;
Some stores offer you discount when you bring disc?;;
Like trade-in;;
Exactly;;
I don't know, for me you only really own game when you buy it digitally. Because you can't lose it or scratch disc and such. You will lose it only if digital store like steam will close, and it has less changes to happen, than losing disc;;
I got RDR2 for 50%;;
Morning;;
50% is good;;
Morning  <@459504171113250837>;;
And I gave 2 discs, maybe 6-10 months old game;;
Thats strange for me. What do they do with old discs? Sell them like used?  <@455797717763883009>;;
<@455797717763883009> Yeah, thats typically how I handle my game purchases. However, as of late, I am tend to be buying more of my games digitally. But then I started thinking about potential issue with digital copies too.;;
<@207416847019016202> yeah you can find used discs for cheaper;;
I hardly buy discs anymore. Its just a convenience thing for me I guess;;
Surprisingly I haven't made any purchase this year;;
So far;;
lol me either. I spent too much last year so I am scaling back this year;;
so youve got rdr2 on discs. ps4? how many discs it is?;;
<@455797717763883009>;;
2 discs;;
For the Xbox;;
Oh okay, good  <@455797717763883009>;;
Hello mangos!!!;;
Y'all still sweet today?;;
good to see you <@348165887347523594>;;
im right now reading fix list for atom RPG new patch  (i know that you dont care much about the game itself), and im hyped for tomorrow because i think they fixed one quest i couldnt finish;;
Cool bro. It's all good to me too. If it makes the game better, it's all for the best. I'll be watching;;
Good to see you too <@207416847019016202>;;
Hey all you awesome mangos üòÉ;;
hi awesome <@287320205020102667>;;
"i like <@348165887347523594> 's attitude, something like ""i dont care about the game, but if it mean youll stream, its ok""";;
What‚Äôs up broski;;
Exactly <@207416847019016202> , I just like the narration. It's like an audio book üòÇ , with visuals;;
<@287320205020102667> ;;
lol i had to google this word and what i found;;
Broskis are guys that would do anything for each other, excluding: homosexual activity, dressing up in women's clothes, and lending a shoulder to cry on (broskis don't cry).;;
so no women's clothes then;;
lmao;;
<@348165887347523594> you said once that you would stream if you had better internet.;;
whats the problem? there are no good internet on martinique, or it too expensive? or not all places has acces to it?;;
Hahahaha <@207416847019016202>;;
<@207416847019016202> Where I live we only have basic adsl. My maximum download speed it 5mb/s and upload is a joke lol. 700 kb/s üòÖ;;
is it limit of your district or something, or whole island? <@348165887347523594>;;
I've been waiting for fiber optic for years, seems that it won't get to my neighborhood any time soon;;
i get it, i lived once in a part of a city (not moscow) that was little far from downtown (2 km actually lol), and even didnt have adsl at a time <@348165887347523594>;;
<@207416847019016202> Yeah, that is it;;
and my friend lived liked 5 km from the city, and he had to use satellite internet;;
there were some great perks of satellite internet though;;
Like what?;;
at that time speed of usual internet was not that good;;
and when you used satellite internet, you had to have some internet for outgoing traffic (he has gprs), but ingoing traffic was from satellite and was fast.;;
so, what he actually did, he used some software to catch all traffic that came from sattelite (not only for him), filter this traffic to find something useful like games or movies, and download it;;
so in the time of slow internet he could catch several movies in a night;;
and other my friends downloaded 900 mb film for a several days at that time;;
lmao;;
it was my main door into having gbs of porn <@348165887347523594>;;
hahahahaha;;
I hear you;;
it was something like 2006-2007;;
I've got a 4g modem box earlier this week. It works pretty well. Usually I get around 12mb/s seconds download with it and around 4 mb/s upload. But there is a data cap of 100Gb on with my subscription.  Yesterday I was already at 30gb. So now I'm gonna keep it only when watching twitch streams. I'll keep using my adsl line for the usual stuff.;;
100Gb  a month? <@348165887347523594>;;
Yeah, it's not really meant for my type of usage. It's targeting people that can't have normal internet access. I got it only for twitch. I was ok with what I had. So I'll just keep doing as usual and use the 4g access when I'll be watching twitch streams.;;
thats fucking terrible;;
i turned on my pc 6 hours ago and it already downloaded 95 gbs;;
not counting my gfs laptop and 2 phones;;
Yeah, it is bad indeed but I haven't seen any 4g services that aren't data caped. Have you?;;
<@207416847019016202> I download a lot me too. I'm always adding movies to my download queue;;
Even in the US, most 4g services are data caped;;
and while we speaked, it went up to 97 gbs;;
i agree, i didnt see any 4g without cap either.;;
but it still generally sucks that you dont have access to normal internet;;
With you bandwidth you're swallowing the entire internet lol;;
yep;;
i have 200 mbit/s;;
maximum that you can get here;;
like, in my appartment in moscow;;
didnt see anyone who would offer me better connection;;
about caps... i have 10 gb cap on my phone, and it wasnt enough when i listened google music every day..;;
but then i bought second phone just for music, and didnt bought sim card for it, i just download music from google play while on wifi;;
so now no problems with cap;;
Wow, I guess we all adapt ourselves with what we've got;;
Thats true;;
I have never felt like my adsl line wasn't enough in term of speed(no cap). I can watch everything at 1080p on netflix and youtube and other services with no stuttering what so ever. I've got the 4g thing only for twitch . And I started watching twitch streams like less than a month ago.;;
My phone 4g is caped at 30g;;
thats very good, but i think 30gb on a phone would be too much even for me;;
and too expensive;;
unlimited data for me on my phone lol;;
i paid something like 10 bucks / month for my phone, and it pretty expensive, comparing to other people;;
damn only 10?;;
haha;;
brb moving to Russia lol;;
dont forget that im living in a poor country with low salaries and fucking expensive devices <@416803598173995018>;;
we had talk with callison recently, he just bought capture card for 125 bucks, i looked up, and here its 500 bucks!!!;;
and in moscow average person make 500-700 bucks a month <@416803598173995018>;;
oh wow;;
thats crazy!;;
so it would be good living here if you working some office work, like IT and such;;
im for example make 2000, and its not much for java programmer in moscow, but like i said, other people make under 1000;;
I make $1000 a week roughly to put that into perspective. Thats crazy. I know nothing about IT so I wouldnt make it lol;;
we have our prices for regular stuff like food little cheaper then in europe and usa, but prices for electronics sometime crazy;;
<@416803598173995018> lucky you;;
<@416803598173995018> how much iphone costs in usa by the way?;;
<@207416847019016202> 30g is way more that I need, I usually never use over 2 to 3gigs on my phone's plan;;
<@348165887347523594>  several years ago, when i had something like 8-10 mbit/s, me and my brother used to download youtube videos and watch them from pc, to not have problems during watching from browser.;;
and now i can have several open tabs in browsers with twitch and youtube in 1080p, and not having any problems;;
yeah a lot of stuff is expensive where I live in Los Angeles. Iphone is around $700-$800 I think. I do monthly payments;;
<@348165887347523594> the same, i use not more than 5 gb now without music;;
<@416803598173995018> iphone 10X 64 gb costs around 1000 here;;
damn;;
gas is crazy expensive here. Whats it like in Russia?;;
and MANY people have iphones actually lol <@416803598173995018>;;
i dont know if you know what litr is, but its something about 6-7 bucks for a litr <@416803598173995018>;;
fuck;;
<@416803598173995018>  Here, it's not really about the internet speed. The price doesn't change. Where I live my 8m/s adsl plan has the same price than what I have in my beach house which has vdsl that goes up to 30mb/s second. It's just the access that is an issue. As for prices, yeah the last iphone is over 1000 euros. I don't care cause I think it's fucking crazy to spend so much on a phone device;;
gas you meant for fuel for a car ? <@416803598173995018>;;
<@207416847019016202> yeah, its about $5 average a gallon here. Sorry Im not familiar with the metric system. I wish stupid america would switch to it though;;
<@348165887347523594> where do you live?;;
i dont have a car, but everyone bitching about gas prices all the time;;
Martinique, but to simplify it for you lets just say France;;
i googled gallon is 3,78541 litres <@416803598173995018>;;
so its 4 times more expensive here;;
DAMN!;;
I wont complain anymore lol;;
<@207416847019016202> Gaz is verry expensive in France, much much much more higher than in the US. When I lived in the US I never cared about gaz prices;;
thats why mango always translate his prices for other countries;;
like, something costs 20 bucks, and he saying that its 80;;
<@207416847019016202> Here too it's four time more expensive than the US;;
<@348165887347523594> thats by st lucia, correct?;;
because if your hear 20 you think its not much, but for poor countries its much;;
<@416803598173995018> Yeah, but it's a State of France;;
Ahh ok, I did not know that;;
<@416803598173995018> This is why it's easier to just say France lol;;
<@416803598173995018> What people in other countries call the main land France, we call it Metropole;;
<@348165887347523594> parlez vous francais?;;
Oui lol;;
I'm Franco American, French mother , American father;;
haha i want to declare that i hate your french oui <@348165887347523594>;;
ill try to explain;;
lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
pardon. mon francais n'est pas bon lol;;
dont even know if thats right;;
It's right <@416803598173995018> no mistake here;;
my grandmother is from france. well one is, the other is german on my moms side;;
ok;;
in normal world, in programming, people have 1 for yes and 0 for no;;
and for my work i support french written code a lot, and for france 0 is YES and 1 is NO, because this fucking oui looks like 0;;
I totally see what you mean <@207416847019016202> , I hate doing any type of computer work in french. Actually I never do.;;
in my life i read a tonn of comments in code in french;;
i hate it lol;;
When it comes to scripting or programing my servers, I just ignore the french bs;;
The French language tends to complicate everything;;
lol thats confusing <@207416847019016202>;;
exactly!;;
thats very confusing;;
and we, stupid russians, add our code to it, and we use 1 for yes, and it becomes MORE confusing;;
Which language are you programing on?;;
java;;
but french code im talking about mostly on java/c pro/pl sql;;
c pro is some modified c++ for oracle;;
for using with oracle sql;;
Nice, I've lost all my programing skills. It's been so long since I ever used it. The last language I studied was python. But my life did't go in this direction. I'd love to get back in my books and re-learn and get back on track but I simply have no reasons to. All I do now is programing apache servers, ssh servers and other scripting stuff not to complicated. Mostly I.T work.;;
I try to never install the gui on my linux servers to stay sharp;;
well all linux i use is also in command line <@348165887347523594>;;
and i hate fucking bash script language;;
i write rarely in it;;
but still;;
its fucking pain, its not programming language, its for perverts;;
everything in it;;
I still use batch scripting just for the sake of it. So I don't forget everything. Linux also, I write those scripts when I don't even need to.  Just to stay sharp.;;
well you know, i like when language is self-explanatory;;
when you can guess how you can use it;;
but with bash, you just need to read manual and remember it;;
I've been thinking about getting back into programing with visual basics. To smoothen out the process;;
for example, if you need to check thats string is empty, you will NEVER guess that you should add -z to IF command;;
you have to read and remember it;;
<@207416847019016202> It's true, I always need my notes next to what I'm writing;;
by the way i know python a little, because my gf kind of studying it, and sometimes i get inveolved to help;;
"in java or pl sql i can write most of things out from my head, but with bash its like ""lets open my old script, copy it in a new file, and change""";;
I don't think I'll get back to python at this point. Neither c++. Since visual basic is heavily c++ based and may be more useful for the little things I may need it for. Or maybe should I try java;;
it depends of what you want to write;;
every language good for its purposes;;
but still there no harm to write everything in language that you know good;;
It's been like 12 years since last time I used python, and even longer since I learned c++. This shit is long gone;;
haha;;
for me otherwise, i came to programming just last several years;;
I still want to get back to it. Maybe you can be some help;;
What do you need?  <@348165887347523594>;;
my network card just started do crazy shit and internet turned off on my pc, i had to restart. hope it wont happen tomorrow;;
Same thing here. I'm experiencing lots of weird issues. Right now I have to use my phone;;
I'll be back in a few. I need to sort out this shit;;
Looking for people who are free to be mods in my channel;;
What's your schedule?;;
Then I can see if I can join often or not;;
6pm to 11pm UK time just banned a trash talker in my stream saying he hopes I get cancer etc;;
Yeah, I can manage that, only if you want me to be a mod that is, I have a lot of free time;;
Need one I kinda kept cool but at same time was fuming my twitch name is draconsos;;
Okay, I think I'm following already, not sure though;;
I also can't stand toxic people in chat;;
unfortunately toxic people are everywhere. They seem to mostly be in the rainbow six siege community lol;;
I have experienced soooo much awful stuff playing that gamr;;
game*;;
I just joined the stream <@465946482474745866>;;
What up mango seeeeeeeeds?;;
I went to the canyons but it was misty;;

Ho yeah, don't worry, not going to either lol. <@287320205020102667>  I was focusing on what was happening to <@311684705810513921> . Which is a reality.;;
Castlevania was pretty good;;
Yeah;;
Started watching anime on my off time, goblin slayer and the time I was reincarnated as a slime are pretty good;;
Just started the rising of the shield hero today and omfg that's good.;;
Yeah, I'm not big into anime, but I can respect it;;
<@111826600395378688> Castlevania last fight was epic;;
Yea but it hit me with the feels doe;;
Hey what's up <@488734758847905803> sorry to hear that lol. I know the feeling. I hope you still did enjoy your day. Even with the rain üòÖ;;

Haha aw, thanks for the amazing words!;;
I love having you here dude;;
i see dongle era is finished, now its ass age;;
O jeez lol;;
Why does the dongle era need to die?;;
"new welcome mesage now will be ""welcome into big mangos ass""";;
Can't asses and dongles live in harmony?;;
Hahahahah;;
<@488734758847905803> because you killed it with ass;;
with asstalk;;
"we can even invent some new idiome ""dont try to asstalk me""";;
Noooo;;
Hahaha;;
Omfg that's hilarious;;
Don't dongle talk me;;
With that ass talk;;
üíÄ;;
Haha;;
Can't wait to be back streaming with you guys;;
Wait what's this ass talk going on. Did I miss the fun?;;
i see you have set up asstalk notifications on your discord <@272988530278662146>;;
My interests was peaked;;
Hahahahahahaah <@207416847019016202>;;
Lmfao your something else <@207416847019016202> üòÇ;;

F;;
Yikes my condolences;;
<@207416847019016202> when you said invent a new idiome ‚Äúdon‚Äôt try to asstalk me‚Äù that reminded of like someone from a non English speaking country learning English and then trying to say the slang trash talk ‚Äú don‚Äôt try shit talk me‚Äù lmfao;;
haha yeah <@287320205020102667>;;
im exactly that guy, learning english;;
lol;;
Hahaha;;
<@207416847019016202> when learning English collides with being hilarious;;
haha thanks <@488734758847905803>;;
I don't spit words that ain't the truth dude hah;;
haha;;
btw, about learning;;
remember how i said that your russian accent is more like italian? <@488734758847905803>;;
<@488734758847905803> you can speak russian?;;
accent;;
not russian language;;
Ho just the accent lol;;
when he speaks english with russian accent;;
yeah got you;;
thats because russian accent that you can hear in movies is too exaggerated, not too real;;
but i noticed funny thing;;
I  see;;
Interesting;;
My accent is just like in the movies though lmao;;
that on my streams, when i do russian accent, its not really russian, its 50% me trying to speak correctly, and 50% italian;;
Oh damn really? Hahahaahha;;
my true russian accent would be more simple;;
Yeah <@348165887347523594> , I m good at accents;;
Interesting <@207416847019016202>;;
i thought about it just couple of days ago;;
<@488734758847905803> Yeah, I can remember that from that stream that went totally dongle lol;;
Hahahaahahahha;;
I didn't even do the Brazilian speaking English lmao;;
<@207416847019016202> You totally sound like Arthyom though;;
<@488734758847905803> next stream haha;;
"you know, this strange english ""th"" sound, which is not present in russian language. i noticed that sometimes i try to pronounce it correctly, and its definitely not russian accent, so its that 50% correct part. and then i remember that i need to do accent, and start using this exaggerated movie accent";;
<@348165887347523594> whos artyom? from metro?;;
<@207416847019016202> hooo that's why;;
Hmm;;
Yeah from metro;;
Interesting;;
Portuguese also doesn't have the th sound;;
artyom dont have h in it lol <@348165887347523594>;;
"I think that english is the only language I know of that has the ""th"" sound";;
"<@207416847019016202> ho yeah lol, speaking of ""th"" I got confused üòÖ";;
Lmao;;
What plans do you guys have for the weekend M;;
?;;
getting snowed in;;
Nothing at all, gaming that's pretty much it. Trying to save money;;
about to go out and get some yummy food (hopefully my stomach will work with is) and we are getting like 16 inches tonight;;
my wife will only get 2 inches ; ;
ill be streaming tomorrow morning for my top viewer <@348165887347523594> , then will repair my pc a little, and in sunday will go to my parents to put new years plastic tree in the storage on their balcony <@488734758847905803>;;
The French accent isn't exaggerated though, it really sounds like in the movies. I use to make fun of my English teachers and taunt them;;
<@207416847019016202> thank you <@207416847019016202> , you got me all emotional here;;
<@111826600395378688> Enjoy your meal;;
i talked to several frenches for my work, and fuck. no offense, but french accent is terrible, theres some details that make it hard to understand to russian people <@348165887347523594>;;
lol;;
no thank you <@348165887347523594>;;
Damn really <@111826600395378688> ?;;
Time to game lol;;
I just think that it's funny to hear in English <@207416847019016202>;;
Hahahahahahahaha damn that was a good one <@111826600395378688>;;
If you talk in here a lot your dongle will grow;;
True that <@207416847019016202> , that's the worst part of Christmas isn't it?;;
<@488734758847905803> more than 2 inches hahahahaha;;
"and im understand french accent pretty good. but my several colleagues were like ""what the fuck these french guys saying? we dont understand them""";;
<@207416847019016202> were they speaking russian of english?;;
"Thing my makes it funny is that we pronounce ""r' in our throats , unlike other languages that tend to be more on the tip of the tongue";;
<@488734758847905803> haha thats actually funny, that for this new year we had real tree, and plastic tree we had several years, and didnt used it this time, and decided to get rid of it now. so its not directly connected to end of holidays;;
<@348165887347523594> english, i talk here only about english;;
i know one french who talks russian, but generally i meant english;;
I don't have the French accent when I speak English though.  Like I said before, it makes it worst in my case. Cause people don't get why my English is bad.  Just makes me sound stupid haha;;
i know one guy from france whos english is wonderful. but hes chinese lol;;
I spoke english before I spoke French. Then I lost it growing up. I came back when I was a teenager moving back and forth .;;
But I haven't spoke English for about 10 years now;;
<@207416847019016202> hahaha;;
what makes french english accent hard for russians to understand, that they pronounce some words 2 times faster than we, and with intonation on different letter. i cant come up with example now, but you basically trying to figure out what kind of word you just heard;;
<@207416847019016202> I see what you mean;;
"it has something with sound ""i""";;
its too important in french as i understand;;
and we never intonate this sound so much;;
"i is only pronounced ""e"" for us";;
"maybe its ""y"" then";;
or e;;
"Also pronounced only as ""e""";;
well i meant that sound like oui;;
i will show you on stream üòÄ;;
Kelly can be written Kelli or Kellie and still sounds the same.;;
<@207416847019016202> Yeah no problem üòÉ;;
Oh cool <@207416847019016202> , I prefer real trees too;;
do you even have christmas type of trees in brasil <@488734758847905803> ?;;
or is it imported?;;
<@207416847019016202> As for most Frenches, Spanish and Portuguese are the easy languages to learn. It comes naturally;;
We do, but nobody has room for a real one in their apartments;;
They're called pine trees in English btw, just in case you forgot or don't know;;
i honestly dont even know what language is easy to learn for russians <@348165887347523594> ;;
besides of course all kinds of slavic languages;;
<@207416847019016202> We use plastic Christmas trees in tropical countries <@207416847019016202>  Yes we have pine trees here too, like <@488734758847905803> mentioned. But no body has space for this. But we grow them in our gardens.;;
<@207416847019016202> It should be English , as it's in the family of Germanic languages. Well I think, I'm not sure if Russian is a Germanic language.;;
pine is only one sort of them <@488734758847905803> ;;
there is also fir-tree (i dont now if its the real name, but google told me so);;
"fir-tree is kinda super popular in russia as new years tree, it sound ""yuolka"" in russian";;
even if its pine, we still say just yuolka;;
<@207416847019016202> No body takes the time to grow a pine tree here to cut it for Christmas. It's not that common. It's harder to grow.;;
russian is eastern slavic language;;
Ok, so it won't be English then, nor a latin language.;;
haha in russia theress a lot of that kind of trees;;
Ah yes, there are Douglas firs;;
Regular firs;;
Frenches learn fast any latin language as lots of words are similar...I mean very very similar;;
Yeah that's true;;
"so we just call all that kind of tree ""fir""";;
All Latin languages are easier once you know one;;
<@488734758847905803> Exactly;;
and we dont say like christmas fir, or new years fir. just fir;;
and its kinda clear, that you mean holiday tree;;
<@207416847019016202> yaaa lol;;
In french it's called Sapin, all of them are called sapin, and it basically means Pine tree;;
By the way <@488734758847905803> I never mentioned that both my father's parents are Cubans.;;
i dont know what you meant when you both said that people in your countries dont have place at home for trees. <@348165887347523594> <@488734758847905803> ;;
as you can see this small fir is fit good in a small space between my door and kitchen;;
Oh really <@348165887347523594> ?;;
That's super interesting because I want to know more about Cuba;;
picture was taken before we dressed it up;;
But I am reluctant to believe in what the media or whatever says;;
Usually pine trees are bigger I guess here;;
Because the ones I see are huge af;;
well i dont quite understand;;
of course there are huge pine trees;;
<@488734758847905803> Me too, he has been planning on going there for some vacations. I still haven't got a chance to go up there.;;
but who would have take huge tree at home?;;
so they search for small ones;;
but i understand that russia have better choice of different size trees;;
<@207416847019016202> This is because you guys have pine trees like crazy. So you can get them in all sizes;;
thats why i asked if your countries import it <@348165887347523594>;;
Down here you will not see small pine trees has , only big ones cause people don't cut them;;
It's not that common even though it still grows pretty well here. Just not common and it is used to embellish gardens;;
You will never see someone cut a pine tree just for Christmas. I don't know for brazil though;;
here were are talking about russian selection of trees, but whats funny that tree on my photo is imported in russia from Norway;;
really ? üòÖ;;
yeah;;
i dont know why really;;
I need to run to the store. I'll be back in about 20 mn if you're still around;;
Hahahaha;;
That's hilarious;;
Ok cool;;
Drive safe <@348165887347523594>;;
Or walk safe, don't know what method of transportation you'll be using lmao;;
Yeah thanks. It's like 2 minutes from my home haha. I'll be walking;;
we got it in huge chain supermarket, maybe its cheaper for them import it in big quantites. russian ones usually sold on the street markets;;
What's the name of the supermarket?;;
I'm curious;;
I know the Albert heijn from holland;;
its only russian chain;;
Lenta;;
we also have french chain Auschan in russia, they sell like everything;;
Hm;;
I was curious if you had Carrefour;;
Which we have here in Brazil, it's French;;
and also french chain Leroy Merlin, but they only sell materials for repair and building and such;;
thats only foreign big chaines;;
Oh shit we have that too;;
also of course we have billion clothes foreign shops;;
They're expensive af though;;
Leroy Merlin?;;
or you mean clothes?;;
also of course we got ikea, but its too non food supermarket;;
ive heard about Carrefour, but we dont have that;;
Yeah, Leroy Merlin;;
We don't have Ikea;;
i actually buy some useful things at leroy merlin from time to time;;
for example, here on this photo my old black IKEA table, and i wanted to extend it somehow, to not sit to close to really big TV.;;
i bought this 5 bucks piece of wood in Leroy Merlin and just screwed it (dont think that its correct word) to table.;;
and for storage i use several plastic boxes from leroy merlin that just stands on my balcony in snow all winter;;
i store there different shit like screwdrivers and such;;
Oh cool;;
Yeah our Leroy Merlin has some shitty Chinese stuff that is way too overpriced;;
Just got my new lights from amazon sale $20s;;
fuck, thats a lot of monitors <@111826600395378688>;;
hahaha, I don't even care about the lights. All I see are screens screens screes everywhere;;
exactly;;
üòÇ;;
I've seen the picture first, I thought the caption would say I just got my new setup;;
<@207416847019016202> We have Carrefour all around here.;;
Nice <@111826600395378688> , I need lights like that myself;;
Lmao <@348165887347523594>;;
These lights special for streamers?;;
I just got game over in Mario Galaxy.... <:danBad:530284165480972298>;;

im good <@217089479863697418>;;
what you mean by game over? you lose?;;
"Yeah, like I actually ran out of lives in the game.  Then it slaps you in the face, saying ""you've had a rough time, maybe you should take a break"" <:danLUL:527956675857088532>";;
fuck thats awful;;
i would never return to game after this;;
its like permanent death?;;
You have to restart the level/world that you were on.;;
Good job <@!217089479863697418>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
"hahaha, when you said,  ""hey guys, you remember when we had 25 lives""...I was dying üòÉ";;
I went from 25 lives to 0...;;

üòÇ;;
Don't feel too bad <@217089479863697418> , I sucks too hahaga;;

Goodnight everyone;;

Welcome <@312379820933906442>;;
So I'm terrible.;;
Just spent 125 dollars for groceries at Walmart and I'm in the taco bell drive thru;;
üòÇ üòÇ;;
üòÇ;;
Hahaha;;
Morning everyone;;
Morning all. Been watching <@207416847019016202> stream since 3am  üòÉ;;
fuck man, stop this crazy shit and go to sleep lol <@348165887347523594>;;
üòÇ üòÇ;;
One man streaming?;;
Well better say hello at least;;
Yeah, you should come check it out <@272988530278662146>;;
I did and dude that accent. Fucking awesome.  Sadly though my phone battery is at 9 percent lol. I got it set up so I can see when he goes live. I better get to a charger lol;;
Ho very cool. Yeah, I love the accent. I'm pushing him to stream as much as he can haha. Feels like I'm listening to an audio book. Once he gets to 50 fallowers it'll be easier for me to watch his streams. Right now he still has only one resolution available;;
It was awesome <@207416847019016202> . How long was that? like 5 hours?;;
actually just 3.5;;
i had to run sadly;;
thank you very much guys <@272988530278662146> <@300033838065778702>  <@348165887347523594>  for being there, following and chatting;;
No problem, actually <@207416847019016202> , I have to work in 40 minutes.;;
also thanks <@272988530278662146> for your kind words;;

No, but my work will only last 2 hours max, I'll go to sleep if I'm sleepy afterword;;
<@207416847019016202> Good day and good luck for what you have to do. Again, it was great and the pleasure was mine üòâ;;
Mine too, thank you  <@348165887347523594>;;
<@207416847019016202> not a problem brother. Hope to get to hang with you a little but longer next time;;
Welcome to the shade of the mango tree <@312379820933906442> , thanks for joining us;;
How are ya?;;
Lmao <@272988530278662146>;;
Morning guys;;
Morning;;
Today is our last day in this city, tomorrow we go to a place called bento Gon√ßalves, then Monday we go to Porto Alegre;;
Hey <@348165887347523594> , is it still yesterday for you or have you gone to bed yet?;;
Not yet üòÇ . And it's not gonna be any time soon.;;
I'm waiting on a call from a client. Can't even think about relaxing myself. If I do I may fall asleep;;
To make sure I don't, I'm playing a bit of Wolfenstein 2 meanwhile;;
Hahah;;
Damn dude;;
Have you ever tried meditating?;;
That shit helps;;
A ton;;
Also, my therapist taught me something that is super weird that works;;
You put your fingertips on your eyebrows then you kind of curve your hands over your eyes;;
It tells your brain it's time for sleep;;
It actually works, it's crazy;;
Really?;;
I'll try that tonight then. I don't even want to try now üòÖ;;
If I miss this call, my dongle may just fall off like an overmatured mango from its tree.;;
Your palms shouldn't touch your eyes and you can keep your eyelids semi-open;;
Hahahahah is it an Airbnb client?;;
Hey <@87241615671832576> , didn't see your morning message, how are ya?;;
No the director of a construction company I work for. I'm gonna remotely reconfigure his PC on the network. I called him yesterday evening to make sure the appointment was still standing. He was not suppose to be at work today. So if I don't answer he is gonna be mega pissed;;
hey my dude <@488734758847905803>;;
"i need photo of what you meant by ""curving your hands"" for my gf";;
"<@207416847019016202> I think that he means ""caress gently you eyelids""";;
Doing good <@488734758847905803>, IRL have just been keeping me very busy;;

Hahahah;;
Good morning mangos;;

I wanna go back to bed;;
lol;;
haha back to bed is good <@287320205020102667>;;
i just had half hour nap;;
Hey <@287320205020102667> !;;
Yeah bed never cheats;;
Never lies;;
Only good times haha;;
by the way, i finished episode 4 of The Council yesterday.;;
i want to say, that 4th episode introduced some cool mechanics;;
not so much gameplay mechanics, as i would say new story elements;;
lol <@488734758847905803>;;
Guys I am live !!!;;
Heyyyy good morning! <@502171199850414081>;;
Good morning <@287320205020102667>;;
Hiya everyone I am back home@;;
How are you ?;;
hi <@502171199850414081> !;;
hope youre doing okay;;
Hi <@207416847019016202> well i am feeling now a bit better after this hospital time thanks;;
How‚Äôs you ?;;
Morning everyone;;
im good, just chilling at saturday <@502171199850414081>;;
morning <@311684705810513921>;;
How's everyone doing?;;
<@502171199850414081> Hey! Congrats on streamer of the week. I will try to stop by. Hope you continue to feel better as well.;;
Happy to see you're doing better  <@502171199850414081>;;
I just finished The Council. Looking forward to see streams when <@278571432588345345>  and <@488734758847905803> will play it;;
without spoilering anything, adding to all that ive already said about the game, i think ive failed ending as much as i can;;
like, maximum worst ending;;
interesting;;
yeah I rly wanna play that;;
but, unlike Detroit, which you definitely fail at first time and will definitely play second, this game didnt made me to want to play second time;;
"and to be honest, ive failed because in the final chapter i was like ""yeah, whatever, i dont really feel invested in the story, so ill just agree to everything bad""";;
but if not speak about gameplay elements and choices, but just about story (whichever ending you got), i think its pretty interesting and game definitely is worth to check out and make your opinion <@278571432588345345> <@488734758847905803>;;
so i cant wait;;
Sup guys how is it going;;
Can't wait to go back to god of war on Monday;;
I 've just finished working. I'm dead. The job was much longer and harder than I expected to be . I'm tempted to just stay awake until tonight. And yeah, I'm looking forward to that stream <@278571432588345345>;;
<:letsgojonny:536238079434817536>;;
LETS GOOOOOO!!!;;
Wooo;;
lol;;
I'm finally starting to really enjoy Wolfenstein 2;;
Love that game!;;
It's pretty good indeed. The first one had a faster past though. This is why I had a hard time getting started;;
But now it's all fun;;
<@348165887347523594>  fuck, i think youve been awake at least 20 hours for now?;;
Yeah, something like that <@207416847019016202> , maybe more actually;;
I had some difficulties focusing on my work this morning;;
If I hang on until tonight it's gonna be a hell of a great night of sleep though;;
I might sleep for an entire day haha;;
when i ended my stream 7 hours age, i was sure that youll be going straight to bed after that;;
and here you are still;;
I'm so tired, my dongle wouldn't work even if I had a back port to plug it in;;
Damn dude sleep still fucked ?;;
Yep, but I think that I'm pushing it a bit though;;
Yeah man take it easy;;
I'ts <@207416847019016202> fault though, his stream started at 3 am and finished by 7 just before I had to start work. You hear that <@207416847019016202> ? It's your god damn fault !!!;;
haha;;
ill be stream 24/7 then, so you wouldnd be able to sleep at all;;
üòÇ;;
Thought you couldn't stream due to your gf being around, but seen you live a lot  <@207416847019016202>;;
haha <@278571432588345345>;;
Is all ok with the missus?;;
all good yeah;;
actually my gf started to go to university recently recently, something like a 8 month learning course;;
computer linqustics;;
and she has classes monday and wendesday 19-22, and saturday 10:30-13:30;;
so they had vacation on holidays;;
and i didnt stream;;
Ho, that's cool, more streams;;
and last days i stream when shes on study;;
Get to those 50 fallowers;;
but we almost came to agreement, so when she will be skipping study, maybe we will make it work;;
üëçüèæ;;
I'm still working to better my connection to twitch. Today it was even better. I've found a good amount of ip's to block and it worked. I was able to watch with little lag.;;
one more thing, i dont have holder for my microphone, so i have to place it on table. and when its close to me, all keyboard and mouse sounds are too loud, so i place my mic further from me. so i have to turn mic sound up, and it picks all the sounds from appartment;;
my table is actually have 2 parts, original and piece of wood that i placed there myself;;
I could hear the fan of you computer indeed;;
so i place mic on other part;;
<@348165887347523594>  yeah, exactly, but maybe it was laptop near, i will not turn it on next time;;
thats good that your connection is getting better everyday <@348165887347523594>;;
I thought I heard you dropping a silent fart also;;
haha;;
üòÖ;;
you are very attentive listener;;
Lmao;;
I lost half my sight, so I gained the same amount in hearing;;
so eye patch not about style? <@348165887347523594>;;
Like daredevil dude;;
Exactly <@278571432588345345>  üòÇ;;
<@207416847019016202> Naa brother, not a style;;
Ya'll want to see pictures of the crash?;;
its good that you didnt gained same amount in scent, otherwise you would smelled farts from the stream <@348165887347523594>;;
<@207416847019016202> hahaha, my life would've been hell hahaha;;
i hope pictures are not too gory? im not afraid but heres many people;;
Naaa, just the cars, I'm not into that kind of stuff;;
haha;;
because i saw some gory shit;;
like you know, you heading from town to town, and at the road theres always some crashes, with bodies;;
not always of course;;
but some time;;
I try never to look at these, or sometimes I get some pretty fucked up videos or pictures on whatsapp. I  get pissed with the people sharing this shit;;
;;
;;
;;
Damn dude;;
You survived some shit;;
;;
;;
Last picture is the car that ran into me;;
<@278571432588345345> yeah some hellish shit;;
Dang... That's crazy Kelly.  Like Jonny said, it's a miracle you survived.;;
yeah, it was your destiny to survive and join this discord <@348165887347523594>;;
Thanks <@342732640815677453> and <@348165887347523594> after a stop at ER and hospital i m better and now able to breathe correctly;;
<@207416847019016202> True that!!! üòÉ;;
<@217089479863697418> Yep;;
I'm so glad to hear that <@502171199850414081> .  Sometimes we need care. I could almost feel your pain reading your message. God bless;;
That's very good to hear Nylllaa!;;
I hate to make people feel sad or uncomfortable about me and illness that‚Äôs why i never know when to talk about it or no;;
Thanks <@217089479863697418> üòä;;
<@502171199850414081> Talking helps. And makes us aware of your distress. And for those who believe, they will pray for you;;
<@348165887347523594> your dongle is bronze dude;;
Damn, I'm so proud of him. Tonight I'll pat him in the back to show him that he can stand straight and proud;;
Chin up dongle!!;;
Lol;;
Just met a legit Nazi;;
Who was 75;;
So I couldn't legally kick the shit out of him. Omg what a racist;;
Shit, where was that?;;
Here in the city I am visiting;;
It's full of German immigrants;;
And he started off seeming nice;;
Then he began to spout his Arian bs;;
Man, I can imagine how uncomfortable and revolting it must have been;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 14!;;
And at that age, it's not even worth the time. It's deep in his blood;;
It's even more fucked up that these people would live in a place where they're in the middle of what they hate;;
i see every anti nazi message get you extra dongle level up;;
thats good;;
"My real name is ""Blessed, Dongle Blessed""";;
Yeah man I got super pissed <@348165887347523594>;;
Yeah man;;
Worst thing is that here in the South of Brazil most people are white, so their racism is embedded as fuck;;
Yeah it is <@207416847019016202>;;
Of course he doesn't represent every German;;
But he pissed me off;;
LMAO <@348165887347523594>;;
in russia we have some hatred for causasians,  because some of them generally very agressive and entitled i would say, but imo generally in russia not much of racism;;
This is good to hear. I have only known Racism when I was living in Florida. I'm not saying that France doesn't have racism but it's well hidden. But you always have these crazy old bastards popping out once a while.;;
Damn.;;
S√£o Paulo also has hidden racism;;
No one openly admits their racist;;
well and to be fair theres not much different races in russia;;
But you can tell if you talk about social matters;;
Yeah <@488734758847905803> same thing;;
what's your stance on special openings for black people in good schools?;;
If the person is racist they just say they're against it and don't even know why;;
what is special openings?;;
I don't know the correct term for it;;
But it's  an opening reserved only for black people;;
<@488734758847905803> They'll try to find all kinds of nonsense excuses;;
So if there are 100 openings;;
10 are specifically for black people;;
I can't remember;;
Yeah <@348165887347523594>;;
Or maybe it's 6%;;
I try to tell people in a single way that it's a social debt;;
There is still lots of healing to do. I'm lucky enough to not have dealt with this but there is one true thing. Every black kid dreams that he was white at a certain point. It got better. But it's that bad. When they make you feel like shit for generations well you feel like shit;;
"i think we dont have this kind of ""segregation"" here, so its not clear for me. isnt having specially reserved places for black people considered as rasism?";;
i mean, why would you even divide it like this?;;
Damn <@348165887347523594>  , I have no idea what that's like and our society is so built that I don't think I ever will fully understand, but I'm so sorry you felt that way;;
<@207416847019016202> No it's not dividing, it's giving more chance to black kids to attend to big schools and higher education;;
<@207416847019016202> , did Russia have slavery?;;
why they dont have chance?;;
Brazil did, and after slavery ended there was nothing to help them work or eat or have a house at all;;
russia had slavery till 1861, but slaves was only russians;;
so we dont have this history with poor other races that dont have chance to education. if we have other races, i would say they are equal;;
Because there is continuous racism here. ;;
51% of our population is black, but over 80% of our main political and entrepreneurial positions are occupied by white people;;
Hm. That's interesting, I didn't know that about Russia;;
I will definitely read more on that;;
russia never had any colonies in africa and such, so we never actually had black people;;
and slaves was our own people;;
<@207416847019016202> It's the same thing in France, racism is muffled since way longer than certain country like U.S, South America and South Africa .;;
Omg my internet here suuuucks;;
And his family is rich to this day;;
But people feel like he earned it;;
That it was clean money;;
I don't know about any black people getting huge amount of lands to do whatever they want with it and getting rich.;;
In these countries <@207416847019016202> black and brown are the poorest ethnicities resulting in centuries of segregation.;;
what's up discorders;;
Omg half my messages didn't go through;;
Hey <@160543395037708288>;;
sup mangooo;;
sup <@160543395037708288>;;
sup kellyy;;
<@488734758847905803> I know your pain hahaha;;
And i dont haha;;
Hi  <@160543395037708288>;;
hey bro;;
scrolling up;;
we diving into politics here orrr;;
No not really lol;;
We try not to delve into politics, but more cultural or social matters. Never politics;;
I'm learning a lot with them;;
everything is politics üòâ;;
let's get philisophical here;;
True true üòÖ;;
And how is canada? I imagine it's a lot like France, muffled racism, not very apparent.;;
canada's a lot to the left;;
Good job <@!160543395037708288>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
they even have some legislation bullshit about calling people by their respective pronouns;;
in legislation;;
Yeah, like I thought, pretty much like France;;
Omg I give up on saying what I was saying ? My internet fuxkinf suuuucks;;
which is ridiculous;;
<@160543395037708288> hahaha;;
like restricting language in legislation is terrabad;;
freedom of speech--;;
Meh. I talked about that in a tweet yesterday;;
The left loses so much in friendly fire;;
ya;;
lmao;;
thats a good way to put it;;
Instead of discussing how to end domestic violence;;
Or some shit;;
They discuss the freaking adjectives that won't offend them and such;;
yeah;;
I think that if a person born a man wants to become a woman;;
Let's call them she;;
And vice versa;;
"If you don't identify with ""binary genders""";;
Fine;;
or try to stop gun laws in the state when like 30k murders happen through gun violence yet 300k people die due to obesity;;
But stop actively LOOKING for a reason to be hurt.;;
It's true, and it gets discouraging. I'm a lefty, but I don't feel represented by those extreme values they're trying to shove in our throats.;;
OH btw dead by daylight free weekend lol;;
We can still have a conversation if I don't know which pronoun to call you by;;
I don't want to offend you , but if you want to be offended it doesn't matter what I say;;
"i mean its fine if you tell me ""i prefer to be called this"" but not when its legislation";;
I am also a leftist;;
LIke that law suit  from the girl scouts against the Boy scouts association;;
I don't even know about that haha;;
Brazil is soooo far from that;;
"Now they're trying to change the name of ""boy scouts"" what the fuck is this about?";;
We still have transexuals and homosexuals being killed by the dozens daily;;
idk i have leftist and rightist traits;;
hows it going fellow dongle danglers;;
cant really identify as one or the other;;
What up <@300033838065778702> ?;;
wassup hardiharhar;;
<@300033838065778702> dangling dongles right here;;
Most my ideals are leftist, but yeah I don't like setting myself in stone like that;;
Because once you do, you can't have a different opinion on anything;;
yeah you're locked in;;
but theres a spectrum;;
nothing much. just trying to catch up on the conversation <@488734758847905803> and <@160543395037708288>;;
<@160543395037708288> I totally not do identify as right though lol. I'm not, that I'm sure. I do have problems with the left. But I got lots with the right.;;
ayy keep the dongle dangling as long as you have it insured üòõ <@348165887347523594>;;
Haha things got philosophical <@300033838065778702> , I was telling the guys that I met a Nazi and that I hate him, that's what it was in a nutshell;;
at this point i have more problems with the extreme left, and im not even white ahah;;
<@300033838065778702> I'm making sure of that haha;;
Extreme anything is bs;;
yeah;;
like one person on twitter was being butthurt on twitter that they took them so long to add a female black person into overwatch;;
ahhh i see. that sounds unsettling to say the least <@488734758847905803>;;
<@160543395037708288> Ho yeah, same here. Well to me, extreme left or right are all the same;;
that type of stuff drives me mad sometimes;;
"But there are people who believe that the extreme left has to ""straighten"" years of deviation of the extreme right";;
Yeah, it was shitty <@300033838065778702>;;
I mean. I honestly don't know how to feel about that in the game tbh;;
Because I'm not black;;
I keep it to left or right. I honestly don't even care about the extremes. Their not on my team.;;
they want every single game to include asian black gay lesbian trans as characters;;
I don't know how I'd feel if most games didn't represent me;;
almost no games represent arab males;;
I tend to try to observe others who are;;
and i dont care lol;;
like at all;;
To learn;;
Hm;;
That's good for my database haha;;
<@160543395037708288> So true;;
Sorry to distract you guys, but  <@488734758847905803> when you 'll be able to, scroll up a little and read my comments about finishing the council;;
theres NO inch of my body that makes me feel like i HAVE to play an arab male or i get triggered;;
Oh cool, will do <@207416847019016202> !;;
make whatever game you want to make with your own vision;;
Thanks for that headsup;;
Yeah, I think I'd feel the same, but again, I'm white and really can't say if that's the case or not;;
Same thing here, I don't give a shit <@160543395037708288> . But again, I don't consider extreme left as left.;;
So that's why I tend to just sit back and listen and learn;;
"yeah basically chillax right? I don't believe in systemic ""white male previlage"" or hate speech";;
stuff like that;;
I hear you <@488734758847905803>  . Well, I'm mixed, which makes me black, and I still tend to just sit down and watch;;
i think everyone's judged by their own personal competence;;
and not by identity;;
I guess, every country has it's own version of politics sides though.  And it's hard to identify itself in one side or the other. What I can be affirmative about is which team I'm not on;;
yeah im mostly talking about canada and the states;;
other countries are extremely more racist;;
like obviously theres some racism here but its like, they havent ACTUALLY seen real racism and sexim until they've seen what other countries go through;;
in this day and age obvi;;
I've haved sat down with people in the U.S who told me some horrible stuff about Afro Americans though. Thinking I was Latin;;
yeah some people can be racist, other people can hate other races too and that's their problem;;
which sucks;;
Yep, humans will always be humans;;
To each his own, at the end, we will be judged individually;;
;;
LOOL;;
nothing got delivered;;
ya i wasnt talking about other countries btw;;
Yeah;;
Shit. Good thing you sent this <@488734758847905803> lol;;
if you're gay in saudi arabia goodluck;;
prison;;
Damn;;
I mean;;
Exactly, the issues are real.;;
Even in the states;;
Because imagine;;
i mean i can name 100 successful famous gay people;;
45 years ago there was segregation in the USA;;
that are well-respected;;
in the west;;
So black people imo did not recover from that 100%;;
As a group;;
Because of course there are successful black people in the USA;;
again i think it depends on the person, theres also a tooonn of successful well-respected black people just cause they grinded like any other successful person out there;;
Honestly, earlier I was saying that I had never felt racism before I went to the U.S...and it is still the only place I'm famillar with that makes such a big deal about skin color <@160543395037708288>;;
Good job <@!160543395037708288>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
its just, there are people who play identity politics, and there are people who do not;;
Yeah the states is tough to discern exactly;;
but theres way more variation between each group then there are between groups;;
It is so bad that when  I'm in the U.S. I'm not only black, I'm a light skin black;;
there are terrible white men, great white men, terrible black people, great black people, you knwo what i mean;;
Yeah of course;;
Gonna have dinner brb;;
same im hangry;;
Gonna sleep me lol;;
I wish we could erase this entire segment from the chat  üòÇ üòÇ;;
Haha nah, it's important to have these conversations, we can't run from them;;
Very true;;
These conversations kill ignorance, because we hear and listen and learn;;
Anyway;;
Have a good night of sleep;;
Remember to do what I told you with your eyebrows;;
And your fingers;;
<@207416847019016202> - so, do you regret playing the council?;;
Or was it worth the experience overall?;;
<@488734758847905803> Yeah, I'm gonna try to hold as long as possible though. See if I can get as tired as possible.;;
True that;;
Maybe more gaming meanwhile haha;;
I've juste finished downloading the latest DMC. I'm thinking about taking a quick break from Wolfenstein 2 and try that;;
DMC is the shit;;
Cool, well then, LETSSS GOOOOOOO!!!;;
Bye the way <@488734758847905803>  <@160543395037708288> , I'd be more than glad to discuss these maters by voice chats more than by texting. It's pretty hard for me to make sense writing in english. At least not yet.  It's hard to make sense when it takes me this much time to phrase something where in the other hand I can talk more fluently.;;
Woooo;;
Yeah same <@348165887347523594>;;
When I go back home on Friday I'd Ben 100% down;;
I'm down for it;;
I did understand you though <@348165887347523594>;;
<@488734758847905803> as i said, game is worth playing, so i dont regret it;;
<@488734758847905803> üòâ;;
go to sleep <@348165887347523594>;;
<@207416847019016202> hahahahahahaha;;
Right. ;;
But not worth a second playthrough;;
Lmao;;
"but you know, when some games like this have some ""moral"" choices, you need to be very invested in all these feelings, or you will just not give a fuck and choose like ""fuck off and die"" <@488734758847905803>";;
Hahahahah;;
Depending on the story I can be invested;;
i honestly dont know how diverse choices of this game, and i will now this only when i will see other playthroughs;;
every story has different parts <@488734758847905803>;;
for example in the end of detroit there was some touching choice on a bus station;;
and i didnt give a fuck because i already failed 1st playthrough, and wanted do good at any cost;;
"and i was like ""you and your family can die, i want best ending for my favourite characters""";;
some similar shit was here;;
like;;
- man, you need to care about these guys;;
- well, i dont;;
- ok, take your worst ending;;
"and for me ""worth second playthrough"" is not exactly a term";;
i almost never replay games;;
You should've stream this so I know what you're talking about;;
"i replayed farenheit and heavy rain and detroit because ""fuck. this game was so awesome, and i just failed, i cant forgive myself, its the best game ever, i need to make it right""";;
Now again I feel like I was raised on a laid back mountain;;
if i ever finish ATOM and if i will have time and if jonny and mango wont stream it yet, i will play it second time and stream it <@348165887347523594>;;
With only my dongle to play with;;
<@207416847019016202> Cool;;
did you played detroit <@348165887347523594> ?;;
With a friend yes;;
And I loved it;;
yeah;;
that game had real choices;;
Then I watched all the alternative scenes and ending on theRadBrad's  channel.;;
well i played 2 times, and my brother rold me his version, and then he watched others and told me their versions, and still i dont know averything;;
Yeah, lots of real choices that mattered;;
you know what really was cool for me;;
for example, you have some location;;
mostly in the end game;;
and you got some huuge choices there;;
and you choose something;;
Yeah with real counterparts;;
and you think - this choice seemed huge. is his choice really matters?;;
and then i asked my brother what choice he did;;
and fuck, he DIDNT even been in that location at all, because of previous choices;;
so he didnt have these choices at all;;
And you're actually genuinely afraid of what your choice will lead to;;
because his story was completely different;;
in some scenes qte had huge impact on story;;
and i suck in ps4 qte;;
because 99% of my life i play xbox360 controller;;
and they has X button in different places;;
I have the same problem, I'm still not use to the ps4 controller. I've only got my very first play station in July;;
i never got one haha;;
we had ps3 and xbox360 with my brother;;
and now my brother has ps4 and xbox one;;
and i just borrow ps4 for exclusives;;
I finally got one because of all the great narrative games it has;;
other from that i dont see a point in consoles for me;;
<@207416847019016202> Yeah, just for exclusives .;;
Well, I've always been a console guys. I started playing on pc like 8 years ago.;;
to be honest, if my brother didnt have one, i would buy console as soon as new Cage game came out;;
because for me its like 100% must have;;
But in 4 years, I probably have played 4 months with my xbox one;;
and i loved beyond: two souls, even if it didnt have big choices;;
<@207416847019016202> Yeah, I understood it's  your kind of games.;;
for me and my brother it was other way around. we got first console in 1993, it was china copy of NES that was very popular in russia at the time, and there was no other consoles in russia at that time..;;
then we got pc in 1997 and from that time we were 100% pc players, till 2011, when we got xbox360 and ps3 (for ff13 and heavy rain);;
but all this time i prefered pc, and for me having powerful pc was a piority (it also helps for work), so since i already got powerful pc (and will have it), theres not much point in consoles for me;;
i understand that gaming pc is more expensive, so many people choose consoles;;
I don't think it ismore expensive but actually the opposite;;
but for me having powerful pc is very important, so its like given that i already have one;;
no;;
gaming pc is at least 1000 bucks;;
and consoles are chaper;;
Well, you get your money back fearly quickly when you consider the amount of games we can get on pc for super cheap;;
for russian steam prices its very true;;
for different countries steam - not so much;;
Here, new console games are on average 89 euros at minimum and it stays at that price for ever . On steam most games I buy never goes over 30 euros;;
what you mean by most games?;;
lets say, AAA game is coming today;;
what it will be cost on steam?;;
I usually never buy a game over 30 euros on games I buy for pc;;
Which means that for about 10 games on consoles I buy can buy a whole lot of pc games;;
well consoles do discounts too;;
but my question stays - what is cost of new AAA game on steam?;;
It's a lot cheaper on the long term considering that I keep a computer for quite a long time;;
Usualy 59 I think;;
and in russia its 30 bucks;;
its like official steam russian fullprice;;
and all steam small games and discounts of course even less;;
This is nice;;
Of course;;
haha remember our talk about 16 times expensive gas;;
yeah, I was thinking about it;;
steam prices is one of the few prices thats nice here;;
yeah;;
and on consoles its 60 here;;
Here is very expensive,  with 13 games you're almost at 1000 euros;;
they do discounts, but steam still much cheaper;;
well again lets not forget that for you 89 euros is still comparatively much less than 60 bucks for russian;;
So for me it is way cheaper than consoles;;
Yeah of course, I'm putting it on scale with steam games here;;
even me, with comratively good salary, i cant imagine buying games for 60;;
I have a shit tone of games on steam. where as very few on  consoles;;
only console game that i bought myself, was horizon zero dawn, but it was with huge discount and costs less that 20;;
no, i lie, maybe with dlc it was 30;;
and without 25;;
I don't understand how Horizon zero's price got so low;;
Here I found it for 15 euros;;
it had some big discount in jule;;
Brand new;;
ok;;
is is bad that i want to ask some of my friends (mostly ppl that use to watch my stream) why they dont watch anymore? they will txt me from time to to time and relay drama thats goes on in their life.. but i just wondered if that would be something to ask them (like a small group that we all use to play games together) just a random question i wanted to bounce off u guys. Big group of them after some drama that happened on stream that wasnt about me at all mainly 2 other ppl that started it..;;
Good job <@!111826600395378688>, your dongle just grew to 2!;;
"my brother didnt want to try this game, so he was like ""would you like me to tell you when this game will have discount so you would buy it?""";;
<@111826600395378688> I would ask;;
i didnt quite understood question, but personally i can watch someone continiously only if this streamer talks a lot;;
<@111826600395378688> Do you have a lots of viewers, or at least enough that speak a lot on your streams?;;
I talk all the time.;;
Yeah but maybe they don't feel like they are not just playing with their buddy anymore;;
If there are to many users talking to you;;
I use to sit around 70-100 switched games down to 20-30 now a Days since one of my mods died and I took a week break like 10-15;;
They use to hang with me when it was big now.. Idk;;
Just drama between a few of them;;
Like ppl getting divorced drama;;
Ho shit, well you have your answer;;
post your link in self promote channel when you ll be live, i want to check it out sometime;;
Been streaming for a few years;;
Kk;;
<@348165887347523594> dont get divorced man;;
<a:peepopoggers:431123559461683206> <a:peepopoggers:431123559461683206> <a:peepopoggers:431123559461683206> <a:peepopoggers:431123559461683206> <a:peepopoggers:431123559461683206>;;
;;
As long as u keep ur dms in your pants... I'm sure u will be fine;;
Separations always break groups of friends;;
<@207416847019016202> I don't even have a girlfriend bro üòÖ;;
And I don't plan on having one anytime sooner;;
thats good;;
I went through 2 bad separations and that's enough;;
Can't deal this shit anymore;;
Oof yea right after high school I caught my fiance of 3 years fucking her bestfriend..;;
Well I proposed like a few months before then..;;
<@111826600395378688> God damn, at my age, that's the kind of thing that would fuck me up real bad;;
<@111826600395378688> It gets worse with age;;
You start going out with the wrong people, spend a lot of money on stupid shit...drink a lot...Naaa I'm so done with this;;
haha i totally understand <@348165887347523594>;;
hahaha;;
Seriouly üòÇ  I've got to the point where letting my dongle dangling  is worth the peace;;
Meh I got a good woman now I trust her with everything;;
;;
Kk eating dinner BRB;;
Lucky you üòÉ;;
but <@348165887347523594> has cool eyepatch;;
who knows what is better;;
hahaha;;
I've made some bad choices in my life;;
My first real girlfriend was supposed to be the one. But after my accident I completely lost it. It's almost like pushed her away;;
haha i had couple of theones too;;
with the first theone we actually still very good friends, for many years, and my gf is friends with her too. but shes in the other city;;
<@207416847019016202> The last one was a total *****. I went on her phone once. Ho my fucking god the things I've seen will forever stay;;
i cant even imagine what these things you are talking of;;
man, it's better you don't know. Cause I had never seen this before;;
Probably in movies;;
"I thought that everyone deserves a chance in life. Well maybe yes but I've learned that ""let this chance for someone else to give""";;
haha;;
"<@111826600395378688> , I would ask as well. Your tone can greatly influence how ""chill"" it sounds";;
yeah i got what you mean <@348165887347523594>;;
people need to be kind to each other, so ill let them be kind, but fuck off from me, thats my motto <@348165887347523594>;;
<@207416847019016202> omg hahahahahaha;;
I'm serious, she did me like she did to everyone else before me, and I knew she was bad. Never again;;
yeah, sadly i experienced something like that one time;;
and i really got you;;
and fuck this shit;;
"Now I laugh about it, you know the ""MAYBE I'M SPECIAL""";;
What a nice family <@111826600395378688> !;;
Tell them we said have a good meal;;
<@488734758847905803> True lovely familly;;
"whats funny, shes still trying once a couple years to connect with me somehow, like pressing ""like"" on my photos from different accounts, i dont know why, and yesterday was exactly such ""once in 2 years occasion""";;
but i really dont give a fuck <@348165887347523594>;;
<@207416847019016202> This is how you protect yourself  destroying your own self and what you got;;
haha well i dont destroy myself ever;;
<@348165887347523594> I've also had really bad relationships;;
Like the worst;;
I have a big heart, and it has not paid off very well, but I trust someday I'll find happiness;;
The one before my wife fucked my best friend from 1st grade;;
We were friends for 15 years man;;
<@488734758847905803> God damn;;
Shit was fucked up;;
me and my gf often talk about many things, and i noticed that i really have many ... i would say systems that defend my self respect and inner stability;;
Type of shit that fucks your soul all the way up <@488734758847905803>;;
<@207416847019016202> Because you're strong;;
My first reaction was to not trust anyone, but in a few days, literally, I thought that it didn't summarize what everyone is like;;
i dont like this word but yeah, kind of <@348165887347523594>;;
<@488734758847905803> Ho I know. All I'm saying is that from now on, I'll listen to the signs. If it's a bad bitch I'm out;;
<@207416847019016202> It's all for the best man. I've been weak all my life. Weak and pretty much people abused of my kindness a lot. Like things that I'm ashamed of.;;
haha im opposite of that, everyone knows that im not too pleasant person, and you will get no kindness for me, so you cant use me <@348165887347523594>;;
After my accident, like a year after, my fianc√© was already gone. I started seeing a girl that I always liked since high school. Well it ended with her taking about 20k euros from me. And willingly  if you see what I mean. I was in pretty bad shape mentally at that time;;
<@207416847019016202> That is good for you;;
good that i never had 20k euros lol;;
but im always generous with my gfs so yeah, sometimes it was a little... i would say that i was used for money;;
but it was not a big money in any meaning;;
<@207416847019016202> Basically, she was always in debts, like everything, and I kept on paying and paying and paying until I noticed that our relation ship was just that. Me paying;;
So yeah, these last 7 years I've only had bad experiences. I'm in no rush to start again;;
yeah thats not so good, i agree <@348165887347523594>;;
and for me everything is good is 5 years already;;
I'm very happy for you. And it should last. My life went south all sudden, and I wasn't able to keep my shit together;;
yeah i had that too;;
so i just moved to moscow lol;;
and everything went up;;
This is part of why I need to move out this island. Seems that it doesn't want to see me leave.;;
I know that is what I need in my life. Move;;
for me it was easier because i always wanted to live in big city;;
I actually do too;;
"and when i was fired, my brother said ""well, we wanted to move to moscow for a long time, lets do it now""";;
and in 3 weeks we lived in moscow;;
and to be clear, its like 9000 km distance;;
It's just that I still have a lot going on here.  And moving alone is not as easy or motivating;;
<@207416847019016202> Yeah that is very far lol;;
i just wanted to clarify so you woudlnt think that its like nearest town in 20 kms;;
In June, I'm gonna try to buy another beach house/appartement. If it works, I'll  be clear and start preparing for a big move;;
<@207416847019016202> Naa I got you don't worry;;
Leaving will mean leaving my company, my clients, all my sources of income;;
And this is a move you have to prepare for.;;
i actually had very close friendship with my boss at a time;;
and i dont think i could just go off;;
but he got fired, and after 10 days i was too, so i was free;;
I understand;;
but i still  kinda asked his permission;;
because we kind of was a... i dont know, like wanted to work together;;
we still actually want, after all these years living in different cities;;
I got you. Well I got a little bit that here with my associate. We do everything together. We made lot of money together. He made me buy the beach house I'm renting right now. And leaving him will mean that for the first time in years I'll have to depend only on me;;
I don't think I have his skills in business;;
yeah;;
for me actually it all went well because i found work while moving to moscow, and basically still work there, and he had to spend a lot of time, searching for work;;
damn, and in the same time cool for you. That's what I'm hoping for. I'm trying to move to Canada. I hope the agency I contacted will be able to find me a decent job. I don't need a highly paid job. I already have those things  going on here. But at least  enough to pay a rent and have  decent living.;;
yeah rent is a bitch here in moscow;;
when you start renting you need to pay 3X more;;
"because 1 part goes for fisrt month, 1 to lanlord ""for safety"", and 1 to agent";;
Yeah, rent is a bitch, cause you aren't acquiring a good, you're just wasting money;;
Hard to go forward when all your money goes every month.;;
some agents take not 100%, but 80 or even 60, but its rare;;
shit;;
but you pay agent of course just once;;
ho, I just realized what time it was. I got to go buy food before the store closes.;;
haha;;
I'll be back  though;;
i heard these weird stories that in europe stores are closed early;;
in russia most of stores closing at 22-23;;
Omg I'm fat...;;
Food coma time;;
"if they closed like in 21, i would be like ""lazy fucks"" <@348165887347523594>";;
Lul;;
Here it closes at 19:30, later;;
"me and my gf actually had a lot of these talks like ""what kind of bad people you need to be, to fucking close your store at 21""";;
I got a walmart around the corner, that shit never closes;;
yeah i got 24/7 supermarket near my house too;;
but all other stores still not closing at least till 21-22;;
"if some store closes at 20, i dont know... it would be like ""why do they exists at all?""";;
<@348165887347523594> - about rent - depending on the situation, rent is better than paying for a house;;
The interest on your mortgage could be higher than if you save money and pay rent;;
Here in Brazil there are a lot of equations to do to see what makes more sense;;
<@207416847019016202> - same here in Brazil for the 3 months renr;;
Rent*;;
yeah;;
but its just for the first month;;
3 times;;
Same;;
and then you pay for 2nd, 3rd and so on;;
yeah;;
Then you get it back at the end, right?;;
Or not?;;
you get back safe deposit, which is one month worth;;
and what you paid to agent, of course you dont get back;;
Here there's another thing you can do: you can ask someone who has a purchased real estate to put as collateral;;
And then you don't have to give 3 months' rent;;
Ohh;;
Here you do get it back;;
"well still its not ""3 months"" here";;
TRUE;;
you pay just 100% for first month;;
then you pay 100% as safe deposit;;
which you will get back;;
not 300%, just 100%;;
I see;;
and then you need to pay agent fee, 60-100%;;
I had understood incorrectly then;;
The person who pays the fee here is the real estate owner;;
Not the tenant;;
and in total you pay 300%, which can be big sum to pay instantly;;
But the tenant (person renting) has to pay 3 months in advance;;
Yeah, it's tough;;
i think that when someone sell appartment, he is paying agent, but i dont remember;;
but with rent its always tenant whos paying;;
usually you got safe deposit back after you moved out, if everything good with appartment;;
but its moscows thing, many other cities doesnt have safe deposit thing;;
just first month and 60-80% agent fee;;
<@488734758847905803> Yeah I guess that you're right depends on the situation;;
Right now, it is better for me to get, if I was to stay here I'd be better off with a house or an apartment of mine. At least, it's yours, and you can do what ever you want with it. Rent it, sell it;;
<@348165887347523594> just installed new patch for ATOM RPG, maybe it got fixed my annoyning bug and i wond be killed so often next time lol;;

For the giggles;;

I had an iguana named Iggy, same uncle who named her though;;
The only animal I named was Maximus;;
My black lab;;
Oh that's a cool name;;
I'm not an animal person;;
No?;;
Why not?;;
My fish even ran away;;
Lmao;;
I don't know tbh, I don't like dogs that jump on you, and maybe I just don't like giving attention to a creature that'd rather lick it's own nuts, than cook me dinner;;
Lmao;;
I like dogs;;
I even have a tattoo of my dog;;

Family Trip Simulator 2019 Brasil Edition <@488734758847905803>;;
building honestly isnt that hard to learn just have to dedicate a few hours in playground only to get better then use what you learn in the actual game! <@!498246547838992414>;;
Good job <@!312379820933906442>, your dongle just grew to 1!;;
<@312379820933906442> Yeah, seems like a good plan, also congrats on your dongle growth;;
<@488734758847905803> A suggestion, rename MEE6 to Dongle Measurer;;
Dongle Master;;

I'm working on a better internet connection. Bonding multiple services. Once this sorted out I may try  <@278571432588345345>. More like  @onemansorange#0414  Small channel;;
<@502171199850414081> good night;;
We're all starting out man;;
I have found that inetfusion does a great job. Right now I'm able to get 5mb/s . I'm still tweaking it a bit.;;
First ones that will know will be here üòÖ;;
<:letsgojonny:536238079434817536>;;
I meant upload. I'm able to bond my three internet accesses now up to 22 mbps.  So expect it will be soon my dudes;;
How are you <@348165887347523594>;;
did you sleep?;;
Yeah bro, from 3 to like 10am;;
thats good;;
That was a long stand though lol. LIke 2 days straight haha;;
I've seen that picture, omg I don't eat pork but it looked so good;;
haha;;
why dont you eat pork?;;
btw i think ill be streaming tomorrow at something like 12.30 pm your time;;
I'm probably gonna be there. I should work on the morning. But I'm always connected.;;
I've been testing inetfusion, and it seems very stable. I've been able to watch streams with very little lag at source resolution today;;
thats very good;;
yep üòâ;;
ive played Kenshi today for the first time;;
"im usually not play all these ""make yout own adventure"" games";;
"and when i started it i was like ""fuck what should i do, theres no quests""";;
but for now i just mining and selling ore;;
I'm not a big fan of these games either. I always say that I need a point A and a point Z. Or I'm not interested at all. I get get very short attention spam when it comes to games;;
yeah;;
im not say im against it;;
id say im against RTS , racing games, and online FPS (against playing it myself i mean) because i 100% undertsand what exactly they are offering, and i just dont like it;;
but with games like kenshi, if i played 20-30 mins, i dont exactly understand what game is offering;;
Me neither. But this is why I stopped playing Skyrim. I fucking loved that game when it came out. Put like +600 hours in it and till this day I pay it high respect. But once I noticed that I could basically do what ever the fuck I wanted to do with no real stakes, my interest just went flat out to point zero.;;
haha;;
<@207416847019016202> I know they are very different games but I hope you see my point;;
yeah i got you;;
well i appreciate when i can do whatever i want, but please give me story too;;
so skyrim ideal example for me;;
take rdr2 for instance. wonderful game, but all i did is story and side quests;;
i didnt do all these side activities;;
like hunting;;
and especially fishing;;
like, if you give me spicific quest maybe ill do it;;
but do it just for a fun of a process... well i dont play games this way;;
fuck i think my last message wasnt deliviered;;
ill repeat 2 messages:;;
like, if you give me spicific quest maybe ill do it;;
but do it just for a fun of a process... well i dont play games this way;;
<@207416847019016202> I haven't finished RDR2 yet, and I'm having a hard time getting back to it. Awesome game. But all the side activities got me distracted. The result was that I craved for a more narrow fun game and now I can't get back to it even though I really want to;;
Discord is probably victim of it's own success. It's been shit these last two weeks;;
haha yeah;;
add more servers you fucks;;
lol, for real though;;
So about Kenshi... as I said, I want to understand what exactly game is offering me  <@348165887347523594>;;
Nd for now I found it;;
I mine ore and sell it;;
And buy food with these money;;
And buy building materials and build shack with it;;
Now it sounds as if it fits or survival game;;
But also game has RPG system, and it's what I like, TES like system - skills you use are upgrading;;
So for now it's okay for me, even without quests - just do some surviving and crafting and leveling up my skills;;
"Also, what interesting about this game, is that in beginning you select some kind of ""set up"", like what exactly game will be - like, you are usual guy, you are trader , you are slave, and depending on your selection you kind of get different type of gameplay, even different genre";;
Some of it closer to RTS I think, some - to RPG;;
I will check out a game play of it, so I get a better idea of what it is;;
As I understand, it will be better to check out some review;;
Because if you'll just watch someone playing, it will be very different from what others could experience  <@348165887347523594>;;
How are you there  <@488734758847905803>;;
I would use your link but I don't use Amazon at all;;
What's up everyone;;
hey <@207416847019016202> - it's all good;;
I'm just trying to make some extra bucks;;
I need to buy a new pc in May, but I got robbed last month so I need to do something extra haha;;
hey <@272988530278662146>;;
what's up dude?;;
just reaching my final stretch of the trip here;;
hey <@272988530278662146> , how are you doing;;
did you played Kenshi, or maybe know something about it <@488734758847905803> ?;;
i did a little overview of my first hour of thise game just a few messages earlier;;
i didnt, nor have i heard of it;;
lemme see;;
haha;;
is it a 3rd person? or is it an overview camera?;;
i heard of rimworld? as i understand games have something in common;;
overview 3d camera with outdated  graphics;;
i only heard of rimworld because of karak;;
hm;;
i heard of rimworld many times, didnt play it either;;
but kenshi got me interested because ive heard about like... different playstyles game can offer you;;
even though its not exactly what i like in games;;
I‚Äôm watching you <@488734758847905803> üëÄ;;
<@207416847019016202> how you liking Kenshi;;
i didnt believe that i could like it, because i stil dont quite understand what is exactly the point of the game (i meant, what it is generally, what can I do here), but for now i just mining and selling ore, and buy building materials, and use it to build couple building for what i will think will be my outpost <@160543395037708288>;;
so far its the only gameplay for me in this game, just survival;;
and i like that skills you use are leveling up;;
ya its more of a make your own story type of game;;
especially when you got beaten up;;
"and i generally never play these ""make your own story"" games, i dont know, maybe i dont have enough imagination, but for now at least its survival RPG that i can enjoy";;
so i will see what game will bring for me later;;
ya i hear you;;
i only played it a little back in early access;;
ive heard of playthroughs when youre for example a slave, and its like totally different game for you;;
ya i read steam reviews that sounded wild;;
thats actually what made me interested;;
like, game has no narrative, but at the same time many kinds of different shit happening;;
did you played rimworld? <@160543395037708288> ;;
i didnt, but as i understand they has something in common;;
never played that one;;
heard about it a lot;;
yeah the same;;
what up homies?;;
Im so close to finishing my book;;
i can fucking TASTE IT;;
dont bite the book <@488734758847905803>;;
too late;;
it's in me;;
how was your weekend overall <@207416847019016202> ?;;
also, @everyone - I will be back to my normal stream-watching self on Friday!;;
be prepared;;
nothing unusual, some streaming, some playing games, some walking <@488734758847905803>;;
cool;;
as you know, ive finished council and started to open Kenshi for myself;;
right;;
i think right word in english is discover, not open;;
in russian its one word;;
oh, i see. But i had understood haha;;
glad youre liking it;;
i still dont know actually;;
for example. there are survival games like Rust;;
and i played it several hours;;
but then i got tired of dying, and generally i dont play those games;;
and what i now do in kenshi (and its not what 100% players do, theres other options i think) - its kinda survival;;
you mine, you craft;;
so judging by my usual susrvival experince, i dont know if it will last for me <@488734758847905803>;;
true, i gotcha. I am not too big on those kinds of games in general either;;
but dont forget that theres one big exception in those games, that you should check out, and its subnautica;;
Hi guys;;
yeah, i bought it because you and jonny said it was so good;;
hey <@465946482474745866>;;
hi <@465946482474745866> , how are you;;
whats up?;;
<@488734758847905803> so me and jonny are each responsible for 50% of money youve spent on subnautica;;
yep;;
thats abotu right;;
if it sucks, i am blaming both of you haha;;
and will send you receipt;;
Am good not much laid in bed stuck on a bit to write got my hero bieng chased by the government and I'm at a blank;;
yeah i feel ya <@465946482474745866> , that writer's block can be a bitch;;
I know why he being chased but to write bits of him on the run is hard;;
dont focus on the details if youre stuck;;
try doing it in general;;
he ran down there;;
he did this;;
he reached the place he had to;;
then go back to it later;;
you'll waste energy that oculd go into writing what you alreadyknow;;
He found out there something worse in the shadows pulling the strings and he is the only one who can stop it and get the traitor to show themself;;
i dont know about writing, but when it comes to programming, if i cant figure out how to do something, or its just doesnt work, i come up with minimum working solution and just go to next thing, to not overthink it, and then return to it later <@465946482474745866> <@488734758847905803>;;
yeah, thats basically what i do when I can. it's good advice <@207416847019016202>;;
My character is the key to winning something the true darkness I named the crucidins;;
you get stressed overthinking;;
They fear what my character is;;
because i know that when you overload your brain with this problem, you becoming too ineffective;;
exactly <@488734758847905803>;;
back to Microsoft Word for me.;;
talk to you guys tomorrow;;
good night <@207416847019016202> and <@465946482474745866>;;
Night;;
night <@488734758847905803> , its 4 am for me, i will be sleep soon too;;
oh damn;;
haha;;
it's only 11pm for me;;
It's 1.13am for me;;
UK <@465946482474745866> ?;;
Yu0;;
Yup;;
coolio;;
Hey, good luck <@488734758847905803> , and good night <@207416847019016202> . I'm struggling here trying to install openvpn tap drivers. That is why I haven't been speaking much;;
damn <@348165887347523594> - good luck to you too then;;
Thanks...I guess you all know the feeling when these things go wrong. I've been struggling with this for hours. Later all;;
what you mean by tap ?;;
i use openvpn to connect to clients sometime;;
yeah;;
<@207416847019016202> I subscribed to  expressvpn but impossible to install the client. Then, I tried to install openvpn to manually connect to the vpn  server. This is where I noticed that the real problem was with the tap driver for the virtual adaptor not being installed.  I get an failed install error when it gets to the tap driver step;;
yeah i got it;;
Looks like this issue is with Windows 10. Has to do with the driver signature enforcement. And basically I don't want to disable this function;;

After nearly 15 hours I'm still weak and can't kill almost nothing lol;;
Mostly I just talk and level up talking;;
Are you still enjoying it?  Or is it getting tedious?;;
I still cant figure out would I enjoy it if I would play it off stream, but on stream it's pretty alright;;
"I'd say that I didn't notice huge problems so I could say ""bad fallout clone""";;
I think it's pretty decent fallout clone üòÇ;;
Will be streaming it in a hour I think;;
Yeah it really looks like they took a lot of inspiration from the old Fallout games;;
A LOT;;
UI is very similar;;
Characteristics is very similar;;
Combat too;;

thanks to everyone who dropped by on my stream, thank you <@300033838065778702> , and infinite thanks to one and only <@348165887347523594>;;
Not a problem <@207416847019016202>  pleasure to be there even though i cant be long;;
yeah;;
too much timezones here haha;;
when one came home from work, another just woke up or go to home or to work;;
Haha. Yeah i know. That is why i try to stream long hours onweekends;;
so far i cant get past 4 hours;;
Longest i did was 10 but i played pubg squads so i didnt realise how fast time goes by;;
haha;;
when i stream i get tired 3 times faster comparing to just playing;;
too much engaging;;
Yes i totally agree. But in my opinion, your interactions are excellent;;
thank you for your kind words, i appreciate that <@300033838065778702>;;
Not a problem at all. You'll be affiliate in no time;;
haha i hope;;
i dont like to stream in 720p a lot;;
You will get there. I am pretty sure üòÄ and why dont you like streamig in 720p?;;
because i want to do 1080;;
but my poor friend here <@348165887347523594> doesnt have enough internet;;
hes from some poor country.... i think it called france;;
Ahh. Streaming 1080p would require some high upload speeds.. I usually stream 720p60;;
i got all the high speeds i need;;
there s no problem for me when i stream 1080p;;
and guys with good connection didnt have problems either;;
i got 200 mbit/s;;
i think i stream 60 fps too, but it doesnt matter for an isometric game;;
Damn. I have a friend in Romania that gets 1GBPS and he pays cheaper than me. I get less than 100 but i am still happy with it;;
Thats true. I stream shooters so the 60p really helps smoothen stream quality;;
well im almost sure that no one in moscow offers more than 200;;
at least in my building;;
otherwise i would have it;;
Usually it is more than enough üòÄ;;
well it won't hurt to have more;;
given the price is reasonable;;
for me now internet is about 10 bucks a month;;
i dont know exactly how much;;
but its something like that;;
Of course. The more the better. And yeah, the internet in your region is wayyyy cheaper;;
well you cant imagine hows everything else is more expensive <@300033838065778702>;;
especially if take into account average salary;;
yeah that makes sense;;
;;
Hey peeps;;
I'm going to gift these bottles to supporters this semester;;
Nice bottles;;
Thx;;
The small ones are Merlots;;
And the big one is a Cabernet Sauvignon;;
Never heard of them;;
I have 4 small ones (even though there are only 3 in the pic);;
1 is for free;;
It's the type of grape;;
O ok;;
i hope bottles are not plastic cases lol <@488734758847905803>;;
looks great by the way;;
They aren't <@207416847019016202> haha they're glass;;

<@498246547838992414> oof not sure if that would work for a 5 year old...  <@488734758847905803>;;
She tried to break out TV earlier.. Decided that today should be a off day for stream..;;
Lmao haha;;
Yeah good decision;;
Hello team mango;;
Been pretty busy these past days. It's one of these bad luck at work passages. Lots of problems hard to fix. But like usual, everything will settle down eventually.;;
Hey <@348165887347523594> , damn dude I know those spells of bad luck at work haha;;
I sometimes get distracted and translate a bunch of shit wrong;;
But yeah, it's all a matter of waiting it out;;
<@488734758847905803> Yeah, we just got to keep faith;;
That‚Äôs awesome;;

Checking out twitch a bit, but it seems that I missed all the good stuff <@488734758847905803>  üòÖ;;
Maybe some gaming I'm not sure. Maybe some DMC, I don't feel like playing Wolfenstein 2 right now. My brain is tired. I wish I hadn't finished Spider Man yet. It would've been the perfect remedy  right now;;
;;

morning;;
Hey <@207416847019016202> , good morning my dude. I guess you're either getting ready to go to work or maybe already gone for work. Have a good day üòâ;;
Haha you're can't be wrong  <@348165887347523594>. I oficially work from 10 am, and I waking up around this time too, so as soon I have woked up, I m ready for work and already going for it;;
I hate autocorrection;;
As a matter of fact, autocorrect on my phone works differently with Russian and english;;
With russian it offers you what it thinks the right word, and only if you press it, it will be corrected. But with english, it automatically corrects what you has written, unless you 'll specifically press word you need;;
So I got used to Russian autocorrect and never press word I need, and always got wrong words when I text from phone in discord;;
Morning everyone.;;
morning <@300033838065778702>;;
how are you today;;
Ayy <@207416847019016202> i am good. How are you today?;;

Yes. I can run some errands today;;

Damn, I just played the hell out of Wolfenstein 2. All night long. It just made my computer crash. I'm going right back to it üòÖ;;
And good morning all;;
morning <@348165887347523594>;;
<@348165887347523594> Good morning;;
Good job <@!498246547838992414>, your dongle just grew to 10!;;
YEET;;
morning <@498246547838992414>;;
how are you <@348165887347523594>;;
Your dongle getting fat  <@498246547838992414>;;
<@348165887347523594> Yeah, I have the 7th biggest dongle now...;;
Good bro, how are you  <@207416847019016202>;;
can any of you guys check out  my twitch channel, i placed schedule there, could you send me screenshot how does it look like for you, and what time there;;
<@498246547838992414> God damn I need to take good care of mine or you'll surpass me;;
<@348165887347523594> Yeah, *watch out*;;
Ok. My computer seems to struggle to restart. I'll check it out once up and running  <@207416847019016202>;;
<@498246547838992414>üòÖ;;
yeah, no rush <@348165887347523594>;;
yesterday i had experimental stream with my gf being whole time in the appartment <@348165887347523594>;;
Ho yeah? üòÖ She wasn't annoyed?;;
"she got tired by the end, when my voice became as she said ""more tired and less enjoyable"" <@348165887347523594>";;
but apart from that it was okay;;
i started stream in this city, and i spent first hour only reading, and fuck, after that i was relly tired;;
I didn't get to see the end of your stream. A client called me before you ended. How long did you stream for?;;
You seemed fine the entire time I watched;;
i think i ended not longer then 20 minutes after your last messages;;
it was something about 3:20;;
Ok, so it lasted more than 3 hours, that is pretty good, especially if you had to work before;;
My computer is finally up and running. It just crashed 4 times, I was about to restore my last back up image lol. It didn't like the entire night playing Wolfenstein apparently. I'm going to check you page;;
To me it looks good. I like the back ground and the police <@207416847019016202>;;
yeah i wanted to check if time is right;;
it is right;;
thanks;;
fuck no its not right;;
its off by one day;;
ill check;;
lol ok ok, well apart from that it looks good;;
It very cool that you've put a schedule too.;;
it is tuesday for you right?;;
Yes;;
You haven't planned on streaming today right?;;
thats what i see, and its the right schedule;;
i planned;;
but on your picture tuesday is empty;;
Alright, so it's Tuesday and not Wednesday;;
exactly;;
maybe ill get another plugin..;;
tomorrow is nylllaa, so i wanted to leave it empty;;
Yeah, good looking out. So it won't conflict true;;
Maybe by the end of next month I'll try to stream just once just to see how it goes. My beach house should be empty for 5 days , if it stays so I may spend these days over there and I have fiber optics over there.;;
can you check it please now <@348165887347523594>;;
No problem;;
thats good that youll be streaming <@348165887347523594>;;
I'm not sure yet. There is still a chance I get clients by then. One thing is sure. I plan on spending at least 2 weeks or the entire month of June there. And then, it's sure I will try.;;
The schedule hasn't refreshed yet, it is still showing the same picture. With Tuesday empty;;
okay so i didnt fixed it;;
Yeah, it is still showing Sunday as first day, and Tuesday empty;;
okay i will try something else for now;;
ok;;
Morning guys;;
What's up?;;
Is <@348165887347523594> gonna be doing some mofucking streaming? Yeah that's what's up!;;
Thanks for leaving it empty for nylllaa <@207416847019016202>;;
You da man;;
I think I might remove myself from the mee6 leveling system;;
It's not really fair haha;;
you mean its not fair that you will loose soon? <@488734758847905803>;;
thats what losers do - removing themselves;;
<@348165887347523594> can you check my page one more time;;
Morning <@488734758847905803> , I'll try maybe end of next month, maybe June. But I'll try the first time it's just gonna be you guys watching. I'm too fucking scared üòÇ üòÇ üòÖ;;
"hahahaha lmao <@207416847019016202> ""that's what losers do...""";;
Wow that plugin is much better and yeah the schedule is fixed and looks Hight mother fucking tech sir;;
haha i know;;
its what everybody use;;
it should be mon tue thu sat;;
Yep, that's what it says;;
good;;
üëçüèæ;;
"I'm gonna have to restore my pc to my last backup image. I'm getting a ""you have to scan your drive for error"". Nope I'm not doing this, it never fixes the errors entirely and I don't want to drag errors on my pc. That crash really did hurt my pc though. But Wolfenstein is well worth it I'm having some real legit fun with it. Anyway I should sleep a bit, (or maybe watch an episode of ""the travelers"" on my surface) .";;
What bothers me every time I restore from an earlier image, it doesn't matter how close the backup was done, Outlook has to redownload all my emails from scratch. Sucks;;
Hahahah <@207416847019016202>;;
I meant that it's not fair cause it is impossible for you to catch up;;
But I guess you want to win the right way;;
BRING IT ORANGE;;
<@348165887347523594> , no need to be nervous dude. It's not as scary as it seems;;
Yeah <@348165887347523594> it never fixes the damned errors;;
Oh damn;;
its not impossible for me haha. you just sit and wait <@488734758847905803>;;
and watch;;
You won't understand when you'll just notice how big my dongle will be one of these days guys. The mango tree itself will stand under the shade of my dongle;;
haha <@348165887347523594>;;
Hshshs;;
Well, Thursday is your chance;;
I'll be driving all day;;
Can your dongle fit in your car  <@488734758847905803>?;;
Lmao!!;;
Looool;;
Windows Spotlight greeted me with another amazing site. https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=oia+greece&form=wsbs01&filters=IsConversation:%22True%22+BTEPKey:%22Encyclo_WL_SantoriniVillageGreece%22&trivia=1&first=1&cw=414&ch=722 I want to go there.  üòç;;

Why;;
$$$$;;
<@498246547838992414> yeah hahaha, I don't want it to shrink;;
Ho yeah lol üòÖ money is a real thing.;;
<@488734758847905803> then maybe <@207416847019016202> will be the almighty donglemaster;;
Perhaps;;
He's gonna have to work hard though;;
I ain't letting go of that dongle throne easily;;
TRUE;;
Work HARD;;
Get it?;;
Jesus;;
That was my best joke ever;;
There's no point in even making new ones;;
<@488734758847905803>üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;
It was good though;;
I've peaked;;
Now I'll only be serious;;
<@488734758847905803> Dead serious;;
Stonecold dead serious;;
You killed the fun lol;;
Hahahaha;;
Lmao;;
Noooo;;
It was to good of a joke, there is no turning back, we have just touched the sky.;;

Pretty good thanks. I m getting sleepy. Played Wolfenstein 2 until my PC spitted its guts. How are you <@312379820933906442>;;
I'm good how are you? <@488734758847905803>;;
Lmao spit its guts <@348165887347523594>;;
I'm good too. ;;
On my last 2 days of the trip now;;
wow thats crazy. i'm great just tired <@348165887347523594>;;
<@488734758847905803>it did lol;;
The damn computer crashed while playing. Then it crashed 4 more times when before I was able to start it;;
sounds like you need an upgrade <@348165887347523594>;;
Maybe, I'm not sure I really pushed it .;;
My eye is getting heavy. Later team mango. I'm gonna hold tight to my dongle and make some dreams about ports and slots;;
talk to you later <@348165887347523594>;;
Good job <@!312379820933906442>, your dongle just grew to 2!;;
Peace out <@348165887347523594>;;
So, <@312379820933906442> , what do you do?;;
Do you work, go to school?;;
both;;
i am almost 20;;
i am a full time student and working about 35 hours a week;;
Holy shit;;
That's time consuming;;
What do you study and where do you work?;;
i'm going for my bachelors in Graphic & Web Design;;
and i work at a local AMF bowling alley;;
It's dang cold here  <@488734758847905803>;;
thats cool <@312379820933906442>;;
i was too lazy and didnt work until i finished university;;
Cool <@312379820933906442> sounds like fun;;
<@207416847019016202> that's awesome;;
Haha;;
i need money lol <@207416847019016202>;;
i actually going to be asking for a raise here shortly. been with the company for about 3 years;;
i got waay to many questions;;
for one, where are you from and what is AMF;;
i am from Virginia Beach, VA;;
AMF is a corporation around the globe. Its a bowling alley;;
its also known as brunswick zones and bowlmor lanes and also Bowlero;;
Do you like the cold <@498246547838992414> ?;;
<@488734758847905803> Better than really hot;;
Oh wow, It's snowing rn;;
we havent seen any snow yet this year;;
however its been super duper cold lately;;
<@312379820933906442> Normally it doesn't snow often here, but it does snow sometimes one year, other years it totally doesn't;;
the past few years we have had a few big snow storms but nothing just yet <@498246547838992414>;;
<@312379820933906442> A little bit of snow is okay, but giant storms are less fun;;
agreed <@498246547838992414>;;
if you studying Graphic & Web Design, why dont you try to find work in this area? <@312379820933906442>;;
oh yea for sure.;;
im still learning;;
but hopefully i try to start finding work here in the next couple of months;;
in my experience learning doesnt do much, until you start practicing <@312379820933906442>;;
i meant practicing by yourself or at work;;
not school projects;;
i am the same way actually <@207416847019016202>;;
i am learning a little bit while doing school projects but not as much as if i can  do other projects outside of school <@207416847019016202>;;
exactly;;
theres also one big misunderstanding;;
some people think that you need REAL project to get some real skills;;
"but ""real"" is not defined by that if you work for company and such";;
even whos gonna use it have not much importance;;
"whats makes project ""real"" - its just that project has some target";;
i mean, if you opened learning web site and completed one task - its not a real project;;
but if you decided to create program or site for yourself, and got into it - its pretty real project;;
because while doing it. youll encounter all kinds of possible problems;;
real problems;;
i feel you <@207416847019016202>;;
my issue is im not exactly a creative person;;
what do you need creativity for?;;
like, ideas for project?;;
if im just trying to do a design for fun or to eventually sell;;
like i want to create random logos just not sure what to create;;
Good job <@!312379820933906442>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
same with websites. I want to start building websites just not sure on what and what route to go;;
well youre right, when youre designer you need more creativity;;
if youre just a programmer, a simple idea will do;;
yea i feel <@207416847019016202>;;
True <@498246547838992414>;;
I also need to ask for a raise tbh;;
Ask  for dat raise;;
like i want to learn on my own as well and create sweet designs or even a nice website;;
It's been 4 years;;
Nice. Do you like drawing at all <@312379820933906442> ?;;
not really into the drawing part. More of creating something like for youtube or twitch <@488734758847905803>;;
Oh cool;;
Panels and such?;;
maybe eventually;;
im still playing around with those myself;;
"i dont know how it will be in english, but in russia for a people like me we have a saying ""hands are growing from the butt""";;
its about drawing skills and such;;
im not sure;;
Lmao what does it mean exactly <@207416847019016202> ?;;
i was trying to figure it out lol @purp <@207416847019016202>;;
<@488734758847905803>;;
it generally means that you re bad at something <@312379820933906442> <@488734758847905803>;;
more often - at something that requires hand skills;;
makes sense;;
lol;;
Morning people;;
but now, when computers came around, this phrase used also about computers;;
hi <@508094590436507668>;;

Exhausted;;
How about you;;
ITS BEEN TOO LONG I NEED A MANGO XD üòâüòâ;;
Working a lot? Haha ;;
I'm good, have been tired as well. Sleeping late and waking up early every day of the trip practically;;
Take a mango then lmao;;
Yes I have been!;;
Hope you get a break soon then and get back to streaming;;
Whats up everyone?;;
Hey <@416803598173995018> !;;
What's up dude?;;
I'm in a museum bathroom taking a dumperoo;;
Sorry for tmi;;
Drank a bit of wine;;
lmao does wine do that to you? haha;;
Not much going on with me, just at work now;;
Haha nah, doesn't make me shit. Just the reason why I mentioned it lmao;;
lmao thats funny. Only thing wine will do to me is give me a headache if its not good wine lol;;
Ah true;;
Do you like wine?;;
I'm raffling one away;;
Love wine! I am spoiled now though after traveling through France the past 2 years lol. I can't really do American wines anymore;;
That's awesome though! How do you enter the raffle?;;
Haha yeah I feel ya. Went to Chile last year and I feel the same lol;;
All you gotta do is follow me on twitch and be in the stream when I do it;;
"Some will be given away if someone does a ""secret condition""";;
Chilean wines are sooo good. I have an affinity for Argentinian wines too. Always love French and Italian wines also. That's cool! Do you have a specific day your'e going to do it?;;
For one of them, yes;;
;;
The big one is a Cabernet Sauvignon;;
And the small ones are Merlots;;
haha that's so cool!!;;
Haha thanks;;
Like both those kinds. Favorite is probably Malbec or some type of red blend;;
I like carmenere;;
Thats my favorite;;
Then I'd say syrah;;
Oh damn, I meant syrah not malbec lol. Im tired today;;
Never had carmenere before;;
Hey  <@416803598173995018>;;
How are u;;
Carmenere only grows in Chile now after a plague hit Europe in the 19th century iirc;;
I wanna hamburger;;
NOW;;
I want a√ßa√≠;;
Da frick?;;
It's a berry;;
Oh...;;
Brazilians freeze its pulp and eat it like ice cream;;
Sounds nice;;
But I still want a hamburger;;
;;
Looks Delish;;
Looks good  <@488734758847905803>;;
It is the best shit ever;;
Hmm... I'm not that into eating poop, but hey, you do you  <@488734758847905803>;;
Hahaha;;
In this country we're proud of eating poop;;
Poopsicles;;
Lol;;
Hey <@207416847019016202> hows it going?;;
<@416803598173995018> its all good, just streamed a little and now preparing for some gaming;;
i actually came up with a streaming schedule, which is huge step for me lol;;
Thats great! Its tough to keep. Ive barely streamed in the past 2 weeks;;
Gotta get back on track;;
yeah i agree, when i stream i lost energy 3 times faster than when i just playing <@416803598173995018>;;
the opposite for me, I can play a game way longer usually if I'm streaming;;
well not exactly opposite, because on stream i at least can play game for several hours <@278571432588345345>;;
and off stream im just too lazy and always switch to something;;
well you said you lose energy 3 times faster - for me its the opposite, I retain energy 3 times more üòÉ;;
haha;;
so with Atom RPG i can definitely say that played this game for 22 hours, because it was on stream;;
if it was 22 hours when game is lainched off stream, it would be like 5 hours playing;;
or less;;
i always get myself distracted;;
<@278571432588345345> - going to cidade baixa;;
A restaurante called Garcia;;
Oh <@207416847019016202> that's awesome!!!;;
I'm glad you made a schedule;;
haha;;
yeah;;
we figured out we can do stream while my gf in the same room;;
Is she going to read?;;
OMG IS SHE GOING TO READ MY BOOK?!;;
Hahaha jk;;
I just like pretending to be super obnoxious and conceited sometimes;;
haha <@488734758847905803>;;
she is not going to read, but shes not very much bothered by several hours of my voice;;
<@488734758847905803> üòÇ;;
oh i see;;
@everyone - got an announcement for you peeps:;;
;;
<@348165887347523594> and <@207416847019016202> are now moderators of the  Mango Tree discord and the Purple Mango twitch channel. If you have any questions about the channel at all you can ask me or them.;;
Maybe i should call them mangorators;;
That‚Äôs awesome well done <@348165887347523594> <@207416847019016202>;;
üòÉ Thanks <@193534318704852993> ;;

Yeah finally, just wrapping it up;;
Today should be relaxed;;
How are you doing buddy?;;

Also, just saw that there was a Demo* for Anthem;;
you just broke my life. switching my color from sweet yellow <@488734758847905803>;;
nice! good to hear.;;
i've been good <@455797717763883009> , today is my last day to enjoy the trip, but I am glad to be going home;;
Read more about it - VIP Demo. Only EA could come up with this shit ü§¶;;
i miss streaming and taking a shower in my shower lol;;
loll VIP demo;;
Lol;;
hate them even more now;;
Nothing beats your own shower;;
and as i understand it really more like BETA, because they said someting about that theres definitely will be bugs;;
"It's just a ""limited"" early access";;
Yo  <@207416847019016202>;;
right?;;
nothing;;
I'm yet to play the RE2 Demo;;
same. by the time i get home, i'd be able to play the actual game lol;;
Haha most probably the same case with me;;
but in a way i dont even want the demo, because i'd only have to play the game again right? or does the progress carry over?;;
I doubt it carries over;;
yeah exactly;;
haha;;
i'm so tired;;
but i can't go back to bed;;
because i'd only sleep for like 30 minutes;;
ugh;;
I hope yall have a good evening. I got to get to work early. Ugh.;;

Awesome. I couldn't remember if you had come back from vacation my days are mashed together;;
yeah i get that feeling a lot;;
what month is this? lol;;
Also my job decides it wants to have a last minute meeting;;
When I go to sleep and wake up it's the same day.. it's a nightmare lol;;
i bet it's a meeting that could easily be done over email;;
damn that sucks;;
Yep. It's only a hour but that's sleep I could have lol. But hope you all have a good one.;;
of course;;
an hour less of sleep is messed up;;
hope you have a good day at work dude!;;
and hope to see you in my friday stream;;

Same man. I should be able to. I dont know what our time difference is, but I'll keep a eye out!;;

Just be ready for fun;;
Haha;;
With the miss you mean <@87241615671832576>;;
Mods*;;

sometimes they are good, other times, embrace;;
haha i think i can block him;;
but maybe its like block notifications for me;;
no, i cant ban or kick <@488734758847905803>;;
Hahahaha true <@87241615671832576>;;
allmighty fucking god;;
but i can kick kelly;;
That's right <@207416847019016202> , vow before me;;
Now*;;
Bow***;;
i think youre forgetting english my dude;;
that what happens when you go deep into brasil;;
when you go to deep into Portuguese you never get out of that forrest xD;;
Which reminds of I love the history of how Brazil came to be üòÑ;;
let me guess. it includes someone lost in the forest? <@87241615671832576>;;
It's autocorrect on my damn phone haha;;
Oh, I didn't know you knew about Brazilian history;;
I follow a channel called: Overly Sarcastic Productions who have made a summarizing of the history of Brazil. I just love the fact that the French tried to fuck up the Portuguese and put a line somewhere they thought no land would be and suddenly there was a small territory and that the Portuguese kind of forgot about their colony in  South America.;;
i only know the big lines;;
I am just fascinated by history in general;;
Hahaha damn I didn't even know about that bit tbh;;
It's so hoooot;;
It's like 33 degrees in this motherfucker;;
Celcius?;;
That's hot;;
Yeah, Celsius;;
Last summer we had round the 38 - 42¬∞C;;
Holy shit;;
Maybe a little less, but close;;
It wasn't livable for me;;
I wanna say a big thanks to @everyone who stopped by my stream today !!! For all the love i received thank you it warms my heart !!!;;
<@502171199850414081> Sorry, I couldn't make it in time, I still had a lot to do for school, from when I was sick, but perhaps maybe next one I'll be free;;

Have a good trip back home then <@488734758847905803> . We can't wait to see you back on twitch üòÉ;;
firking hot;;
Morning everyone!;;
morning bro;;
Ho my god I made this quick break just to say....well, ho my fucking goodness Wolfenstein 2 is INSANE!!!!!! The script is so great, got me tearing up(shit I'm crying again) than got me screaming what the fuck??  and now I'm biting my pillow  to muffle this craziness!! shiiiiiieeet, I'm going back, ho my god I can't calm down...later mangos.;;
That's very good  <@348165887347523594>;;
When bad blood is on sale I will play it, and then go to Wolfenstein 2;;
Or young blood lol;;
And the drive has begun. My father in law wanted to take the first shift so here I am;;
Good luck on the road  <@488734758847905803>;;
Thanks <@207416847019016202>;;
<@488734758847905803> Good luck my man. Drive safely;;
<@207416847019016202> Old blood was very good too man. Man, this saga is getting on my top I don't know what number list. But it's among the top nevertheless;;
yeah i know, you were the one who told me about old blood <@348165887347523594>;;
its in my wishlist now;;
"You won't regret it. And I'm having a blast with ""The New Colossus"".  Dongle straight up kind of fun";;
even if i will regret it, i need to play it before W2;;
Indeed, you must;;
The only real complain I have about this game, and it's the case on all three of'em the auto leaning is broken. But it doesn't break what so ever the immersion or the fun.;;
You'll be streaming in five hours right <@207416847019016202> ? I'll be there. I shouldn't get any call today, and if I do, well, they'll just have to talk to my dongle;;
yeah i will <@348165887347523594>;;
i may be several minutes late or something like that;;
but no more then that;;
to not stream too late, i start my streams at 19.30 ;;
catch is that oficially i work till 19.00, and i need 1 hour to reach home, and 30 mins to get ready <@348165887347523594>;;
so actually i leave work about 17.30-18.00;;
which is totally fine;;
Really lol? You've got a pretty cool job;;
well i said a lot before, that job needs to be done;;
schedule doesnt matter so much;;
if it will be something important i can work from home;;
or even at night;;
and if everything is fine, its okay instead of 10-19 to work 11-18 or something lke that;;
Yeah I understand. A bit the same thing for me. When something has get done, I do what ever it takes to get it done. On site or at home. Once it is done, I can take a break or move on to something else;;
yeah exactly;;
its kinda IT motto;;
nobody cares if you are busy when something broken;;
but also nobody cares what you do while theres no work;;
Morning mangos!;;
Does your dongle hang low, does it wobble to and fro, can you tie it in a knot, can you tie it in a bow?;;
Hahaha morning  <@287320205020102667> !;;
Good morning! üòÉ;;
Nice poem <@287320205020102667> haha;;
Taking a break from driving now;;
;;
<@502171199850414081> Exactly me this morning;;
Yeah this feeling is meeehh;;
Trying to find the strength to see if I stream or no;;
But probably better rest and do it tomorrow... i am back with back and kidney pain;;
i love thursdays though lowkey hehe;;
Alright I guess it‚Äôs my time to go to bed !! Have a wonderful end of day @everyone;;
<@502171199850414081> üòÇ  I love that sticker lol;;
good night <@502171199850414081>;;
hahahaha <@287320205020102667>  30 minutes ago it was hanging low, but I slowly feel that I should tie it to a bow üòÇ üòÖ;;
Lol üòÇ <@348165887347523594>;;
Hey @everyone;;
Hey guys;;
Yeah <@160543395037708288> I like Thursdays too;;
Good night <@502171199850414081>;;
We hit some bad traffic and added 2 hours to our drive;;
Sad trombone;;
But my father in law let me choose the tunes so that's cool;;
Nice;;
<@488734758847905803> Listen to some beachboys;;
<@488734758847905803> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_tMBBuIwlo;;
<@488734758847905803> Thursdays are horrible;;
I'm not a big fan of the beach boys <@348165887347523594>;;

YOU DON'T LIKE GYM?!;;
No;;
Why? Haha;;
<@488734758847905803> Yes we can, for ever and ever and ever and ever and ever;;
Well... gym is just horrible here, we need to dance for fricc sake;;
Also I very much dislike exercise;;
Nice <@348165887347523594> <:PurpleMMMANGO:499310401465352197> <:PurpleMMMANGO:499310401465352197>;;
Oh, dancing sucks;;
Here in Brazil guess what we do in gym class?;;
<@488734758847905803> The Cha Cha?;;
No what's the name of that gym dance again?;;
<@348165887347523594> We needed to do some crappy hip-hop dance;;
Football haha;;
hahaha;;
Every time it was just football;;
I wasn't too bad myself;;
But you know, competition is brutal;;
<@488734758847905803> Oh, It's big in Belgium as well, but it's not a big thing in gym class;;
Maybe if I had lived somewhere else I could have gone pro;;
Ah I see;;
<@488734758847905803> I thought you were going to say ZUMBA hahahaha;;
With the best team in the world coming from Belgium;;
The Red Devils;;
Lmao <@348165887347523594>;;
Fite me hat0rzz;;
Lol Palmeiras is #1;;
<@498246547838992414> Belgium is like our favorite adversary. But I guess you know that;;
<@488734758847905803> Okay, if you say so... Not to big into soccer myself, but I did play it a bit when I was younger;;
<@348165887347523594> Wut?;;
Haha check them out later <@498246547838992414>;;
<@488734758847905803> Sure;;
France loves the Belgium and Suisse football teams. We respect them.;;
Really, I didn't know that;;
You didn't? How come?;;
I don't really follow the soccer;;
Ok lol;;
Well, we consider Belgium and Suisse like brother countries (or sister countries depends how you put  it);;
It's always  a pleasure to confront these teams;;
But I'd say that the best individual skilled players are coming from Brazil <@488734758847905803>;;
Belgium is kinda a midget, don't you think? but we did kick ass last world cup;;
yeah, <@488734758847905803> 's ass got kicked;;
<@498246547838992414> Belgium always kicks ass when it comes to soccer;;
<@348165887347523594> Yeah, well France isn't to bad as well;;
Haha, France, is right now on top of the world hahaha when it comes to soccer. And we are very proud of that üòÉ;;
But things change fast;;
You should, It's a great sport;;
True also;;
üòâ;;
<@488734758847905803> should play for Brasil, and they'd be on top in a heartbeat;;
And we don't think as Belgium as a kind of midget. We really consider it as the sister of France (or brother lol);;
Well, yeah I mean half the country speaks French;;
And we share a border;;
A very friendly border;;
<@488734758847905803> I need help with a discord that I‚Äôm mod in;;
<@348165887347523594> that's true;;
I've never actually been on vacation in France itself, only passed through it;;
France and Belgium relationship just upgraded +100;;
Lmao  <@207416847019016202>;;
<@348165887347523594> , lately I disagree. Ever since Ronaldinho and Ronaldo;;
Neymar sucks, I hate him so much lol;;
Hahahaha I wish <@498246547838992414> ;;
I actually did some tryouts;;
But didn't pass;;
What do you need <@448648678224429068> M;;
?*;;
Lol <@207416847019016202> haha;;
Yeah we did get our asses kicked;;
russia got kicked from cup one day later than brasil. for us it was like... wow <@488734758847905803>;;
Haha but you guys went far as hell, I was impressed;;
I was rooting for you guys then for Croatia;;
After Brazil got knocked out;;
;;
yeah;;
welcome <@314733038854602752>;;
Hello ‚ô°;;
<@488734758847905803> please show <@314733038854602752> your love;;
Purplemango invited me via twitter üòÑ;;
twitter is not enough;;
the real love is here;;
but it was little more silent these days, because king himself is on the road;;
Yeah, I suggested getting an audible free trial so that he could listen to books. üòÉ;;
Instead of just music;;
JUST music;;
how can you;;
‚ò∫;;
I got it thanks anyways <@488734758847905803>;;
something with my connection or with discord...;;
couple of my messages are red;;
i thought red messages is mangos privilege;;
<@314733038854602752>;;
It just means they didn't send. üòÉ;;
i understand;;
but i dont have this problem usually;;
and mango has it a lot;;
given hes somewhere in the jungle;;
I can see that, I get it a lot too in my house where the wifi is iffy;;
Good job <@!314733038854602752>, your dongle just grew to 1!;;
I used to do 1900+ mile road trips... So there wasn't always enough music on my phone for dead zones and I'd just get tired of it because I'd been listening for 10 hours straight.;;
So I always had 2-3 good books;;
yeah;;
theres always enough music for me;;
and if i read (which i dont do a lot), i read with my eyes;;
so oldfashioned;;
I love to read but I'm finding it harder to find free time to just sit and read so I listen when I go for walks, chores, everything;;
yeah i understand <@314733038854602752>;;
in such moments i listen to youtube;;
I listen/watch youtube when I'm folding clothes or working on the computer because I want to have some focus on the books.;;
I'm thinking of starting a reading channel but I don't know what I'd read yet... I'm not sure I have a voice for horror;;
yeah, at work im trying to listen as much as i can, when no one distracts me;;
what is reading channel? like youtube channel where you read?;;
Yeah, a lot of them are horror stories;;
Look up corpse husband, he's a popular reading channel;;
done;;
got it;;
i listen to comic reading channels sometime;;
Nice;;
WELCOME <@314733038854602752>  under the shade of the purple mango tree....Get ready cause your dongle will grow fast;;

No sleep yet...But not sleepy;;
"I just read you message ""France and Belgium just upgraded relationship +100"" üòÇ üòÇ  you're too much man";;

Sorry it took so long to greet you;;
Just got home now and I have to work now haha;;
Hope you had a good day/night;;
Lmao <@207416847019016202> , I only have issues when it's on my phone;;
Where do you live <@314733038854602752> ? Which country I mean, don't tell us your actual address of course haha;;
Oh cool. I'd watch a reading channel;;
Thanks for the welcome wagon <@348165887347523594> and <@207416847019016202> , you guys are amazing;;
USA üòÉ;;

I'm originally from NJ;;
<@488734758847905803> You have shown us the path to greatness ho great mango king. The sweet taste of mango shall spread.;;
Nice;;
Hahahahah damn <@348165887347523594>;;
Omg that was the longest trip of my liiiiife;;
In one shot at least;;
17hours;;
So <@314733038854602752> ,what games do you like to play / watch others play?;;
Damn, yeah 17 hours is a pretty long road trip, like very long;;
Yeah haha;;
Feels good to be home;;
Now I have to work, shower then sleep;;
Cause tomorrow is a streaming day! Woooo;;
I work a lot so usually when I have twitch on it's just lurking... I play a lot of casual games, I play FO76, Sims 4, whatever feels good at the time. I just bought Cultist Simulator so I am thinking of playing that later, but I have too many video games to know what to play. o.o;;
Good job <@!314733038854602752>, your dongle just grew to 2!;;
Oh true. What do you do for work?;;
Yeah I'm the same haha. I have way too many games for my own good;;
I do customer service. üòÑ;;
Ditto just on the PC I have almost 1500;;
Damn haha;;
Oh do you like it?;;
It's a job;;
I don't know many people who love everything about their job, but customer service has it's happy moments and frustrating. üòÑ;;
yeah, loving everything about your job can be tough depending;;
I like my job a lot since i get to work from hom;;
home*;;
What do you do?;;
He's interpreter from Portuguese to English  @SkyeSnark#306;;
Morning everyone;;
Never heard of Cultist Simulator haha;;
For some reason quote didn't work  <@314733038854602752>;;
No worries, I ended up not playing. XD;;
I did gems of war to do weekly guild requirements;;
Never heard of it too üòÇ;;
I do daily quests in TES Legends every day;;
"But on that my list of ""repetative"" games ends";;
It's a match three game that has the combat element too;;
My phone games are gems of war (on steam too), love nikki, and picture cross;;
I don't play on phones, but if I do, it's usually games that has 100% exact representation on other platforms, like TES Legends, Hearthstone or Baldurs gate;;
Nod nod;;
For example, enhanced editions of Baldur gate 1 and 2, and Planescape Torment are present on android, and it's the same games, and even saves work between steam and android;;
I consider these as not mobile games;;
That's why I like gems of war;;
Even if I play it on phone;;
I have nox so I can play my phone games on my pc;;
But I use picture cross as my main distraction;;
sorry, didnt get the last one <@314733038854602752>;;
what is picture cross?;;
It's a puzzle game;;
ah okey;;
;;
"its nice to have someone here who dropped 5 unknown games names in 5 hours, and didnt say anything like ""RE2 guy, cant wait!""";;
or Anthem;;
it looks like sudoku <@314733038854602752>;;
XD;;
Yeah, it is kinda but I like it better than sudoku;;
I'm poor, I couldnt afford RE2 and I'm old so i played it on the playstation when it came out. :x;;
Good job <@!314733038854602752>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;

sorry I couldnt hang out more;;
but I had you on the background;;
how do you become streamer of the week?!;;
I'm glad you asked <@312379820933906442>;;
Every month the mango council and I vote on 4 streamers to be the streamers of the week.;;
We base ourselves on who was the most present in chat here in discord, who supports others' streamers in here;;
sweet!;;
you can check more info in <#525283886037467137>;;
there's a pinned message;;
got it!;;
nice :);;
;;
also, those who are in the mango council won't be streamers of the week, but it will be a rotative role, so once they leave the mango council, they will have a lot of points to be streamer of the week;;
and then we'll get new mango council people;;
sounds good to me!;;
i need to get to level 5 üòâ;;
haha gotta grow that dongel;;

hahaha;;
I can't believe i missed that lol;;
I'll just say one thing about Resi2 <@278571432588345345> and <@160543395037708288> - the word dongle appears in the game haha;;
I couldn't even believe it;;
<@488734758847905803> how much are you loving RE2?;;

You know what I think really made the stream great abssii?;;
that you included us in all your decisions hahaha;;

"LOL ""should i cancel on stacey""";;
i guess im canceling on stacy BOYS;;
sorry cant make it tonight BOOSH;;

i mean im 100% sure im never seeing her again LOL;;
i'll be there at 9:15;;
oh wait mango raided me;;
damn.;;
I'm doing leon's first <@217089479863697418> ;;
did you play on normal or hardcore?;;
hahahhahahaa;;
Normal;;
can't make it, raid just happened;;
i might do that one in hardcore just cause we can actually aim in that one LOL;;
same <@217089479863697418> - i tried playing hardcore for 30 minutes and was like nop;;
nope*;;
i COULDNT handle RE1 on the hard atleast not at the start;;
<@160543395037708288> , it's insane. I promise you;;
I just don't enjoy insane challenges on my first playthrough;;
it's impossible;;
especially playing chris first without playing any other real RE lmao;;
Good job <@!160543395037708288>, your dongle just grew to 5!;;
omg lol, he just has a knife at the start, right?;;
yeah i mean you find a gun early but, without knowing the mechanics of the game it just played differently from all recent games;;
true true;;
I know what you mean <@217089479863697418>;;
I innocently thought I could do it lmao;;
chris did have more crit though;;
but fuck me 6 inventory space;;
you guys doing it with kb+m or controller?;;
<@160543395037708288> it's crazy how much easier it is though on your second playthrough.  I'm replaying it at Chris and already half way through.;;
On RE2?  I'm went mouse and keyboard.;;
<@217089479863697418> yeah once you know everything i can for sure replay it on hard with chris;;
but goddamn does figuring all that shit out feel good;;
yeah im excited to actually AIM in re2 haha;;
<@160543395037708288> i'm on ps4;;
The controls feel really tight in RE2;;
I agree <@217089479863697418>;;
I'm garbage at aiming with a controller... lol;;
i'm trash at aiming with the mouse haha;;
but i hope FF7 gets even half of the quality of RE2;;
Good job <@!488734758847905803>, your dongle just grew to 23!;;
capcom did an amazing job;;
Yeah the detail is just amazing;;
yeah.;;
the water texture on the ps4 sometimes looks horrible;;

Sleep lol, currently looking for a job but nothing has come thru yet. So I spend most of my time supporting people, it‚Äôs the one thing I love to do!;;
nice !;;
do you have a specific field you're looking for?;;
real heroes dont wear capes;;
Well I‚Äôm use to doing labor jobs. But I‚Äôve been trying to self teach myself web development. But currently looking for either kennel tech jobs or mail delivery. I was a seasonal ups deliver this last year. ;;
And that‚Äôs so nice of you to say!üíú;;
oh i see. wow, web development is tough, you must be a genius;;
(not being ironic, just to clarify);;
"using ""genius"" on the internet can sound sarcastic or ironic haha";;
do you live in the US?;;
Haha I wish I was a genius but the way I see it everyone is a genius in their own way! and it is tough. But I love to learn new things. And yes I do. Do you live in the US?;;
I am originally from the US;;
but i live in brazil now;;
and that's interesting that you think that;;
<@207416847019016202> is most certainly not a genius at least haha;;
i'm just kidding dude;;
haha;;
i most certainly not;;
but im not WEB developer;;
front end is beyond me;;
Oh wow what‚Äôs it like there!? And I live in Texas born here raised here until I was 12 then moved to Missouri. Now living back in Texas as of March 2018. <@488734758847905803> and <@207416847019016202> web development is tough but once I teach myself that I plan on teaching myself web design as well;;
Brazil is cool to meet people and sstuff, but not to live at the moment imo;;
everything is expensive and it's getting increasingly dangerosu;;
dangerous*;;
I live in Sao Paulo to be more accurate;;
4th biggest city iirc;;
brazil is cool to meet people, but some of those people could kill you (C) <@488734758847905803>;;
I‚Äôve always wanted to travel to Brazil. I love to travel, I don‚Äôt know if I would ever actually move to another country but I wouldn‚Äôt mind visiting other countries.;;

its in 16 hours i think;;
from now i mean;;
youre very welcome to join;;
i will post it as usual in live now channel;;
it will be Atom RPG;;
I will definitely keep a look out for the post so I can come chat and support you! <@207416847019016202>;;
yeah, ill make it loud announcement haha;;
HahaüòÇ;;
i have this problem... or question, i dont know ;;
for now i like to stream game that has a lot of dialogues, and what i do is basically read a lot;;
and when somebody listening silently its ok;;
but when somebody is actively chatting, i love it very much;;
<@207416847019016202> - tomorrow or monday;;
and i start to chat;;
thanks <@287320205020102667> - my wife made it üòÉ;;
hm;;
and i cant chat and read game at the same moment;;
so either i stop playying and chat, or i dont read and just play;;
dilemma for me;;
my  suggestion: <@207416847019016202> ;;
;;
whenever there is dialogue;;
"you can say ""One sec, I will read this then catch up with chat""";;
problem is, in city locations 90% of game is dialogue;;
i speak about Arome at the moment;;
but it can be a problem for many games;;
you can pause sometimes and talk to them;;
exactly;;
thats what i do;;
and it bothers me lol;;
<@488734758847905803>  monday is my scheduled normal stream, and tomorrow ill just check if i want to stream both on saturday and sunday, thats why i didnt put it on my twicth chedule;;
and i didnt decided on tomorrows time yet, so another reason not to put it in schedule;;
sorry <@488734758847905803>;;
i thought you asked about my stream;;
nah it's ok;;
now i got it;;
im not so stupid;;
just a little;;
hahaah;;
but good to know your schedule;;
I kinda came into this convo last minute but when I have that problem, I put subtitles on my game <@207416847019016202> just so if I have to answer something quick that I don‚Äôt want to wait till the dialogue is over to do so, and those viewing can still be able to keep up with the story if that‚Äôs what they are interested in.. idk haha;;
thats good advice <@510594499202908160>;;
problem is, now i play the game with a lot of text, that no viewer in the right mind should not read lol;;
and reading this text is most of my streams;;
and im not answer quick, i just start telling fucking stories lol;;
poor <@488734758847905803> today got to know all my moscow random encounter stories;;
Ohhh i see. Haha I do that too sometimes üòÇüòÇ;;
anyway glad to hear you <@510594499202908160>;;
didnt lurk on your streams for a while;;
Oh it‚Äôs okay I‚Äôm glad I could put my input out there. And no worries it‚Äôs totally okay;;
Good job <@!510594499202908160>, your dongle just grew to 2!;;
I could put my input sounds awesome <@510594499202908160>;;

Nah;;
in all belgium?;;
or in your building?;;
We do have it here, but it's crazy expensive;;
yeah its one of a really FEW things that relatively cheap in russia - internet and phone prices;;
i pay 10 bucks for unlimited 200 mbit/s;;
My god;;
I'm moving to Russia;;
but i can assure you, over all salaries and prices would make you kill yourself;;
i mean, if i will start list to you salaries;;
and prices;;
its fucking worse than europe;;
much worse;;
That's not good;;
Here we make a lot, but pay a lot;;
and we make a little and pay almost the same;;
So it balances out pretty evenly for the most part;;
for example, we discussed with callison, he bought capture card for 125, and here its 500;;
but here people make much less than in US;;
and we discussed with changeover that gas here is 4 times expensive;;
and still, salaries kinda 4 times lesser;;
so its 4*4 = 16 times worse actually haha;;
so buy your expensive unlim and dont go to russia;;
Okay, maybe on holiday or so, but it sounds bad to live and work there;;
haha;;
depends on job of course;;
i love it here;;
and people are always adapt;;
Here it's not bad, but not the best, because you make good money, but there are taxes on everything, and gas is costs than twice the price in germany or in the netherlands;;
i bet you that here gas is more expensive <@498246547838992414>;;
Good to know I'm no the only one having issues downloading it <@207416847019016202>;;
Probably <@207416847019016202>;;
I know people that go to germany for groceries here;;
and we got only 13% taxes on your income, but we got some taxes that are included in cost of goods, so its the same;;
I don't know the percentages here, but you pay a lot of different things;;
well theres no point talking about prices or taxes, only thing matter is how much you can buy for your money;;
we can take any item, for example loaf of bred;;
and just calculate, how much loafs of bread people can buy;;
and it will be like 200 in europe and 50 in russia;;
That's a big difference;;
i mean how much people can buy for their monthly income;;
thats exactly what im talking about;;
and im sure its not 4 times;;
its way more;;
That's bad;;
as i said, everyone adapt;;
you judge by level that you used to;;
Yeah, that's true;;
if it was worse for you, you would think the same about countries that has it even worse;;
and fuck theres a lot countries with lot worse situation than russia;;
Yeah, that's also true;;
Belgium has a good social system and all, but still not really great;;
Healthcare is sweet here though;;
we got free health care system;;
of course it kinda very bad;;
Here it's not completely free, but the government pays you a percentage back;;
Good job <@!498246547838992414>, your dongle just grew to 11!;;
but in some cases its way better to go to free doctor, than pay a lot to private clinic doctor, who will tell you the same;;
sup sup;;
Sup <@160543395037708288>;;
we got 100% free goverment clinics, and we got A LOT of privates <@498246547838992414>;;
hey hey <@160543395037708288>;;
hows your day;;
pretty good how you guys doing;;
im not impressed with anthem üò¶;;
well im personally wasnt interesting in it from the start, so thats okay for me üòÄ;;
a liked bioware old games a fucking lot;;
and i even liked dragon age 3;;
it all has ended with Andromeda;;
i finished it but wasnt overall impressed;;
and when i found  out that they making game that not concentrated on story, i realised that its time to let go <@160543395037708288>;;
same with call of duty;;
i looved story in CoD games;;
yeaaah. it was just very lackluster aside from combat and movement;;
Yeah I‚Äôve watched people play anthem and it looks lame tbh. Weren‚Äôt you playing it yesterday <@160543395037708288>;;
ya lol its scuffed;;

hey <@510594499202908160>;;
what were ya playing today?;;
Ya know, I think they got the janitor to give me the syringe yesterday, I feel like I've been hit in the shoulder with a sledgehammer;;
damn dude;;
is there a bruise;;
?;;
No, but it's not normal It hurts this much;;
I couldn't move my arm properly this morning, and today when I was at the shop, I could barely cross my arms;;

Lol. Late to the game again;;
<@314733038854602752> - everyone has a life story, and they are all interesting;;
:);;
If you want to tell yours, i'd love ot hear it;;
yeah <@456226577798135808> haha;;
how have you been dude? i haven't seen ya in a while;;
Life story, man that would take a long long long time. Haha;;
I‚Äôve been good. Just busy as fuck;;
haha;;
well, we can always do repeats lol;;
oh good to hear that youre well;;
work?;;
i have been busy with work ever since i got back from my trip;;
Been dealing with car dealer fucking up my car;;
doing soccer transaltions;;
oh damn;;
So this past week has been a pain in the ass.;;
Yea, new car too;;
what happened?;;
<@488734758847905803> can I tell you how much I don‚Äôt like streamers on my interview;;
sure <@448648678224429068> haha;;
Long story short, bought new car last year, took in for 1st oil change, they forgot to tighten oil drain plug. Car got fucked up. Dealer keeps fucking up and now I have a new new car and they fucked that up too;;
Can‚Äôt go into specifics. It‚Äôs so serious I had to sign an NDA.;;
you can say whatever you want as long as it's not racist, homophobic or generally disrespectful to any religion or belief;;
omg <@456226577798135808>;;
Yea;;
an NDA so they don't ruin their reputation?;;
When a major corporation has you sign an NDA for something like this u know it‚Äôs serious;;
It won‚Äôt be any thing like that just how bad I can‚Äôt stand streamers bwahahahah;;
Good job <@!448648678224429068>, your dongle just grew to 14!;;
NDA so I can disclose what they did to make the situation right;;
so you can't disclose?;;
or so you can?;;
I‚Äôll leave it at that.;;
No I can‚Äôt;;
hahaha sure then <@448648678224429068>;;
ah ok;;
no probs then;;
dont get into trouble because of us;;
I can say the dealer fucked up that bad and the corporation has been working to get it resolved.;;
My jokes aren‚Äôt very funny;;
So yea. Mess of a week.;;
Anyway. RE2 has been fun;;
sounds like a perfect recipe for a headache;;
RE2!!!;;
shit scared the shit out of me haha;;
Loving it;;
I think they are <@448648678224429068> haha;;
dont seel yourself short dude;;
sell*;;
Kinda pissed because OBS, c920 and my computer are no playing nicely to stream. So it‚Äôs back to streaming from the console. Sigh;;
I think the PC side of things just can‚Äôt keep up. I have 25mbps up, so that‚Äôs not the issue. I think the c920 puts to much of a load on the system;;
Hopefully within the next few weeks I will have my new laptop to use obs;;
Cool;;
I need a new pc but fuck are they expensive;;
hm.;;
do you have a capture card <@456226577798135808> ?;;
running a stream and the game takes a lot out of a pc;;
I am suppose to be getting one built if I can ever get my stream big enough;;
a pc <@448648678224429068> ?;;
nice;;
Yep it‚Äôs going to be sweet when it‚Äôs done;;
"when someone from ""not poor"" country says something like ""pc is expensive"" i think fuck my ass";;
Lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
back me up on this bro <@488734758847905803>;;
hahah yeah <@207416847019016202>;;
You gotta give a kidney and a liver to get half a pc here;;
You have to give your entire body for one here;;
hahaha;;
here is pc costs more than 1000, with most people making 500 a month;;
For my pc to be built it‚Äôs going to cost $2800.00;;
damn.;;
;;
I'm sure that pc would cost like... 15k here in brazil lmao;;
probably doesnt even exist;;
I am so behind in my discord chats lol.;;
Hello <@342732640815677453>;;
That interview idea sounds awesome! <@488734758847905803>;;
Lol well if I have it built the best way that‚Äôs what it will cost if I go the other way it will save me $1000;;
<@498246547838992414> !!! Hey bud;;
I like consoles but damn is a PC nice. <@448648678224429068> You will love it. It sucks that not everyone has the best/inexpensive access to one.;;
I will have one just gotta grow my stream more to work on that goal <@342732640815677453>;;
<@448648678224429068> I feel that. Hope it is going and continues to go well. I will try to stop by!;;
My streams have been getting bigger just not the type so support that helps like I get the viewers just no one chatting or anything;;
Try different ways and techniques to get people chatting. Do like trivia questions or act goofy and silly;;
I‚Äôve tried that. I only have a hand full of people that will actually chat in my channel;;
Like I‚Äôm almost to the point of leaving Team Rise because none of them even try to stop by except for my squad leader she is the only one;;
I know the feeling too much <@448648678224429068> still can‚Äôt give VIP role in my channel because i still need 5 people to talk in same time... only got 4 !! And i have 94 followers;;
Yeah it sucks;;
So i have ended up thinking the problem was surely me;;
Nah it‚Äôs not you it just takes time i went 2 months at .5 viewer average and I‚Äôm not at 4.0 for the first time since becoming affiliate;;
I can give vip to people just need the vip diamonds or whatever;;
<@488734758847905803> It's a really interesting concept, the interview thing;;
@everybody have you heard of twickle;;
@everyone;;
No <@448648678224429068>;;
What is it?;;
I didn't  <@448648678224429068>;;
You can connect it with your twitch account and people can use the invite link to get points and they can invite others and get points off of that as well to help with giveaways and promote your stream;;
Oh? I'll look into it;;
There is actually an extension on twitch that you can install and configure and then it will put there bot in your channel and they will post the link while your live it has helped me get viewers big time;;
I use MEE6 in my discord for that;;
This is straight on your twitch they even put your code out for others outside of your discord‚Äôs;;
Oh wow;;
I‚Äôve had people raid me that I have never even seen out of all of my discord‚Äôs;;
<@488734758847905803> I do. I have an Elgato HD60;;
Good job <@456226577798135808>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;

Nice! <@416803598173995018> ;;
;;
I personally prefer story games. So I'd vote for those instead of destiny and black ops;;
I'd vote for last of us, rdr2 and maybe spiderman;;
I chose games that I don't hate and that I already played;;
Lmao;;
games that I don't hate;;
Awesome! Thanks <@207416847019016202> and <@488734758847905803>. Looks like I will do last of us 2 and red dead each one of the days;;
Thank you  <@416803598173995018>;;
I really hate games that don't have single  <@488734758847905803>;;
And the rest of the list I didn't play yet;;
I dont like games without stories either <@207416847019016202>;;
except FIFA;;
man i was good at that game;;
Titanfall 2 has a really, really good single player campaign;;
I suck at FIFA lol just like I suck at real life football;;
I like all types of games. I get in moods where I love shooters and then go to campaign/story types of games;;
Yeah I heard about titanfall 2 so I won't watch streams, and will play it myself  <@416803598173995018>;;
Okay, I don't hate fifa, so I will say I hate multiplayer FPS.;;
And fifa now has single haha;;
Titanfall should be really cheap now. I love some multiplayer FPS but that's just me. Like rainbow six siege is quickly becoming one of my favorite games of all time.;;
"I didn't buy fifa this year because they decided to do ""half-regional"" price of 45 bucks, though previous years it was usual 30. And then at New years they did discount and it was like 25, but I didn't buy it";;
true. I regret buying fifa 2019;;
probably won't buy fifa 2020;;
I wouldn't regret and I won't regret if I will buy it, but fuck I hate when somebody doesn't go regional;;
On steam only stupid small games can go more then 30 bucks full price;;
But AAA is all 30 bucks max;;
Gawd, I can't stand fifa, play rocket league instead;;
And, I finally got unlimited internet, so maybe a stream *wednesday*?;;
Haha;;
To be honest, I'll be watching interview on Wednesday;;
How much for unlim  <@498246547838992414>;;
Lemme check properly;;
Lmao, it's less than we pay now lmao;;
‚Ç¨54 a month;;
Yeah that fucking crazy for me;;
But still...;;
And what speed?;;
200mbps;;
Nice;;
Yeah, I'm happy;;
Instantly going on a spree on steam;;
Shame that unlim doesn't mean free steam games   <@498246547838992414>;;
God damn, I think that I finally feel sleepy...Gonna try to get at least an hour of sleep. Later my dudes and my dudesses;;
"(I believe that I invented the world ""dudesses"" . I like  how it sounds haha)";;
Geez I pay $70 USD a month and I am only getting 100 mbps;;
"I wasn't talking about ""free"" OwO <@207416847019016202>";;
I know  <@498246547838992414>;;
But imagine unlim steam;;
Ohhh;;
That'd be just gr8;;
Goodnight  <@348165887347523594>;;
<@416803598173995018> Then I pay about 61 USD for my internet;;
And I pay only 10 for 200, but I will no start again about how my country is poor and everything else is way more expensive üòÇ;;
I'm thinking about starting my streams an hour earlier on thursdays and fridays;;
also about internet;;
I pay 250 bucks for 100 mb download;;
and basic TV;;
it's the same provider;;
<@488734758847905803> i understand that your country is poor, so is mine, but pleeeease, say real dollar price;;
and then you can say that salaries in brasil is very low;;
Lol <@207416847019016202> ya we talked about that last week I think.;;
yes we did;;
<@498246547838992414> dropped you a follow on Twitter and twitch. Sorry I wasn‚Äôt already following;;
dollar price - 80 USD;;
really?;;
yeah;;
still very much;;
but thanks for clearing that up at least;;
but as i said, internet prices are one of few things thats cheaper here;;
so we beat everybody in tech and gas prices;;
thats cool at least;;
we have cheap fruits and vegetables;;
hahaha;;
haha;;
you know, we of course have pricy fruits and veg comparing to warm countries;;
but generally i think food prices is lower than EUROPE and USA;;
well, maybe;;
but other from food, all the tech and etc... some times its crazy;;
i still cant get calm about the fact that the same capture card costs 125 in US and 500 here;;
and i mean real 500, you would say that its 2000 üòÄ;;
<@416803598173995018> It's no problem mate!! Thank you for the follows!!;;
hey peeps! I am live now;;
On my way to watch <@488734758847905803>;;

Hi <@409836692158021632> thanks for having me! üëç;;
It's really great having you and this discord is the best!!!;;
(run...get out while you can...now...);;
üòÇü§£üòÖ;;
theres no getting out;;
dammit...;;
One of us! One of us!;;
by the way thanks for chatting and hosting yesterday <@409836692158021632>;;
i appreciate that;;
Anytime man! My pleasure!;;
Oh no! This was all a ploy to lure me here and feast on my brains!;;
Hahaha...that Purple Mango guy,man...he knows how to lure em in!;;
you couldnt imagine what horrible things he is capable of;;
üëÄ üò± <:PM:539114910211112995>;;
Damn it! It was the beard that sucked me in!  My safe word is ‚Äòjambalaya‚Äô If I use it, get me the hell outta there!;;
thanks for joining us under the shade of the mango tree <@537319907541516311> !;;
how are you?;;
Hey <@488734758847905803> I‚Äôm good thank my man! Thank you for inviting me to the group. Hopefully, I can contribute some useful information and advice. Or if all else fails, I know a super recipe for a Victoria Sponge cake!;;
<@537319907541516311> what I want people to contribute here is with friendship / kindness / jokes.;;
no pressure to offer useful information and/or advice. Of course, if you do have something nice to share, then please do haha;;
nice!;;
I don'tknow that cake but it sounds tasty;;
What he meant is we are to stupid to put good information to use;;
so lets concentrate on love and jokes;;
lmfao;;
and here is one of the comedians of the discord ^;;
one of the clowns;;
haha;;
the clowniest one;;
the clowniest dongle;;
ah, also skydaze, we make a lot of dongle jokes.;;
Lol! Well it sounds like my kind of group. Have u started the #GamersAgainstVegans chat yet?;;
Good job <@!537319907541516311>, your dongle just grew to 1!;;
good to hear!;;
;;
I haven't haha;;
here in Brazil I know a vegan who doesn't push their diets on everyone else, so I personally dont know anybody who is annoying with that;;
I think in Brazil it's less of a thing to do that;;
Lol! Just like anything in life really. Be who you want to be, just don‚Äôt expect everyone else to do that. Don‚Äôt push something on others.;;
I feel like you guys have the same mentality.;;
haha i would assume that we dont have vegans here, or at least they are silent about it;;
so they should be haha;;
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇAmen.;;
we are not pushing here anything (besides <@488734758847905803>  with his novels);;
that's true <@537319907541516311> , i agree;;
yeah, the only thing I push here are dumps, dongle jokes and my novel;;
"Just wanted to say ""dongle""";;
Good dongle to all;;
Dingly dongly dongles.;;

his dongle gots pretty tense when he hears people voices;;
<@537319907541516311> gets the dongle jokes already haha;;
and yeah, I am a writer;;
if you want, I give sample chapters for free üòÉ;;

Pretty good <@488734758847905803> . how is everyone?;;

there is a sex scene or three in there;;
are you implying that my streams are not funny at the moment haha <@488734758847905803>;;
jk;;
but i appreciate that you liked my traitor joke;;
<@488734758847905803> He should lol;;
they are, but they'd be funnier if they were 100% jokes;;
yeah, i loved that joke haha;;
right, <@348165887347523594> ?;;
So right üòÉ;;
yeah, stop sucking at games and just do jokes - im not the only one to whom this advice can be applied, right <@488734758847905803> ?;;
Looks like you haven't slept much either <@160543395037708288> ?;;
i want to say, after 35 hours streaming Atom RPG, im now getting killed only every 3rd battle;;
hahahahaahahhahaha <@207416847019016202> you're not wrong;;
You're still getting killed a lot <@207416847019016202>;;
Thanks for the link <@488734758847905803> I will check it out. Looking forward to the m√©nage a trois paragraph.;;
You were getting killed so many times I fell asleep and thought you were playing a totally different game the whole time....Felt weird ...I was sure you were talking to me;;
anytime <@537319907541516311>;;
if you slept less on my streams, you would know that yesterday i almost didnt get killed <@348165887347523594>  üòÄ;;
lmao;;
hahaha;;
Almost means what exactly?;;
Hey <@488734758847905803> , can my name be in another color than red?  It feels aggressive . Doesn't matter which color, just not red.;;
i got into that battle with 10 small rats and one big. it was too much and they killed my main characters several times, but fidel ruled, oneshotting every one of them with a rifle.;;
but apart from that battle, no one else yesterday killed me. like NO ONE. i won all the battles incuding 4 armed guys and some huge bears and gorillas, thanks to one shot master fidel <@348165887347523594>;;
I think I remember that part actually <@207416847019016202>;;
yeah;;
You know what guys, I think I'm gna feel right at home in this group!;;

So, every month the Mango Council and I pick the streamers of the week for that month.;;
mango councilpeople cannot be chosen for streamer of the week.;;
We make our decisions based on who is active here in the discord and supportive of other streamers;;
this month's was Nylllaa last week,;;
now it's <@416803598173995018> ;;
then <@278571432588345345> ;;
then <@217089479863697418>;;
and we ask people to  go give the s treamer of the week some extra love and support;;
That is really admirable <@488734758847905803> . So tell me this, whose dongles do I have to play with to get streamer of the week?;;
lmao;;

Happy to do my bit, even if it means taking a dongle or 7;;
hahaahah;;
gotta take it to earn it;;
<@537319907541516311> You can play with mine. My dongle has a big heart . A real whore;;
<@348165887347523594> 's dongle is like a mother's heart, you can always fit another;;
I try to play with it as much as I can, but it's never content;;
üòÇ I love a slutty dongle;;
<@488734758847905803> üòÇ;;
Damn, seems that Anthem did really bad this weekend. Just went on youtube and the reactions are pretty negative overall;;
EA are like the vegans og the gaming industry;;
True, and Bioware my not survive this;;
lmao;;
I'm one of the only people I know that enjoyed Andromeda though. I got it way after it was all patched up;;
<@537319907541516311> , do you think the word dongle sounds sexual?;;
"cause I was playing hitman and it told me I needed a dongle key, and I was like ""that sounds sexual af""";;
Its a shame, coz Bioware know how to do breasts in video games;;
really <@348165887347523594> ? but i heard the story was kinda bad too;;
lmao;;
<@488734758847905803> It does sound sexual and I love it haha;;
<@488734758847905803>  dongle is filth. I can't actually remember what a real dongle looks like. All I can visualise is the wrong kind of dongles.;;
"I thought the story was good actually. But I may have pretty low standards, just give a look at how I enjoy making stories about that single word ""dongle"". I can't stop";;
lmao g uys;;
it's been nice chatting brothers, but I have to clean the house;;
I can't stand it anymore;;
Good luck;;
thanks!;;
it's not so much clean as organize;;
but still;;
Use your dongle;;
Later <@488734758847905803>  What countries do you all live in? Or should I say who has the nearest dongle to mine?;;
Martinique;;
shit I just realized that I didnt say welcome to the shade of the mango tree <@450002701904773132> !!!;;
i missed the bot saying you joined;;
i live in Brazil at the moment <@537319907541516311>;;
Sao Paulo to be exact;;
But Martinique isn't a country;;
thanks for joining the discord <@450002701904773132> and I'm very sorry to have missed that;;
Don't be shy <@278571432588345345> , I saw you  faken lurking;;
lol;;
üòÖ;;
So <@488734758847905803>  did you live in the US as well?;;
I am in London, England btw. Dangerously close to <@278571432588345345>;;
I did, I was born in NJ;;
<:porg:467237850950402058>;;

Good job <@!537319907541516311>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
here it goes, your dongle is already getting thicc;;
<@348165887347523594> I can't believe the girth already!;;
Andromeda was shit. Story was shit, characters were shit. We are not friends any more  <@348165887347523594>;;
I'm from Russia  <@537319907541516311>;;
<@537319907541516311> You won't believe your eyes in a few days;;
No we aren't, we are BFFFFFFFL <@207416847019016202> . I don't care what you think;;
Deal with it;;
I don't care too. So andromeda still shit;;

hahaha;;
<@207416847019016202> Diluted shit with colorant and sugar....alright in my books;;
No one liked Andromeda but me üò¶;;
Andromeda - is this some kind of dongle stimulant??;;
It's both game Mass Effect Andromeda and apparently dongle stimulant for  <@348165887347523594>;;
hahah, it does sound like some kind of stimulant, or dongle pain reliever after too much dongle action  <@537319907541516311>;;
Donglemeda;;
I have dongle-itis. I need some of that Andromeda.;;
üòÖ;;

but really beautifully drawn backgrounds and characters;;
lol I was scrolling up to where I was tagged about whose dongle someone had to play with for streamer of the month. You guys are something else lol üòÇ <@488734758847905803>;;
Good morning everyone;;
morning;;
morning <@287320205020102667>;;
and it's good to hear <@207416847019016202> I particularly like the minigames and I'd wanted way more of them;;
for now ive managed to go without any googling <@87241615671832576>;;
i wanted to do it couple of times;;
but then i managed to solve it;;
i want to say that everything is very logical;;
it is.;;
"you dont have to ""apply everything to everything"" like in some games";;
"you just know, that ""you dont need to apply gloves to apple""";;
because you dont see why;;
and in many games it would be the right decision to try it;;
well, some games are funny exactly because you combine two uncombinable  items, but for the most part its annoying;;
in in this game (that have suprisingly different pronounciation comparing to how it reads) its all very intuitive;;
and main character if fascinating;;
those evil eyes;;
haha, she's an angry little girl;;
yeah, angry is the right word. sometimes i have triubles with finding right word for translation;;
But I agree on you with the puzzles. They should be logical and actually make sense when you've used them and a lot of these point & click adventures don't do it;;
i get it üòÉ;;
Good job <@!87241615671832576>, your dongle just grew to 5!;;
Have the same problem at times;;
"and (without spoilers) i laughed a lot about duck ""puzzle""";;
you were sure that you need medallion to deal with duck, and it turned out differently <@87241615671832576>;;
yeahh I üòÉ It was quite fun, especially because it's one grumpy duck;;
But if you are there, you are almost done actually;;
yeah thought so;;
im little after that;;
the game is not that long. I played it again afterwards, when I wanted to write a review and it was like 1 hour;;
with bear somewhere;;
ahh;;
i play games veeery slowly;;
i beat one puzzle - 2 hours of procrastinating after that;;
then back to game and one more puzzle;;
steam says i played for 12 hours;;
its mostly afk;;
ahh, that's quite good üòÉ especially if you still enjoy it. I play these games like if I rad a book;;
Ahh makes sense;;
well i really like when theres no interaction in ga,e;;
did you played To the Moon?;;
maybe i asked already;;
No, I think i have it;;
2 sec;;
going to have a look;;
i love that game and 2 next ones;;
but i want to say - its pure story;;
you just walk and do little puzzles sometimes;;
Yeahh I have it. Maybe I should go an play it;;
but puzzle puzzles;;
not item puzzles;;
ahh I'd give it a look;;
but i would say that 90% of game is pressing key to read next line;;
<@348165887347523594> would enjoy listening to it haha;;
Duck puzzle you're saying?;;
yep;;
there was a duck;;
but its not that game that youve would enjoy listening;;
because theres nothing to listen;;
good morning all!;;
morning <@312379820933906442>;;
how are you doing <@207416847019016202>;;
im good, work is almost done;;
how are you;;
very sleepy today;;
haha;;
im usually sleepy when i slept more than 6-7 hours at night;;
same here;;
i dont understand it;;
haha im used to it;;
i try to sleep as less as i can;;
because for me its wasting time which i could spent playing games;;
lol thats a different way at looking at things;;
you know, some people a very useless at evening, for example;;
and i got most energy at evening;;
after long work day;;
i come home;;
eat;;
and fuck, after that im full of energy;;
so its the time for games and such;;
lmao;;
not sure what thats like just yet;;
i still have some time üòõ;;
so basically im pretty free after 21-22... so the later i will go sleep, the better;;
and i usually go at 3-5 am;;
then wake up at 9-10 and go to work;;
i used to be able to stay up that late but school and work have been destroying me lol;;
well some times im just shutting of early;;
and sleep;;
like once a week;;
yea we can only do so much sometimes;;
sup to all, how is the today treating you?;;
<@348165887347523594> did your name change colour?;;
*jealous*;;
haha, yeah,  I didn't like the color red, I thought it was too aggressive;;
if its red its dead!;;
Red is *my* colour;;
T R I G G E R E D;;
lool;;
hey thats every gamers phrase!!!!!;;
<@111826600395378688> True;;
It was way too reddish though...almost hard to read;;
Maybe;;
But what do the mango councilpeople do now, now that there are moderators?;;
I thought the councilpeople were the mods;;
Nah <@498246547838992414> , the mango council helps choose streamer of the week;;
<@348165887347523594> and <@207416847019016202> are moderators, so they have semi-godly powers;;
<@488734758847905803> ahh;;
wow, I feel so powerful;;
Me dumb dumb;;
Haha nah it's ok. How would you know <@498246547838992414> ?;;
Yeah <@348165887347523594> , you're like that colossus I couldn't beat yesterday;;
I've been here for a little bit  <@488734758847905803>;;
Honestly, I didn't know before yesterday <@498246547838992414> , I waited for someone to ask before I do üòÖ;;
<@488734758847905803> with a rock briefs;;
<@348165887347523594> Lmao, glad I did now XD;;
Yeah haha;;
is it sad that the games that are currently out dont interest me anymore...;;
It is very sad <@111826600395378688> , but not your fault;;
We're getting oldee;;
Older*;;
<@111826600395378688> Yeah, I've been playing the same game for 3 years nearly;;
<@111826600395378688> like which games?;;
all of them;;
....;;
<@111826600395378688> *buy all the games on steam*;;
i use to play trove like hardcore it was easy to play and fun... but then they decided to make that shit P2W and that doesnt sit well with me;;
i have like 250;;
I'm tired of open world games on my end;;
P2W sucks for broke-ass people, like me;;
im asian so im cheap;;
Good job <@!111826600395378688>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
I haven't even been able to finish RDR 2....and I know it's a great game...I just can't get back to it;;
lol <@111826600395378688>;;
<@111826600395378688> *oof*;;
i have some friends that have dropped 10k on mobile games..;;
im sitting over here with like maybe $6s;;
.... What?;;
That's insane;;
yup summoners war....;;
and Path of exile;;
Wow;;
and some other game they trying to get me to buy in to;;
10k, are they mad?;;
one guy has bought every pack that PoE has come out for;;
that a whole lot of money. I've spent my share of money on clash of clans, but nothing that even comes close to that;;
thats over a few years but yea;;
the other friend...;;
im sure hes dropped over 40k;;
hes always buying shit;;
maybe even more;;
I've never spent money on a mobile game;;
hes like in the top100 in summons war;;
i have here and there if i enjoy it;;
I've only bought minecraft pe on my Ipad;;
but over all the mobile games i think i might have dropped like $40sa;;
Well mobile games can take up your money with you even noticing you've spent a shit load  of money on it;;
here ill find u a article...;;
Over the pas 6 years, I think that I have spent something close to 1k euros on clash of clans. I never thought I did but thinking about it yeah...The amount of times I've bought 10 euros of gemmes in those 6 years is insane;;
Haha you crazy  <@348165887347523594>;;
I never spent anything on in game purchaces;;
I kinda understand  <@111826600395378688>;;
Of all the games that will be out next several months or already out this year, I'm interested only in New subnautuca. And I found out about it just recently. But all the other games doesn't interest me at all;;
FFFF i cant find it;;
but it was showing that fortnite made 3 billion last year and some of these mobile games made like 200 billion;;
I did, like a lot of times...Once you make one in game purchase, it gets addicting <@207416847019016202>;;
Sometimes I can go all crazy;;
Haha I guess I'm really not addictive person;;
At all;;
It's actually the only game I ever made in game purchases....and the only online mobile game I have been playing.;;
Well I lied. I've spent couple of dollars on Simpson's mobile game 6 years ago. That's all lol;;
clash of clans is basically part of my life. I have made lots of friends there. I have white hears now that I didn't not when I started. I even dated a girl I met on it.;;
And she didn't turn out to be a guy?  <@348165887347523594>;;
<@207416847019016202> hahahaha;;
Or that's okay? üòÇ;;
In fact, she was dating another guy from my clan, and like a year after, they broke up...than we started talking a lot on the phone, then, she actually travelled from Metropole(France main land) to come see me here in Martinique;;
I wasn't too pleased with this relation ship anyway....it didn't last long. And it sucked cause the guy she was dating was actually a pretty cool dude.;;
That's some quality love of clans story;;
üòÖ;;
Or should I say crush of clans;;
lol, man, this game made lots of couples from what I've heard.;;
Haha;;
And I'm sure broke a lot too;;
I've seen a youtuber cry live once;;
Yeah I think so too <@207416847019016202>;;
I saw today somebody called you kellyhd;;
It makes sense since yesterday you were able to watch my stream in hd;;
lol, who was that?;;
yeah, yesterday twitch seemed to be working fine for me;;
I don't remember, you were chatting with someone in one of discords;;
You chat a lot man;;
You too;;
Haha;;
That's true;;
Do we have a problem ?? üòÇ;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 17!;;
Haha mee6 agrees with me;;
<@159985870458322944> is cool dude, he should get a bigger dongle himself;;
"Have you seen that movie ""Glass"" yet?";;
No and I don't think I want to. As I understand it's some kind of sequel. So I need to watch first one. And I don't want to. I just discovered for myself show named Brooklyn 9-9 and it's fucking fanstastic;;
Yeah, it's a funny show;;
love brooklyn 99;;
I love that kind of humour, and Andy Samberg personally;;
We watched 7 episodes and hyped about next ones;;
It's my kind of humor too actually. And yeah, you won't regret it.;;
I dont;;
I just finished watching Travelers. Damn this show is breath taking at times. Can't wait for the 4th season. It was unexpected.;;
Workahollics was great too;;
FUUUG;;
i feel so empty...;;
rip brb;;
https://psychcentral.com/blog/when-you-feel-empty-what-it-means-what-to-do-2/;;
this is how i feel;;
weird..;;
It is not that weird, I feel all these things too. So I'll will tell you to stay strong and you're not alone;;
I feel that too sometimes, you're not alone my dude <@111826600395378688>;;
<@498246547838992414> love workaholics. My favorite TV show of all time though is, it's always sunny in philadelphia;;
I've never heard of that lmao;;
Yeah <@111826600395378688>  it definitely isn't a weird thing to feel;;
I feel that sometimes too;;
I felt it more frequently when I was younger thankfully;;
But it still happens sometimes. It catches you off guard;;
But that feeling always goes away eventually;;
I usually try to distract myself with mundane activities;;
<@498246547838992414> you should check it out, it's amazing;;
I'll do that <@416803598173995018>;;
Or if you feel really overwhelmed, try finding 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell and 1 you can taste;;
It's called grounding;;
Sounds interesting <@488734758847905803>;;
It helps a lot <@498246547838992414> , you have no idea;;
Haha;;
It's saved me plenty of times in the past;;
What I do is just watch  youtube or so, just to have something to do;;
Sometimes, I'd just sit there staring at nothing;;
But, I'd realise that I was unproductive, and try to move on;;
Upbeat music and working out help me with that. Just don't turn to drugs or alcohol, for real. I had a slight problem with alcohol for multiple reasons a few years back and its not fun;;
there's also a candle that I like to smell and it calms me down. Sounds dumb but it honestly helps me de-stress and stuff;;
I know the dangers of alcohol <@416803598173995018> and upbeat music gives me terminal illnesses, so I just stick to metal;;
I need something I can jam out to;;
lol ya that's what I meant. I listen to all sorts of music, metal included. Just depends on the mood I'm in and I go with what will help me at that time;;
Yeah, mood doesn't affect my music at all, just whatever I feel like at the moment;;
Yeah same for me I suppose. I love most kinds of music, a few categories I hate though lol;;
I for one can't stand the Dutch rap, that's big here in Belgium;;
lol honestly never heard of dutch rap before;;
I dont like most rap or pop, country music is big in America if you know that and I dont really like that either;;
I dig a little country, pop I can't listen to for more than 10 minutes though;;
lol same. Do you know Rammstein? I'm not sure they can be classified as metal but they are one of my favorites;;
Yeah, they're classed as Industrial Metal, whatever that means;;
Good job <@!498246547838992414>, your dongle just grew to 12!;;
lol oh right. Yeah no clue what that means but I love them. Nice dongle;;
Thank you, I'm coming for you;;
lol same rank now;;
or same dongle I mean;;
NUMBER 5 WILL BE MINE;;
lol we gotta catch <@207416847019016202> he's number 2;;
Everyone, gang up on orange;;
im 2nd long ago haha;;
but its good thing to gang up on me, thats way here will be more messages;;
I havent been around as much lately. I was 2 and 3 for awhile lol;;
lol that's true <@207416847019016202> we wouldnt catch you if you kept talking;;
and i will;;
33 years already people trying shup me down;;
no luck still;;
Okay oneMansGreEn;;
Because your name is green now;;
lol oh yeah hey mine used to be blue;;
oh wait its cause I am streamer of the week;;
I knew that....lol;;
*master chief*;;
you know it! Halo was one of the first games I truly loved;;
Never played any of them, I was a ps plebian all my life;;
Now I'm a pc scrub;;
I wish I had a PC;;
"i read it ""i was ps lesbian""";;
i thought wow;;
lmao;;
Wahaahahaa;;
I don't play much Playstation anymore, but I do still play skyrim and fallout 4 and the like on it;;
Just not any competitive games, like on pc;;
Been a console gamer my whole life but I really want a pc this year;;
I got one, It was on sale;;
I love it;;
I got the pc for 999, when it was 1399;;
Then add up the price for a new keyboard and mouse, in the end I paid like 1250;;
That‚Äôs not bad. I want to build one this year. My uncle does that for a part time job so he‚Äôs going to help me with it.;;
"i think last time when i bought ""whole pc"" was 2001. since then it was just separate parts, or maybe several parts at a time, but never whole";;
Yeah I want to do that <@207416847019016202> just get pieces and build it to the specifications I want;;
im sure its cheaper;;
at leats here <@416803598173995018>;;
because you can buy pieces at different stores that way;;
i recently just bought myself 6TB HDD for 300 bucks;;
Yeah you can do that here too. That's what I will do, some places are cheaper than others so you can save money in the long run;;
how's it dangling, dongles?;;
I just got caught up with the chat here *whew*;;
been a busy morning here in the dongle squad!;;
it looks like it! a lot of dongle growth I see...;;
haha;;
good day to you <@409836692158021632>;;
ah...dobroye utro, brat! <@207416847019016202>;;
good morning, brother from a Russian mother!;;
Haha;;
I see your Russian dongle is growing  <@409836692158021632>;;
I am learning the language of your motherland under the shade of this mango tree!!!;;
You can't until there's no snow around;;
damn...I need snow...and vodka;;
Here's your snow;;
It's my balcony, I store some things in those plastic crates;;
Thank you! ;;
"What sort of ""things"" are in these plastic crates??? (Please say dead bodies...)";;
Bodies of our American enemies of course;;
Ah, of course! Well done, comrade!;;
üòÇ;;
haha whoa whoa!;;
I didnt choose to be American! I definitely dont like it though lol;;
Just some useful shit like nails and screwdrivers;;
Sorry this convo took a turn <@416803598173995018> üòÅ;;
And great stream btw yesterday!;;
Ok, <@207416847019016202> ;;
But what are these nails and screwdrivers used for hmmm???;;
You better tell me you're building a Mango Tree House!!!;;
lol it's all good, just messing around. Wait <@409836692158021632> dont you live in California? lol;;
I screwed this piece of wood to my table, it's the only useful thing I did. Mango house can wait;;
Shhhh <@416803598173995018> ;;
I was trying to be sneaky in front of our russian BFFFFFL here...;;
I hope he doesn't find out...;;
Too late;;
<@207416847019016202> one;;
Riiiiiiiight...;;
Seems legit;;
I can smell american;;
lmao;;
Hahahaha;;
He can smell American! I need that on a t-shirt!;;
lol yeah thats awesome;;
<@488734758847905803> needs to write a children's book starring <@207416847019016202> now...;;
Fee Fi Fo Fum...I can smell...Ameri-CAN!;;
üòÅ üìñ;;
lol I'd buy it!;;
haha;;
but joking aside though, *this discord is the most culturally diverse I've been in and I love that everyone has been really really cool...*;;
except for <@160543395037708288> üòù;;
lol yeah it really is. Thats why I was joking and saying, good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone cause I have no clue where everyone lives;;
Yeah this discord is pretty cool;;
haha I agree!;;
your Russian accent is pretty cool too <@207416847019016202> ;;
it's almost like the real thing!;;
lmao almost like the real thing;;
It's actually not real lol;;
It's more like movies russian;;
It's kinda exaggerated;;
Real Russian accent is way less articulate that mine on streams or that in movies;;
ahhh ok lol;;
I was gonna do accents in my stream just to be funny, might be stupid though but I am really good at a lot of them. What do you think?;;
my only suggestion is to keep practicing...you'll get there someday;;
dude, <@416803598173995018> that would be great!!!;;
well since <@488734758847905803> is not ashamed of his accents, so you should try it too <@416803598173995018>;;
<@207416847019016202> I don't even notice his accent honestly;;
i mean when he does accents;;
<@409836692158021632> thanks! Maybe I will do it today. People have told me I should be a voice actor before lol;;
ohhhh ok, I didnt know he did that;;
when he does russian accent and such;;
his russian accent imo 100% italian lol;;
lmao thats hilarious;;
My Russian accent is all right. My best are Australian, Scottish, British, Irish and German I think;;
My asian accent is just plain racist though lol so I dont do that one hahaha;;
hahaha yeah no on the asian one;;
my asian friends think its hilarious but anyone outside of them would probably kick my ass lol;;
haha;;
I'd love to hear your British and German accents while playing Siege...;;
Vat are yu do-eeng? Do eet! Do eet naooooo!;;
Wait that's more Arnold...nevermind;;
Good job <@!409836692158021632>, your dongle just grew to 6!;;
lol I do a great Arnold impression!;;
I'll do some tonight when I stream Red dead, my southern accent is pretty damn good too;;
awww yeah!;;
where are you in rdr2? <@416803598173995018>;;
what chapter?;;
<@207416847019016202> I dont even remember. Havent touched it in over a month;;
Last thing I remember was killing the first legendary bear so Im not far;;
yeah i think 2nd chapter or even 1st;;
I think 2nd, I got bored with it really easily honestly;;
same with spider-man;;
I have really bad attention defecite disorder so when games aren't go go go all the time, I get bored and stop playing them;;
haha;;
well in rdr2 you can go go go;;
its exactly what i did;;
yeah but theres so much time in between stuff so I just got bored lol. I regret buying it when it was first released, I gotta stop doing that;;
Thats why Im streaming it tonight cause it will be a shorter stream than usual lol;;
"haha so this stupid advice ""dont preorder games"" is for you <@416803598173995018>";;
if im ready to buy game on start, and want to play it, i do it, and never regret;;
I dont preorder lol but I do buy it within the first week usually. I almost did it with resident evil 2 this week but my friend bought it, so I just used his instead lol;;
well for me playing from the start and preordering is the same thing;;
how can i play from the start if i didnt download it;;
ahh fair enough lol;;
certain games I dont regret doing that, in the past year only spider man and red dead I regret buying;;
i think only full price i regret is shenmue 1 & 2 remaster;;
it has very strange old camera, and when i move in the game, it makes me really sick;;
i dont know why;;
but feeling dizzy;;
I felt that way about the resident evil 1 remake;;
aside from that i always wanted to check out that games;;
but cant play;;
basically the same game as on playstation 1 but with better graphics lol. same controls and camera angles;;
me too, just money and time are against me lol;;
Damn, what a long day this was. My phone didn't stop ringing. I'm so out that I'm supposed to meet a client in a hour just so she can deliver me a check and I don't even want to do that.;;
dongle down emojii;;
yeah, dongle flat right now;;
My phone battery is almost dead and it was fully charged this morning. It's that bad lol;;
Oof, long days are never fun;;
Long Dongles though... That's a different story;;
I want to sleep so bad, but if I do, I will most likely miss that quick appointment;;
SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK!;;
lol <@498246547838992414> if its long but dangling on the down side it's no sweet dongle;;
<@416803598173995018> hell yeah ...for the weak(me trying to find some energy . I bet you once I get that check and I can finally call it a day....I won't be sleepy anymore;;
Dragging along the floor  <@348165887347523594>;;
<@498246547838992414> picking up dust haha;;
Sweeping the floor;;
lol nope youll be wide awake later;;
Exactly, you know how it goes right?;;
*vacuum cleaner dongle*;;
lol all too well. Im exhausted right now at work but will be wide awake later;;
lmao, a good dongle should be a clean dongle, I can' t let this happen;;
<@416803598173995018> Frickin' timezones, one day, ONE DAY, I'll make it to one of your streams;;
*one day*;;
dont put your dongle into vacuum cleaner <@498246547838992414>;;
<@498246547838992414> I'll believe it when I see it. If you really loved me, you'd stay up for it!;;
"Same thing happens to me everyday <@416803598173995018> ...Once I'm finally able to get some rest, my brain says ""no sir""";;
lol just messing around;;
It needs a cleaning  <@207416847019016202>;;
You heard the man <@498246547838992414> , find a way;;
If I can get an early stream in on the weekend, you can tune in for sure but that doesnt happen very often;;
I'm sorry honey, but I can't let you get in the way of my own health and education, I do love you, for sure, but our love is hard, but we'll get through it <@416803598173995018>;;
lmao;;
I am horrible;;
health and education are overrated;;
<@416803598173995018> Exactly;;
Who needs a *JOB* later;;
And who even needs to stay alive;;
Being alive is overrated;;
hahahaha...staying alive is for the weak!!;;
Hmm...;;
Show some balls and forget staying alive;;
I will  <@348165887347523594>;;
You better!!;;
I will grow an extra set;;
Then go bowling;;
Naaahh, do it Kratos style, let it grow on your chin..;;
Hahaha <@498246547838992414>;;
I wanna be kratos lmao;;
Me too, but thinking about it, can you imagine being punch in your face would also feel like being kicked to the nuts....my god , not so good;;
Is that why he has a beard now?;;
*Ball chin*?;;
maybe lol;;
damn, I need to get ready to go meet that client....Whish me luck;;
<@348165887347523594> I wish you luck, my friend;;
Luck to your dongle, hope shes cute <@348165887347523594>;;
or at least young;;
Be sure to devour the female when you're done with her, that way you get her powers, that's what I learned anyway  <@348165887347523594>;;
thats what they teach you in belgium elementary;;
<@207416847019016202> Yes;;
"No wonder our grades are so ""high""";;
üòÇ üòÇ;;
I'm ready, now I just have to wait for to call me. And  no she is not young not a bit <@207416847019016202>;;
So I can't tell you if she's cute...She is not an ugly woman though;;
haha;;
that will do;;
voice is what matter;;
lol, naaaaahhh I don't think so, it won't do;;
<@207416847019016202> omg hahahaha;;
<@348165887347523594> *kill kill kill kill*;;
<@498246547838992414> Your schools must be making geniuses;;
<@348165887347523594> Like me lmao;;
I can tell my man üòÉ;;
me are relly smerd;;
<@207416847019016202> is always playing some game, like all day long...doesn't matter if he's at work, sleeping eating, taking a shit...his name tag is always showing him playing;;
On the bus, at home playing with is dongle, or someone playing with it for him, he never stops playing.;;
haha;;
actually not;;
Orange is a true epic gamer;;
epic;;
when im at home there s good chance that some game launched, even if im not playing it;;
but when im at work, TES legends is launched only when i play it;;
Really? Your computer must be pretty powerful. I never leave a game running if I'm not playing it;;
haha of course my computer powerful;;
why would it not be;;
i can run 2 games some times;;
without problems;;
Damn, what does it have under the belly?;;
and i can have several twitch tabs opened haha;;
nothing too cool and new, just some old i7 + 16 GB RAM;;
but its still pretty enough;;
i bought it 5 years ago;;
and video  780 ti i think or something like that;;
5 years old;;
I think that we have a similar config. But mine seem actually more powerful than yours;;
I guess it depends on the games running then;;
well then it sould not be a problem for you left game open;;
tbh i need to clean it a little, so my CPU fan would not go high;;
maybe change thermopaste... but im too lazy;;
Same thing here, I'm too lazy to take care of that;;
I just got an extra 980 gtx strix for about 100 euros....It's my first sli setup and  it's pretty decent. I haven't kept a pc for this long in years. I don't think I ever did though;;
so cheap?;;
let me google..;;
hm i cant find it here;;
is it old?;;
it's about 5 years old...The owner wanted to get rid of it for a 1080 ti;;
now i got it;;
so its used;;
thats ok;;
no wonder that all stores here got it in quantity of 0;;
I just think that gpu's are so overpriced right now....I'm not even looking for a brand new upgrade. Lots of affordable parts on the net;;
Finally I didn't have to drive to go get my check from the client, she came right in front of my door. I'm so relieved I didn't have to drive there;;
gpus costs even more here;;
even not considering salaries;;
just more;;
And yeah the gtx 980 was a freaking bargain for just 100 euros. I actually had no issues with just one since I have only have 1080p screens;;
i have 1080 tv too;;
I had a gtx 780 before and on 1080p I didn't have issues;;
Back then I use to build a new pc every 2 years, sometimes I would not even wait this long. But these last 5 years prices have gone crazy;;
It would cost me close to 3000 euros to make a new build that I actually want.;;
10-15 years ago you HAD to upgrade pc a lot;;
otherwise your pc was shit;;
total shit that could not run games;;
it stopped when xbox360 and ps3 came out;;
TRUE;;
that consoles ruled about 7 years, and pcs didnt upgrade too much either;;
and you know, i did right choice;;
"for example. someone said to me like ""go cheaper, buy i5""";;
i bought i7, and 16 RAM (which at the time looked unnecessary);;
and after 5 years i fell perfect;;
"I had a i5 for 2 days, I was lucky (or unlucky enough) to kill it before I even used it. I was able to swap it for an i7 and after seeing the performance of the first generation of ""i5"" processors , I have no regrets";;
haha;;
2 days is solid;;
I have been a console guy for the most part of my life. Never got used to playing with keyboard and mouse. Only strategy games . But I slowly turn to pc gaming when the xbox one never stopped deceiving me;;
well all my life i played pc but i hate mouse and keyboard;;
i use it when i had to, in rpgs and adventures;;
but if game has gamepad support, im on it;;
I still play most games with gamepads but I feel the pain when playing multiplayer competitive Fps games....Even the division. Mouse and keyboard player have a clear advantage.;;
haha i NEVER play multiplayer competitive Fps;;
I figured that I'd avoid that kind of games on pc...and get the console versions;;
i tried division beta, but it has multiplayer and not so much story;;
the second one you mean?;;
Or the first?;;
first;;
when it was beta i mean;;
2 or 3 years ago;;
2 i think;;
I started the division last year in February when it was all patched up. I had never invested much time in an mmo of that style before. I was surprised I enjoyed it so much.;;
well not my kind of game i think;;
i hate interact with people in games;;
i play 2 MMOs, but only 100% alone;;
Not my kind either, but I would play solo most of the time really. And when I wanted to grind fast, I would do some pve missions . The leveling up and grind was fast and well done. I haven't tried any other mmos after that;;
all i need in game is a lot of talking and cut scenes;;
got you;;
what game are you playing now guys?;;
right now Wolfenstein 2;;
sweet;;
i just finished TSIOQUE that <@87241615671832576> advised to me. i will discuss it when he will be here;;
ok cool;;
You look interested by state of decay 2 <@488734758847905803> ?;;
I do;;
do you have it? <@348165887347523594> ?;;
maybe that is another game we can play;;
I bought assassin's creed black flag 2 months ago, I haven't even installed it.;;
but I still want to play gears of war with you;;
Yeah why not <@488734758847905803>;;
noice;;
<@348165887347523594> btw XCOM 1 have multiplayer, not co op as i understand;;
Hello all! I hope everyone is having a wonderful day;;
hey <@272988530278662146> !!;;
I had a long day, but it was good;;
I still have to do some work though;;
hey <@272988530278662146>;;
I took yesterday and today off lol;;
im having wonderful night;;

My wife is currently playing KH3;;
Im about to pick up some dinner and see if I can play a little;;
doubt it;;
but ehh I can try;;
<@207416847019016202>  I hope its a good night man.;;
its good;;
oh damn, I need some KH3;;

shame!;;
shame!;;
shame!;;
shame!;;
yeah i hiddenly hate everyone who play game and didnt finished previous ones;;

Yea purplemango is a awesome dude I forgive him;;
><;;
haha thank you guys ‚ù§;;
I usually don't like doing that either <@207416847019016202>;;
i did it couple of times i think;;
but like in whole life;;
i started FF from 7, and after that started from 1st one;;
also, i didnt play bioshock 1 and 2, i  just played infinite;;
and the last one, i started call of duty from modern warfare;;
<@207416847019016202> Really? I thought it had multiplayer. So it's only the second one? that's odd;;
i just told you that 1st one HAVE multiplayer <@348165887347523594>;;
hoo yeah sorry, I didn't read properly, I'm on the phone with my 4g subscriber trying to recharge my data limit;;

I‚Äôm tired I‚Äôm getting ready to go to sleep. Back to work tomorrow. Heading to Wisconsin;;
Your dongle will be very big before you know it;;
I‚Äôm tired too, but I‚Äôm trying to finish my moccasins lol;;
Morning everyone!;;
<@488734758847905803> come chill under the shade of the abssii dongle;;
Morning! <@207416847019016202>;;
Morning everyone;;
Morning  <@524820041976250368>,  <@87241615671832576>;;
How are you guys;;
Just woke up and still incredibly tired;;
I finished tsioque yesterday  <@87241615671832576>;;
It is very cool;;
I didn't anticipate that kind of ending at all;;
Cool I really hoped You'd enjoy it, and the ending also surprised me. I found the story really compelling;;
I‚Äôm good extremely tired haven‚Äôt slept yet. How‚Äôre you? <@207416847019016202>;;
I'm extremely awake and extremely going to work  <@524820041976250368>;;
So I should check out unawoved now?  <@87241615671832576>;;
It's 5 dollars for me now, no discount;;
Lol sounds fun, I just finished watching a few streams about to go to sleep gotta get up early <@207416847019016202>;;
I don't know Unawoved <@207416847019016202> so I have no clue about if it's good or not;;
I was sure that you advised it to me so I was wrong;;
Please remind me then what game you could else advice me?  <@87241615671832576>;;
I think I confused names;;
I am not sure if I have had adviced anything else. I have not really played anything new lately;;
Hm;;
Oh I got it;;
Found;;
You advised tsioque and then silver came and advised pillars and unavowed  <@87241615671832576>;;
Sorry, got it wrong;;
Ahh true, Pillars are also one I need to try out.;;
I started pillars, but wasn't so invested in it, unlike one my friend, who loved it (but usually he don't play games like this);;
And I will always recommend Slay the spire if you are into dungeon crawler deck building  card games.;;
I love idea of card games, but any kind of losing progress pisses me of, so I don't play anything like roquelikes and such;;
It's  not a true roque like as people want it to be. You progress through the game by building your deck up. If you lose all life you are done with that game, If you manage to climb the entire tower you'll get an ascension  which basically makes the game harder and you'll need to get better at building your deck and play your cards.;;
So if not really progression through loss, but more loss is the punishment of you not knowing better.;;
But I get it if it turns you off ;);
If you lose all life you are done with that game;;
thats kind of phrase that turns off me 100% without question <@87241615671832576>;;
and even if i will try it, ill delete it when it will happen üòÄ;;
that why i loved subnautica so much. all the joy from crafting games, but no real consequences for death;;
Morning everyone.;;
Morning;;
morning <@300033838065778702>;;
How are you today? <@207416847019016202>;;

Ahh. I just woke up. Time to get ready for work.;;
morning mangoes;;

prepare your nasty questions;;

hey <@160543395037708288> , sorry bud, it was 5am almost when you sent that hahaha;;
<@524820041976250368> , were you making moccasins?;;
morning mango seeds!;;
morning <@87241615671832576> sorry i did not see your text. FeelsBadMan;;

hey <@87241615671832576> !;;
today we are going to interview our boi <@278571432588345345>;;
nothing much. i have a chiropractor appointment today after work.;;
i hope i can be there for the interview;;
<:letsgojonny:536238079434817536>;;
Ahh sounds interesting and hope the chiropractor goes well;;
what time is your appointment <@300033838065778702> ?;;
5pm UK time <@488734758847905803>;;
i should be home before 6.30pm;;
true that;;
hope you can make it as well;;
what city do you live in?;;
thanks <@87241615671832576> really hope it can help with my back too;;
i live in London;;
it might have been mentioned before and i might have missed it, but what time will the interview be?;;
ah true you did;;
my bad;;
I'm like dorothy from fucking nemo;;
I mean finding nemo;;
you might have downloaded the wrong movie Kappa <@488734758847905803>;;
the interview will be at 20:30 uk time;;
lmao <@300033838065778702>;;
speaking of finding nemo;;
did you guys know that nemo means no one in  latin?;;
ahh. i will definitely be there for it then üòÑ;;
I'm also based in london *highfive*  <@300033838065778702>;;
so, there's this fucked up adult theory that nemo's dad was actually suffering from ptsd;;
and he had no son at all;;
like silent hill under the sea;;
ayy <@278571432588345345> *highfives back*;;
oh damn that is dark lmao;;
<@278571432588345345> which bit of London are you at?;;
right?;;
I live in Croydon;;
i like to read those adult theories about movies. some of them can be really interesting, and most of them makes total sense;;
ahh. I'm in South Kensington. moved recently from Hampstead;;
Fucking nemo... that was good  <@488734758847905803>;;
LUL. <@488734758847905803> 's autocorrect can get rated 18;;
Is it adult version?;;
it's the porn parody <@207416847019016202>;;
lmao;;
i 'accidentally' downloaded the wrong Spiderman movie once. and damn the costume was really brilliant.;;
Haha;;
So you can pirate in Europe?  <@300033838065778702>;;
I thought police will be at your door same day;;
no no. that was when i was back home. üòõ;;
i am now a reformed pirate <@207416847019016202>;;
Haha;;
I pirate movies. One of the reasons is that I have no idea where you can download or at least watch it for money;;
Somebody will say Netflix, but as I know they don't have all the movies, and I hate idea to have several stores and search in every of them;;
i have amazon prime and netflix so i watch from there now. but most of the time it is a matter of spending more time finding the right one to watch than watching;;
Amazon meaning you buy disks or is it online service?;;
yeah they dont have all the movies so that kinda sucks. but i like the series and documentaries;;
it's an online streaming like Netflix too.;;
so if you have Amazon Prime, you'll get the movies too. but then, some of them you'll still have to buy which kinda sucks;;
Let's say I want to watch last avengers. Any chance that Amazon or Netflix has it?;;
soon every channel will be online though;;
Disney is already pulling their stuff to release their platform;;
netflix, hbo, amazon prime;;
it's getting out of hand;;
i dont think the latest ones are available on the platforms <@207416847019016202>;;
So how would any one watch it?;;
Apart from movie theater?;;
I just trying to understand;;
probably have to wait until it gets released;;
Released where?;;
like on Amazon Prime, they let you buy or rent the movies online. so you can stream them;;
Hm... So it's almost year since movie came out and the only option to watch it on internet is to wait?;;
Torrents 1 - several services 0;;
it depends;;
i'll try to explain, but i will be right back;;
aight;;
Hey everybody just thought i'd slide my ever-growing dongle in and say Hi!;;
Hello  <@537319907541516311> once again;;
Hi <@207416847019016202>. Hope you have been dongling like theres no tomorrow!;;

pleasure to meet fellow dongle danglers üòÑ;;
I'm dangling like my life depends on it.;;
gotta dangle;;
Shame you can't dangle out in public. People don't like that. Especially outside schools (found out the hard way);;
hahahah;;
yeah, people don't respect our need to dangle;;
Its an addiction man. You wouldn't treat an alcoholic like that;;
lmfao dude hahaha;;
that was great;;
Just one dongle man, please.. I need this. Please!;;
but. but. i only have one dongle.. it's the levels that i can't get enough of üòõ;;
"You can find ""levellers"" out on street corners at night";;
lmao;;
This is Purple Mango with Mango Tree news, signing off;;
Peace out. Adeus;;

Good job <@!537319907541516311>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
hahaha damn that was perfect timing;;
damn i need to seek these so called 'levellers' myself;;
*types 'where can i find dongle levellers in London please* in Google;;

<@537319907541516311> i could do with being a lot lighter. no time for workouts Kappa;;
sad trombone;;
modern life as we know it man;;
8 hour work day;;
+1 hour commute;;

9 hours of gaming;;
<@488734758847905803>  - no time for dongling;;
lmao <@300033838065778702>;;
exactly <@537319907541516311>;;
i am fortunate to work from home;;
so, no commute time;;
Guys, just sell drugs. Self-emplyment is the way. Cinnabunz can also help with that üòâ;;
i used to commute 45mins one way before. now it is 10 mins walk;;
Thankfully I also live near to where I work.;;
you in the UK too? <@537319907541516311>;;
Yeah man West London;;
is that  how you know Cinnabunz?;;
Me and Cinnabunz, we go way back;;
oh cool. i'm in South Kensington;;
Nice. Some high-class levellers round there. lol;;
high class levellers charges way too high LUL;;
fuck i think we got London gang here;;
lmao;;
hooligans;;
which team do you guys support?;;
or are you not into football?;;
dont be afraid <@488734758847905803> , im still behind your back;;
we'd like to refer to ourselves as 'levellers' as i just found out;;
<@300033838065778702> supports MU;;
lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
<@488734758847905803> ;;
forgetting or dont reading facts about people since 1990;;
boooooooooooooo <@300033838065778702> Your team cheated against mine in '99;;
haha;;
mostly forgetting;;
<@488734758847905803> thank the referee LUL;;
Good job <@!300033838065778702>, your dongle just grew to 8!;;
is that better or worse <@207416847019016202> ? hahaa;;
look at my level 8 dongle;;
aww shit that girth;;
yeah. I presume you know what match i'm talking about tthen <@300033838065778702> ? haha;;
the same haha <@488734758847905803>;;
i like to keep up with chat and im trying to remember stuff about people;;
for sure hahaha. United and '99, anyone can relate üòÑ;;
by the way i also keep list of some of you guys;;
I actually prefer NFL, but UK team is Chelsea;;
so you root for bayern <@488734758847905803>;;
respect <@207416847019016202>;;
no. Palmeiras;;
it was Man Utd vs Palmeiras;;
NFL team is The Jets - Yes I know they are shit!;;
World Clube championship;;
club*;;
what the fuck is;;
palmeiras;;
a brazilian team;;
Brazilian team;;
best mofucking brazilian team in the wordl;;
is anyone gives a shit about them;;
i know them;;
but still;;
lmao;;
two goals annulled unfairly;;
feelzba;;
bad;;
i try to watch as much football as i can actually.;;
FYI - Palmeiras means palm trees in English;;
yep;;
20 years and it and <@488734758847905803> still feels the pain LUL;;
we used to be called Palestra Italia, but during the second world war they made us change it;;
yeah man;;
you know how hard it is for a brazilian team to win the libertadores and play the world club championship?;;
brazilians get robbed every freaking game;;
those argentinian, Uruguayan, and chilean teams man;;
wtf <@488734758847905803> i thought we were talking on here the whole time;;
lmfao <@160543395037708288> hahahahaah;;
Don't mention Uruguay;;
urg;;
or as Homer Simpson pronounces it... üòõ;;
They knocked Portugal out of the World Cup thanks to that goofy c*nt;;
lmao yeah i think of that everytime i read their name lol;;
aw damn;;
yeah;;
guys you are weird <@488734758847905803> <@300033838065778702> ;;
"1999, MU-Bayern 2-1, fucking legendary final, and youre saying ""everyone knows that when you say MU and 1999, its MU-Palmeiras""";;
WTF;;
at least you didnt lose 7x1 on home soil <@537319907541516311>;;
lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
gotta keep up with the times;;
<@488734758847905803> that softens the blow slightly.;;
palmeiras x mu was a great match as well;;
at first i thought it was that 2-1 final but it also reminded me of the Palmeiras game <@207416847019016202>;;
i follow footbal very closely, and no one fucking talks about that palmeiras game;;
<@300033838065778702> gets me;;
im just saying <@488734758847905803> ;;
"when you say ""everyone knows, 1999 and MU"", every sane european will think about Bayern game";;
legendary final with come back;;
perhaps mu supporters will think of both those matches;;
and europeans will focus more on bayern mu;;
it was 4am back home when i watched that game. i was 15 and i woke my parents up with my scream when those 2 goals went in;;
because europeans dont normally care too much about the world club championship;;
üò≠;;
"its not ""will focus""";;
nobody talks about that match at all, so i never heard about it;;
yeah i put two and  two together since <@488734758847905803> live in Brazil so I was sure his dongle meant the Palmeiras game üòÑ;;
lmao;;
but yeah, that game gets me in the feelz;;
gotta do some more work;;
peace out broskis;;
me too. and i forgot i was typing here. catch you laters donglers!;;
Later guys, off to see Cinnabunz and level all over her face;;
LMAO;;
<@488734758847905803> You've got to see the bigger cities in Belgium, when it's the world cup, man;;
Red, yellow and black EVERYWHERE;;

ah true <@524820041976250368> !;;
Indiana;;
Oh I'm sure everyone is gonna stay inside;;
Even the local schools were making the school busses in to make shift homes for the next couple days.;;
For homeless;;
Hm it's 27,7778 Celsius. Pretty harsh;;
-28;;
We only got 15-20 this winter;;
But last couple of days it's -3;;
-25????? my god this is over the top cold ...I don't even remember how 15 Celsius felt like;;
Not it's not over the top;;
It's matter of clothes;;
In some regions here most of the winter is at least -35;;
<@207416847019016202> we can't  all have super russian skins;;
lol;;
I have super tropical briefs when it gets to hot;;
i come from a tropical country and live in London. my mom wore a jacket when she visited me during the summer;;
The same for super Russian brains and other super Russian organs  <@488734758847905803>;;
where do you hail from <@300033838065778702> ?;;
Brunei. Southeast Asia;;
well, at least I have a brazilian dongle;;
And I'm not even started on super Russian dongles;;
oh nice, I want to tour arund asia someday;;
<@300033838065778702> and how was the weather when she visited you?;;
You should shamefully  put your Brazilian dongle away  <@488734758847905803>;;
brazilians are famous for having super dongles <@207416847019016202> , especially ones with italian heritage like myself;;
it was clear and sunny <@348165887347523594> but even though it was warm, it was still much cooler than where i come from;;
<@207416847019016202> boy, you must have some superhuman dongles....You guys may get get an extra meter if you come in a tropical country;;
typical men. always bragging that their dongles are bigger <@488734758847905803> <@207416847019016202> üòõ;;
Italian heritage? That explain your Italian accent when you trying to do Russian  <@488734758847905803>;;
<@300033838065778702> hahahaha, I figured;;
lmao <@300033838065778702> , yeah I do it to cover my lack of confidence;;
I pretend to be super confident;;
LUL;;
but actually my dongle is only leve 3;;
level&;;
***;;
<@488734758847905803> lol , now you're talking;;
You got it wrong  <@300033838065778702>.  <@488734758847905803> is actually bragging that his dongle is smaller;;
lmfao;;
He's a grower;;
Well, he was grower, but stopped at level 3;;
I hope 3 is cm;;
lmao;;
loooool;;
I wonder how it works when you move from a hot country to a very cold one, does the dongle get more compact but more dense ? hmmm I need to brood on this...GOOGLE will tell;;
We have many African football players here, I'm sure their dongles feels perfect;;
And Brazilian;;
<@207416847019016202> or are they?;;
it makes no difference <@348165887347523594> mine only grew when i joined this discord server;;
hooo man you're right <@300033838065778702> üòÇ , I'm finally able to show mine off, and it's only been like a month;;

<@348165887347523594> thanks! What games do you want to play? <@87241615671832576>;;
As of right now I am broke, so I have not really looked for any new ones lately. But I generally play anything which seems unique or interesting. So no BR or zombiegames in general or other molestated genres;;
I know the feeling lol. I want a few games but cannot afford them;;
guys, does anyone know if MSI is a good pc brand?;;
sorry to cut through conversations;;
but I have to decide rather quickly;;
quick google search says they have pretty good reviews but I have never heard of them and know nothing about the brand, sorry mango;;
Good job <@!416803598173995018>, your dongle just grew to 13!;;
Yeah, look at that dongle go!;;

true, true. I'm glad to hear it;;
that it's a good brand;;
not that you can't afford it <@416803598173995018> haha;;

Post it in pictures/memes and even self promo if you dlike;;

I did not notice I mention you haha. My bad üòÖ;;
Les me correct that right now;;
Done;;
You can't correct your mistakes in life  <@348165887347523594>;;
it's currently 11.52 pm here <@348165887347523594>;;
Ok ok hello mister <@207416847019016202>;;
<@409836692158021632> We are in your future then;;
And I'm in the most future;;
Yeah, you're a traveler , like the real thing;;
And I want to tell you guys - future doesn't look so good;;
hahahahahahaha;;
Future looks like russia;;
lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
yes! haha! Russia is the future!;;
I'm not sure I want to see the future then...cold ass future;;
Today is very warm. +3 I think;;
time to wear some shorts <@207416847019016202>;;
I speak in real people degrees by the way;;
Celcius;;
That is not too bad compare to what is happening in certain places around the world;;
haha real people degrees;;
If you're comparing +3 to some civir war or revolution then you're right  <@348165887347523594>;;
I haven't been in an environment under 5 Celsius for more than fifteen years.;;
Fuck that's terrible  <@348165887347523594>;;
You need to cool off some times;;
My skin got thin and weak;;
And I probably do need to cool off a bit;;
You might want to start by getting into the freezer <@348165887347523594> morning btw;;
lmao <@300033838065778702> , it'll be a good training environment for sure üòÉ;;
If it's too big of a leap, start from the fridge lol;;
im sure all martinique freezers have +30;;
its still colder than outside;;
lmao!!!! Actually, my bedroom is always at +18 or 17, I like to keep it cool in there .  I can't set it to any colder though.;;
Where do you live btw? <@348165887347523594>;;
Martinique, hot tropical place;;
Ah nice. I thought when <@207416847019016202> said martinique he was talking about freezer brands lol;;
ive never heard of such freezer brand lol;;
<@300033838065778702> hahahaha, ho my god;;
More for a hoven brand;;
Hahaha. Thank god for this discord server. Giving me good laughs lol;;
i hate idea of religions, but this discord made me believe;;
<@300033838065778702>  This is what I thought when I came here buddy, I love here üòÖ;;
I love it here too. First thing I do every morning now, is to try catch up on the messages here üòÖ;;
me too;;
not only here;;
in my others discords too;;
and the next thing to do now, is to check dongle growth. one sec;;
ahh still Asian 8 üòõ;;
dont worry, someday you will become african;;
but, but, I am happy with my Asian dongle üòõ;;
What a great message to wake up to <@300033838065778702> !;;
I'm really glad you like it here so much. I love having you and everyone else in here too;;
Well, <@207416847019016202> is meh, but what can you do? Haha;;
Jk my brother;;
<@524820041976250368> , I also meditate before bed. I use the headspace app, have you heard of it/ do.you use it?;;
good morning <@488734758847905803> yeah, i have found myself settling here very well indeed. <@207416847019016202> is the resident greeter. üòõ;;
Glad to hear that. ;;
Yeah <@207416847019016202> sleeps even less than I do haha;;
Dude is always around;;
Which is awet;;
Awesome*;;
i am pretty sure he sets his discord alert to max volume so he can wake up and respond to texts üòõ;;
Lol that's a good theory;;
Alright guys, don't forget tomorrow whoever is in 38th place gets a sub!;;
Every month I give my twitch prime sub to whoever is in a random rank. ;;
Three people say 1 number each, then 2 people say if I should add, subtract, multiply, or divide, and then the final sum is the rank;;
Chosen to get the gifted sub;;
i need to be silent for a while to reach 38th place;;
like.,FOR A WHILE;;
forever, more likely;;
lmao;;
yeah you would <@207416847019016202>;;
it's easier to wait for next month;;
and see if the number is betterrfor you;;
well its not high possibility that number 1 is gonna drop next time <@488734758847905803>;;
haha you'll never take my chair <@207416847019016202>;;
what I might do in the future is reset all XP;;
that what chicken would do haha <@488734758847905803>;;
lmao;;
that would give you a real chance to try to beat me;;
that would make me invincible actually;;
because now im behind you, and you had month before me;;
and i think its good to reset, its nice to have simple folk dongle;;
seems like im going at work trip in monday to St Petersburg <@348165887347523594> ;;
so you will HAVE to watch <@488734758847905803>  stream, sorry bro;;
<@207416847019016202> Ho noooo, I hate you;;
I know;;
thats terrible to ask friend to watch <@488734758847905803>;;
what could i do;;
Everything but that, you're telling to watch <@488734758847905803>'s streams man !!!!!???? wtf?;;
i know;;
im a terrible person;;
ill go kill myself;;
and i will make sure no one is aware;;
And take your god forsaken dongle with you!!! That big fat level 23 non stop dangling Russian dongle ....get out!!;;
as you could notice, <@488734758847905803> is intends to cut off my dongle;;
so i could grow new one;;
He is probably making a good decision. This cannot go on.;;
oh this could;;
üòÇ üòÇ;;
reset?! after all the hard work put into my Asian dongle?! üòõ;;
look at it from the bright side, next time you can grow it not asian from the start <@300033838065778702>;;
you can choose elephant;;
or whale;;
if whales has dongles;;
which i doubt;;
it's 2019. i can be anything i want. today i feel like being a traffic cone. so i will identify myself as a traffic cone today. <@207416847019016202>;;
okay, so today i will be brunei sultan <@300033838065778702>;;
can i?;;
its 2019;;
just for one day;;
hmm.. that is a title earned. i was talking about gender üòÑ;;
im pretty sure traffic cone is not a gender üòÄ;;
but if it is, so i sultan can be;;
if an apache helicopter is a gender than a cone sure is.;;
so its decided;;
how youve been today cone? <@300033838065778702>;;
today has been good. traffic is not too heavy thanks <@207416847019016202> üòõ;;
you know, some cones like it heavy;;
those perverted cones;;
yeah those are perverted ones. i prefer light traffic. so i can enjoy the sights üòõ;;
i know right, soft and tender traffic;;
with some road lube;;
lmao <@207416847019016202> , have to give the others a chance to grow new dongles too haha;;
LUL;;
lets not forget. when you cut off one fongle, 48 more will grow <@488734758847905803>;;
lmao <@207416847019016202> - <@348165887347523594> likes my stream;;
it's torture to ask someone to watch my stream damn hahaha;;
oh shit;;
he lies to you <@488734758847905803>;;
is that the hydra who does that in mythology?;;
üò≠;;
in russia mythology its 3 headed snake / dragon. when you cut off head, another one grow;;
;;
oh lol;;
cool pic;;
i see guy wearing beanie, i auto assume it is <@207416847019016202>;;
lmao <@300033838065778702> hahahaha;;
i like to know that youre thinking about me all the time <@300033838065778702>;;
that is one badass guy right there. 3 headed dragon is like probably trying to eat him and he's just standing there be like ' come and get me biznitch';;
Good job <@!300033838065778702>, your dongle just grew to 9!;;
ayyy thank you MEE6;;
actually half of russian fairy tales heroes are dumb, strong and lazy;;
"so hes like ""heh, dragon""";;
whatever;;
lmao;;
that's the most awesome thing i've ever heard;;
meh, I'm hungry.;;
actually;;
one of our most popular tales;;
when guy sat home 33 years;;
at stove, or whatever its called;;
and then he decided to go and be a hero;;
;;
that is interesting. a guy who just stays home for 33 years just one day said to himself 'fuck it. ima be a hero today';;
yeah;;
he was like, a very strong;;
but legs didnt move;;
and the russia was in danger;;
or actually not russia, Rus;;
it was back when Kiev was Rus capital, like 1100 years ago or something like that;;
so rus was in danger, and he went to save it;;
oh damn;;
how did he save Rus?;;
by his strength of course;;
i mean;;
did he fight an army;;
kill  a dragon;;
<@488734758847905803> Congrats on the 300 followers on Twitch;;
with his 2 friends (hes in center);;
thanks <@456226577798135808> ! I appreciate it;;
Sure thing;;
I can't believe i hit 300 already;;
Watching your interview with Jonny now;;
it's insane;;
oh cool üòÉ;;
he fought an army;;
Shared it on Twitter too;;
the hair on the horses. epic;;
its actually very famous russian picture, not random pics like 2 previous ones;;
thanks <@456226577798135808> üòÉ you awesome swamp dongle;;
oh really/;;
You're welcome <@488734758847905803>;;
<@207416847019016202> - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVbH1BVXywY;;
is it how Ivan 4 is in english? the terrible?;;
it is the terrible;;
didnt know that;;
actually in russia he is Ivan 4 fearsome;;
well, terrible is also kind of translation;;
but i would say fearsome more fitting;;
"I think ""terrible"" sounds more intimidating, but perhaps fearsome is more correct";;
they do another episode where it's just russians;;
for me terrible sound just like he was bad ruler and thats all;;
it's stalin vs rasputin, putin, trotsky and that guy with the winestain birthmark on his head;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT2z0nrsQ8o;;
my point is that russian original word dont mean bad in any way;;
that guy with the winestain birthmark on his head - gorbachev?;;
or sorry, not trotsky, it's lenin;;
yeah gorbachev;;
i had forgotten his name;;
you know a lot of russian rulers... i honestly dont know bout any brazilians;;
Pele is Brazilian;;
üòõ;;
neymar is president i guess;;
lmao;;
you're not missing anything honestly <@207416847019016202>;;
yeah he is <@300033838065778702> haha;;
but I dont like him tbh;;
he was a good footballer, nothing else;;
who? Pele?;;
he had no part at all in the fight against racism h ere;;
yes, pele;;
he never even tried to fight for the rights for black people here.;;
"and he even went as far as to say, ""I am a black man with a white soul""";;
why should he lol?;;
he does what he want;;
wow that sucks;;
he shoundt be anyone besides footbal player;;
he is football player;;
he is, but racism here is a big issue;;
black people were only good when they played football in the eyes of white people here;;
especially in the 60's;;
apparently hes not bothered by racism;;
he was until he became famous;;
i would not fight for right of people in orange beanies, as long as i would be untochable;;
I think it's important to fight for people's rights;;
it's their basic rights;;
and I dont mean that he should have quit his career;;
or anything like that;;
but he never even SAID a damned thing;;
rights, yes. especially when it comes to racism IMO;;
thats right, you think, you fight;;
pele dont think. he dont fight;;
i dont think. i dont fight;;
Good job <@!207416847019016202>, your dongle just grew to 24!;;
that was good message to level up;;
and catch up with <@488734758847905803>;;
but he suffered prejudice as a child;;
his parents suffered prejudice;;
his grandparents were slaves;;
i'm not saying you're wrong to think what you think.;;
but i disagree with you;;
it's a simple thing, right? for everyone to have basic human rights;;
of course everyone need to have equal rights;;
Howdy partners! How‚Äôs it going errrrbody?;;
hey <@537319907541516311> ! what's up dude?;;
hallo <@537319907541516311>;;
but you do realise that no one should be forced to fight for it? <@488734758847905803>;;
i dont want to be forced to do anything;;
and i won't;;
Everyone ok? <@488734758847905803> well done again for last night. Your beard stole the show. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
no one should be forced, but you'd think that the greatest footballer of the century would use his influence to at least SAY something;;
I am good, hbu <@537319907541516311> ? thanks man;;
hahah;;
yeah I was surprised at how many comments my beard got;;
Im good thanks. Have I joined at a bad time?;;
nah haha;;
well its what youd think <@488734758847905803> ;;
i dont think that any one obliged to use his influence in any way;;
Seriously it was well executed.;;
its 2019. so yeah <@537319907541516311>;;
I respect your opinion <@207416847019016202> , but I think that in this case, I disagree;;
The interview I mean. And the beard. But mainly the interview.;;
üòÉ;;
thanks dude!;;
i mean;;
they shouldnt be forced;;
you can say disagree as many times as you want, but it will not make pele obliged <@488734758847905803>;;
no law is oblige him;;
well, i dont like that argument;;
because in 18oo's  the law said you could have slaves in the US;;
youve started it;;
1800's;;
the law is not a reflection of morality;;
saying that pele is bad because he desnt fight;;
well okay;;
maybe law is not good point, i agree;;
but no one is obliged to anyone;;
i agree;;
no one is obliged;;
but I am not obliged to think he is a good person;;
of course;;
i dont think he is good person too;;
but i found your reasons to believe he is bad as not entirely satisfactory for me;;
you know Arshavin? <@488734758847905803>;;
im sure you know;;
I do know arshavin <@207416847019016202>;;
soryr, was taking a big ass dump;;
without my phone;;
why don't you think he is a good person <@207416847019016202> ?;;
Arshavin is one of Russia's footballers;;
so did you memorise all the ingredients in the shampoo since you forgot your phone? <@488734758847905803>;;
after russia failed at Euro 2012, some politician fuck started to pick on Arshavin at some hotel, where his team was training.;;
"and he said something like ""youve failed our expectations""";;
"and arshavin responded ""well, your expectations are your problems"", which i totally agree with, especially given that situation, and that politicians in our country likes to be loud about things that doesnt concern them.";;
but fuck, it became huge meme in russia.;;
agressive and negative meme.;;
"like"" what thet point to say something bad about national team, we all know that our expectations are our problems""";;
i try not to underline my opinion of people by some moral. im just sure Pele is a sick fuck <@488734758847905803>;;
haha;;
I did <@300033838065778702> hahaha;;
hm;;
I see <@207416847019016202>;;
Morning all;;

Nope. Just 27 followers  <@416803598173995018>;;

by that i mean that i maybe played it several days, even with break for vacation, but i didnt switch to other games;;
Ahh ok, Im not even sure how far I am in the game. My friend loves it, has beaten several times on the hardest difficulty;;

I feel like Russian is a difficult language to learn. Im good <@409836692158021632>, just want to get out of work lol;;
da moy brat! (yes my brother) <@207416847019016202> ;;
üòÇ;;
same same <@416803598173995018> this rainy day is perfect for staying at home and watching Brooklyn 99 or streaming!;;
ja mein bruder;;
haha thats good russian language lesson, continue it <@409836692158021632>;;
ahhh I wish, I almost called off work lol;;
correct me if Im wrong and excuse my ignorance but I though Russian used symbols (not sure what to call them);;
hahaha! a lot of people called out sick here at my office for Kingdom Hearts 3;;
cyrillic <@416803598173995018>;;
spasiba <@207416847019016202>;;
but its no problem to use transliteration;;
I don‚Äôt know any Russian;;
<@448648678224429068> feel no shame bro, we will work on that üòâ;;
Ok lol just teach me how to say I love you in Russian so when I go to my girlfriend I can say it and she won‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm saying;;
haha;;
<@409836692158021632> will teach you <@448648678224429068> , he is californian russian pro;;
haha wtf? ok;;
Lmao I wanna be able to cuss my coworkers out as well lol;;
ahh yes thats what its called <@207416847019016202> that would be tough to learn that. My translation app doesnt change it from that to letters.;;
do it mark way, just with english letters <@416803598173995018>;;
<@448648678224429068> Ich liebe dich is german for I love you, je t'aime is french;;
<@207416847019016202> ahh ok, I will try lol I have to work on my russian accent too;;
if you really want to improve your russian accent <@416803598173995018>  and be respectable russian pro, never listen to <@488734758847905803>  streams lol;;
scheissekauf is shithead for you <@448648678224429068> or dumkauf but that one is kinda obvious;;
I promise I wont lol. My accents are usually better but I only do them for friends so I wont lie, I felt under pressure and got nervous on the stream so they werent good;;
i usually do it for friends but you guys are no one for me so fuck off;;
when I want to tell my wife I love her in Russian I just tell her this...;;
<@207416847019016202> klyuch yavlyayetsya luchshim;;
(oneMansOrange's dongle is the best);;
üòâ;;
lol thats not what I meant! I meant these are people I have known for years and year so I am very comfortable around them. I am still getting to know you all;;
haha;;
"you just said ""key is the best"" <@409836692158021632>";;
dammit! failed again!;;
shame on you <@409836692158021632>;;
lol I love when translations are wrong;;
well, the Orange's dongle is a key to a whole new world;;
I know suka lol and thats it;;
i get it, you tried to translate word dongle? <@409836692158021632>;;
my friend is from russia and she speaks it very well but she only really taught me that word and hello, no, yes, goodbye and what not;;
"yes, Orange. I typed in ""dongle"".";;
suka is bitch <@416803598173995018>;;
lol yes I know. She only taught me a few words and that was one of them;;
its always nice to teach someone nasty words;;
lol yes it is;;
German is tough cause a lot of the words sounds similar to english, French is a little different;;
Spanish too;;
i love you in russian;;
ya tebya lublu;;
<@448648678224429068>  <@409836692158021632>;;

The power in my condo went out;;
;;
Oh damn my pic haha;;
oh damn...;;
No streamerino?  <@488734758847905803>;;
Only if the power comes back <@278571432588345345>  feelzfuckingbad;;
<@488734758847905803> rip;;
Np getting late for me anyways;;
<@207416847019016202> Yep, it's all about being productive my man;;
<@488734758847905803> Damn man, I know the pain. I have frequent power outages here too.;;
Productive  <@348165887347523594>? Not in my vocabulary;;
We ended up investing on a generator <@488734758847905803> . Don't know how frequent it happens where you are though;;
sorry <@488734758847905803>;;
<@498246547838992414> Productive just means being effective. Well doing lots of stuff concluding in effective results.;;
It's fairly rare <@348165887347523594>;;
First time it's happened in a long time;;
Ho, alright then, so there is no real reason to invest in it. Considering that generators have to be running once every so often .;;
<@348165887347523594> I meant that I'm not productive at all, Lmao üòÇ üòÇ;;
<@488734758847905803> Have you tried turning it on and off again?;;
<@498246547838992414> ho shit...lol, my brain is still not at ease yet hahaha....I'm still thinking like a robot.;;
<@348165887347523594> It happens, I have that as well;;
üòÖ üòâ;;
Hey all, do I play last of us again today or try red dead? Im leaning towards last of us;;

I'd go with what you want to play more;;
Hope my power comes back so I can watch you <@416803598173995018> !;;
<@416803598173995018> doesnt know what he wants more;;
The drugs or the fame haha;;
why not both?;;
wait how are you on here then mango? lol;;
4g;;
Mobile data;;
But watching videos would suck my data plan dry;;
same;;
i have 10Gb on mobile and its enough for me, but i dont really watch anything from phone;;
ahhh I see;;
I think I will continue last of us. I dont want to have to re learn the control for red dead right now lol;;
Haha;;
Yeah and rdr2's controls are BS;;

They are very much so;;

Lmao <@207416847019016202> , nah we didn't fix the power in all of Brazil hahahah;;
But now it's fine;;
Honestly, it might happen again at night because that's when most people are home from work and they blast their air conditioners;;
<@278571432588345345> I think I did. ;;
;;
It was a long story but in a nutshell, I was formatting it because I was going to trade with this guy, and give him some money back as his was better. ;;
But then he got all shady, got weird as fuck and I got the hell out of Dodge. ;;
But THEN my computer froze at 19% for like 3 hours;;
So I turned off the power;;
And my pin code was unavailable;;
And I couldn't remember my password to login to Windows;;
I hated when pcs does that;;
And I couldn't do shit about it;;
Just freezing;;
Yeah same <@207416847019016202>;;
None of my passwords worked;;
"Did you try password ""worldsmallestdongle""?";;
Then my wife tried my pin code anyway and it worked. Turns out my password was my oincod;;
Pincode;;
Lmao;;
It's unviersessnallestdongle;;
Good to know  <@488734758847905803>;;
I think it's a very long password for such a small dongle  <@488734758847905803>;;
I have to compensate somehow <@207416847019016202>;;
Yeah I got you;;
I love huge cars;;
Hahahahah;;

Well I would‚Äôve been done Wednesday but I messed up on one and had to redo it. Luckily I had only sewed on the flap. It‚Äôs taken at least a few days although I haven‚Äôt been steady at it. Like yesterday I just watched streams and chatted and did a drawing for someone. But I definitely plan on finishing them today!;;

I‚Äôm good, how‚Äôre you? <@416803598173995018>;;
Nice <@498246547838992414> Im very tired today <@524820041976250368> lol but good. Its Friday so almost the weekend for me;;
I'm putting my skills (or lack of) to the test and making an anime mango tree  <@416803598173995018>;;
That's awesome! I have zero artistic ability (outside of music if you can count that lol) so I can really appreciate skills like that;;
you have voice <@416803598173995018>;;
My voice is art? <@207416847019016202>;;

Welcome  <@361554595354509312>;;
thx dude ... some of u i know from jonnys;;
hey <@361554595354509312> ! thanks for joining us under the shade of the mango tree dude!;;
Hello!! Welcome and have some water.;;
Does anyone know how to add messages that will pop up on your stream chat for stream elements? I want one to say once in awhile something like, you can sub for free with twitch prime! I have no clue how to do that lol;;
Interesting dongle fact @everyone. Apparently, offering to show your dongle at a supermarket to prove u r old enough to buy alcohol, is not very well-received by staff and shoppers alike.;;
kids these days;;
the only thing my dongle was ever prove of is vd;;
lmao <@537319907541516311>;;
they didnt let you buy it?;;
<@416803598173995018> - do you use a chatbot at all?;;
I use streamlabs chatbot;;
I like it alot;;
a lot*;;
you can create what they call a timer;;
and it will go off from time to time;;
it's very simple;;
you need to create a new twitch user to be your bot though;;
Thanks <@488734758847905803> figured it out! I use stream elements, I just totally missed the timer section lol;;
haha true true;;
I didn't know about knew user thanks  <@488734758847905803>;;
haha;;
<@488734758847905803> no they didn‚Äôt let me buy it, so in the end I had to use my ‚Äòdongle discount‚Äô   Also, I‚Äôd like to add a chat bot and a disclaimer before people join the chat.;;
It turns out you're useful after all haha  <@488734758847905803>;;
Menu says it's beer with mango;;
good morning, Mangos!;;
Morning  <@409836692158021632>;;

Hi  <@481328139876827138>;;
Hey <@481328139876827138> how are you?;;
Happy February <@207416847019016202> & <@416803598173995018>;;
Haha thank you  <@481328139876827138>;;
np <@207416847019016202> üòÉ;;
Same to you! So far this year has been pretty good lol;;
üòÉ;;
mine has been a decent start... lots of school work but almost done;;
streams have been great tho and youtube channel is getting there. Still have a lot to learn such as creating thumbnail;;
Yeah theres tons to learn. I learn new stuff all the time;;
one of my good friends does my editing so that's a big help. I just do the recording and clips for socials;;
and gather/make the clips;;
Oh damn thats nice. I just ask people on discord what to do lol. Im so not good with this stuff so most of it is new to me;;
yea she was all down for it;;
Nice, that's a big help.;;
for sure cuz I didn't have the right editing source on my laptop;;
so <@416803598173995018> do you stream...youtube? or both?;;
Just stream on twitch. Eventually I will put clips etc on youtube but I dont have a capture card at the moment so its tough. I also have no clue how to lol;;
lol i gotcha i gotcha. im in the process of building a pc;;
been console player for a loooong time;;
Yeah same, I played some PC back in highschool but not much so I literally know almost nothing about them lol;;
followed <:PM:539114910211112995>;;
Thanks! Got you back;;
np looks like we both like fps & sport games;;
Dont play a ton of sports game anymore, once in awhile but gotta be in the right mood. Mostly FPS and RPG's for me;;
R6 Siege has been a favorite for awhile now;;
<@481328139876827138> im live if u want to come hangout;;
You can post it in live-now channel  <@312379820933906442>;;
That way it would be more noticeable for everyone;;
ok üòÉ;;
hey <@481328139876827138> üòÄ;;
Good job <@!409836692158021632>, your dongle just grew to 8!;;

Dongle police here;;

Dongle police would not be a fun job lol;;
Everything is fun if you add a little of Orange in it;;
Im not a fan of oranges lol. Only you;;
To be honest I hate all fruits and eat maybe one of them once a year  <@416803598173995018>;;
Maximum;;

Sadly it's more likely pineapple;;
lol same <@207416847019016202> I dont eat fruit hardly ever;;
Mango I just kill and sell;;

<@207416847019016202>;;

lmao;;
I had my chair lower yesterday;;
small defensless mango;;
so my wife could rest her elbow on it;;
hahaha;;
dont lie to yourself <@488734758847905803>;;
mango vs orange = mango wins every day;;
its not about the chair;;
purple is 2m hes just pretending;;
Good job <@!160543395037708288>, your dongle just grew to 7!;;
wooooo;;
growing big there <@160543395037708288>;;
mango wins? is it in your dreams or something? <@488734758847905803>;;
control yourself;;
my dongles already lvl 100 idk what this stupid bot is all about;;
my dreams?;;
<@207416847019016202> - I'm freddy krueger in this bitch;;
lmao, it docked  off points for ditching Stacy;;
you could have had a threesome with stacy and her mom, who's got it going on, btw;;
but then Mango raided;;
ditching stacy for you guys gave me 2093023932 xp;;
actually;;
hahaha;;
it gave you 100000000 rep;;
badassery;;
with her mom, oh god, even my jokes are not so nasty <@488734758847905803>;;
hahahah sorry <@207416847019016202> , but someone has to keep things classy in here;;
classy and short;;
*holds back tears and looks up at <@207416847019016202> while shaking fist*  you'll see one day;;
we will always will have 8 cm of misundertanding between us <@488734758847905803>;;
and im not talking about height;;
lmfao;;
well, you know what they say about short guys;;
they're reverse L's;;
not your case haha <@488734758847905803>;;
üòÆ;;
that's not what my gf's used to say;;
shes very kind person i see;;
by the way do you plan to stream with her in human time, and not when its 6 am for me? <@488734758847905803>;;
i meant wife;;
dont know all of your girls;;
I have no clue about this Anthem thing;;
What do you mean <@87241615671832576> ?;;
lmao yeah <@207416847019016202> - today we plan on streaming at around 20/21h our time;;
hahahaha;;
my ex's were horrible people most of htem;;
If I'm still up at that time, I'm a beast;;
I haven't slept yet;;
dude you going out yo mind;;
oh;;
you know what helps me ?;;
chamomile tea;;
thats good <@488734758847905803>;;
shit puts me to sleep like a baby;;
hahahaha <@488734758847905803>;;
here, our sleep meds are shit <@488734758847905803>;;
our bodies build up a resistance to sleep meds anyway;;
I feel the best method is to find a meditation or something that helps more;;
Exactly....I've been thinking about re-applying for the gym;;
It should help me relax at night;;
dude, that helps A LOT;;
really it does;;
yeah, it use to;;
when I had a hard time sleeping at the peak of my anxiety,;;
going to the gym helped sooooo much;;
yeah, no doubt. I use to go there 3 times a week. Than life, I had to stop for a time, and never went back;;
yeah, i know what you mean;;
but definitely that will help;;
eating habits also help, did you know?;;
Yeah, I have a pretty decent diet I think. I try to eat at the right time for most days;;
true true;;
And light food on evening;;
right;;
that's good to do for sure;;
eating heavy food before bed is bad;;
But the fact that I mostly work at home, and that I don't spend enough energy, plus my perpetual nightmares messes up   my sleep pattern .  I should take a step and do what's good...Get back to this freaking gym!!;;
<@488734758847905803> Yeah, I try never to do that true;;
yeah <@348165887347523594> - same here.;;
i sit on my ass 70% of the day if i dont go to the gym;;
that can't be good at all;;
It can't be healthy naaah, for real;;
A human being should spend energy and physically work everyday...I don't do shit;;
yeah, same here with me until a few months ago;;
It's been years for me...I did have some spikes but never lasted much;;
shit, i forgot to check who was at rank 38 yesterdayy;;
true <@348165887347523594> , then yeah man;;
even if you dont go to the actual gym,;;
do some pushup;;
pushups*;;
go for a wal;;
walk*;;
true true...at least;;
Going back to anthem...talk to you later  my dude üòâ;;
I'm gonna work those fingers out;;
it's <@481328139876827138> !;;
alright <@348165887347523594> ! enjoy it dude;;
talk to you later bruhda;;
what I meant <@348165887347523594> was I feel like the game should be for me. BUT those damn Javalns don't feel that great with mouse and keyboard;;
No it's not , all the mouse and keyboard users are unanimous , it sucks with it. It's a controller game <@87241615671832576> Unless you're willing to play it with a controller;;
I'm playing it with an xbox one controller;;
yeahh I don't like my shooters with controller;;
I prefer tose with keyboard and mouse;;
the worst is. I don't really care about anything in the game;;
why not <@87241615671832576> ?;;
Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone!;;
morning weak mark <@409836692158021632>;;
how was your sleep?;;
bad and insecure?;;
Haha yes so sorry <@207416847019016202> ;;
My sleep is always filled with self doubt, tears, and disappointment;;
Bad and insecure is when I take naps;;
hey <@409836692158021632> !;;
hahaahah;;
damn th ats some sad sleeping;;
if you ever will feel secure and confident, please come to my stream, i will fix that <@409836692158021632>;;
with an axe;;
he'll show you how insecure he is and then youll feel better <@409836692158021632>;;
Hey <@488734758847905803>;;
conragts to <@488734758847905803> to the second good joke of his life;;
haha;;
you know that isnt true <@207416847019016202>;;
i will count;;
you know that the main reason you like me is my hilariousness;;
it's my beast quality;;
sorry...;;
is it third? <@488734758847905803>;;
üòÇ <@207416847019016202> that's why I follow and watch your streams! I need to learn how to sleep with Big Dongle Energy;;
best* damn auto correct;;
haha;;
the important thing is to wake up with big dongle energy;;
its funny that several people always associate my streams with sleep;;
abssii, kelly, mark...;;
I always learn something new from each of the different streams here;;
abssii slept well listening to my voice, same for kelly;;
AM I THAT BORING <:PLM:539114906147094558>;;
From <@488734758847905803>, I learn that I am folicaly challenged and will never grow out a beard as beautiful as his;;
a dont forget wonderful game sucking lessons <@409836692158021632>;;
From <@416803598173995018> I learned that dick shots are more deadlier than head shots;;
And from @abssii I learned how to cancel dates;;
Hahaha <@207416847019016202>;;
remind me, what you learned from me? that america is doomed? <@409836692158021632>;;
I don't know <@488734758847905803>, there's not really anything. I kind of felt there might be something interesting with the story. But that show was over before it began üòÑ;;
i think they was pretty open about the fact that there wont be much on a story <@87241615671832576>;;
From <@207416847019016202> I learned that I shouldnt roll too many rrrrrr's when I do my russian accent;;
And that I need to invest in an orange beanie if I am to succeed in life;;
light green beanie will do too <@409836692158021632>;;
It's not a complaint <@207416847019016202> I just meant the story was the only thing which might have convinced me to get this game. But dues to the very short introduction I kind of lost interest;;
"yeah i understand, for me its the same, "" story was the only thing which might have convinced me to get this game"" <@87241615671832576> ";;
so i didnt plan on getting it exactly because i didnt anticipate story there;;
It does feel like they could put in a huge amount of story though. but the teaser is not really enough to keep me interested;;
they could, but they clearly didnt want to;;
they said several times before, that they want to concentrate on battle experience and bla bla bla;;
"its kinda official for ""dont expect good story""";;
I am also only talking about the story they showed in the demo;;
i understand;;
something tells me there will not be much more...;;
lmao <@409836692158021632>;;
ah true <@87241615671832576>;;
by the way, since i will not be home at monday due to work trip, i think i will stream more of new subnautica in 20-22 hours;;
found some nice locations;;
lmao <@207416847019016202> - guess you put eveyrone to sleep;;
<@488734758847905803> hahaha;;
üî•üî•üî•;;
Oh cool;;
22 hours hahaha;;
i do <@488734758847905803>;;
its my thing;;
Do asmr;;
Do asmr but read a Stephen King book;;
Oooooo;;
Though Stephen King imo is a very shallow writer;;
The only characters that he knows how to write is himself;;
Who do you like for writers <@488734758847905803> ?;;
Hence why the shining is one of his best;;
I like George rr Martin a lot;;
Ah yes;;
He's my personal favorite;;
<@207416847019016202> ;;
Pls do ASMR readings of the Game of Thrones;;
Patrick rothfuss;;
1. i will not read that shit (no hard feelings);;
2. i will not google that abbreviation again (i got bored first time i did that);;
Hahaha;;
Hahahaha;;
I don't know what asmr stands for;;
But it's amazing to sleep;;
I think it means Ass Mr. (Butt mister);;
Hahahs;;
if i lie down, i turn off in less than a minute;;
Lucky yoy;;
You*;;
Ah, we found Orange's weakness;;
what is it? you have to put me on couch? <@409836692158021632>;;
and i will sleep?;;
We make you Google the meaning of asmr and you get so annoyed you lie down and sleep;;
maybe i should google it at stream;;
Hahaha;;
I'm still hoping you do the Orange podcast;;
i will, but imm too lazy to do it, some one need to be initiator and organizer;;
Life advice, life lessons, how to NOT cancel dates from <@207416847019016202>;;
how not to be good enough even for having dates haha;;
Good morning all you lovely people!;;

i vote for voice haha;;
Haha yeah mark is a better person. My vote is still for voice though;;
Haha...ah...thanks, I guess? ;;
Ok back to crying in the corner ;;
üò•üò•üò•;;
We still love you <@409836692158021632>;;
Well I do. I don‚Äôt think <@207416847019016202> can feel love;;
Haha thanks...I'll show my family this message and tell them this is what it's like to show ‚ù§;;
Lmao;;
<@207416847019016202> has no feelings. Only smashes things, feels no pain;;
i can feel guys;;
but usually its hunger;;
Ahh only hunger. The hunger to smash puny Americans;;
exactly;;
you can feel guys;;
do you like feeling guys?;;
<@207416847019016202>;;
i like feeling guys;;

But do you really sleep <@207416847019016202> or do you just plug into a chamber somewhere like a Tesla?;;
when i say i go to sleep i just log in into discord and twitch under another account;;
Ahhhhhh;;
Duly noted, comrade;;
Go to sleep = Ignore Purple Mango;;
you got my motto wrong;;
"its just ""Ignore Purple Mango""";;
üòÇ;;
üö´ ;;
No Mangoes beyond this point;;
Good job <@!409836692158021632>, your dongle just grew to 9!;;

The Orange side;;
Orange Team;;
Do not claim victory yet;;
I'm coming fast behind;;
behind is key word;;
<@348165887347523594> Here comes a new challenger!;;
A true challenger;;
<@348165887347523594> will chop down all the Mangoes and Oranges and build a new beach house;;
<@207416847019016202> soon, I won't even know what this word means;;
<@409836692158021632> hahaha, this is what I'm good at...;;
if you will start forgetting words, it will not be good, because you need write messages to level up <@348165887347523594>;;
Hahaha;;
Fair enough , fair enough;;
I need more popcorn...;;
This is getting gud!;;

there is so many better ways to use dongle, you know;;
I'll be content at that point sir;;
Nothing else counts;;

https://giphy.com/gifs/reactiongifs-LRVnPYqM8DLag;;
i think i finished all what early access could  offer to me;;
in terms of story;;
Did you gey any vehicles  <@207416847019016202>?;;
no, did you?;;
Nope :(;;
i googled about that show fox;;
wiki page says its upcoming;;
*snow fox;;
A little disappointing;;
yeah;;
stupid me thinked game is finished;;
i thought early access is just for polish;;
you know, bugs and everything;;
but it turns out you just got a little slice;;
but i want to say, new creatures are very cool;;
Did you get attacked by any new ones?;;
well yeah, by average one who looked agressive;;
but those big wonderful creatures - they are friendly;;
and they are very cool;;
its cool just to watch them;;
Yeah scared my socks off;;
and i loved that crab thing;;
There were so many;;
Thought I was fucked;;
I havent seen any other leviathans;;
yeah, i hope there wont be any;;
Lol;;
There WILL be;;
You knoe;;
am i right - cold mechanics are not there yet?;;
Yup;;
kinda strange;;
you make ice spin off;;
first thing you need to introduce is cold mechanics;;
imo;;
but they just dropped couple of items related to cold;;
I'm sure it'll come soon;;
Good job <@!278571432588345345>, your dongle just grew to 10!;;
i hope;;
mee6 seems to be agreed with you;;
how did you feel about new approach to character? <@278571432588345345>;;
first one didnt have character personality at all;;
it was not clear, who he or she is, etc;;
and here you have person, and voice;;
Yeah digging it so far;;
More dialogue and interaction;;
yeah i loved that very much too, i never like when character is silent;;
and i can say., story so far is very intriguing;;
and i would say, unexpected;;
for me at least;;
Yup;;
Its good;;

Sleep is good, I'm really tired myself;;
Had a hard day, went hiking in the ardennes today, but I made the mistake of not wearing sunglasses, because my eyes can't handle the reflection of the sun in the snow, so basically I walked the entire trail with bad eyesight;;

jonnys going to be streaming everyday every hour üòÑ;;
hahaha;;
do you know what games you are going to play <@278571432588345345> ?;;
God of war roarrrrr;;
lmao god of roar - Basil, 2019;;
how was your flight <@207416847019016202> ?;;
and how is st peters?;;
or are you so ahead in the future that youre coming back already?;;
Everything good. Just had full day at work art clients side, and now I'm done with work and have 24 hours before flight. I'll head to the nearest subway, then to hostel, then me and my gf will walk around downtown  <@488734758847905803> <@348165887347523594>;;
This face is reminder to  <@409836692158021632> that he should not get relaxed;;
Weather is shitty by the way;;
As always in st peteraburg;;
Rain with snow;;
<@278571432588345345> cant wait to catch your streams!;;
thanks man hope to not disappoint üòÉ;;
lmao <@207416847019016202> - watch out <@409836692158021632>;;
dont get too comfortable;;
take pics of the city orange and send them to us;;
i wanna see;;
Pics is especially shitty today, because of all that wet snow.  But we will try tomorrow;;
I would probably die out there  <@207416847019016202>;;
Isn't London the same? Always without sun and with Rain?  <@278571432588345345>;;
Well we stay at 0 or -5;;
That is death in your pic;;
I told you metro 2033 is real Russia  <@278571432588345345>;;
Lol yeah;;
But you know, I said snow with rain, it means that today was near 0;;
-1;;
It's like usual st petersburg shitty way;;
Many people actually can't live there because of weather;;
Not because it's cold (cause it's not), but because it's fucking wet and depressing;;
And amount of sun is even less than in moscow;;
I think st petersburg kinda associates with Russian london;;
Set up live notifications for you <@278571432588345345>. Hopefully the time difference wont affect it too much, should be able to tune in most days;;
awesome;;
guys, do you have any suggestions for the stream today?;;
I'll be going live in about an hour and i can't decide what to play;;
dark souls 3 <@488734758847905803>;;
I dont have ds3;;
üò¶;;
I was thinking of buying that KH bundle and doing a stream of all the kingdom hearts;;
leading up to 3;;
and then by the time i'm done with that the huge hype around 3 will have died down;;
Do it! Kingdom Hearts Bundle!;;
Id watch that <@488734758847905803>;;
all right then, cool.;;

You can always not answer the phone lol üòÇ;;
"<@287320205020102667> True true, and some times I don't...problem is ....""money""";;
Right. Money motivates the world;;
God damn money...we can be all we want to be but still a nobody without it;;
Same, discord and streams is what keeps me up but I‚Äôm loving it! Especially getting to talk to amazing people! <@348165887347523594>;;

Exactly what you just said <@524820041976250368> üòâ I live on a small island and being able to speak to great people from around the world is priceless. when I'm here, it feels like I'm traveling.;;
What is kh? <@488734758847905803>;;

thanks for that respect <@207416847019016202> , my dongle just grew a few milimeters;;
Oh wow that‚Äôs awesome! And same here talking to all these amazing people around the world does feel like I‚Äôm traveling! Although I live in Texas wouldn‚Äôt mind living on an island tho! <@348165887347523594>;;
Hey! <@488734758847905803>;;
When I was living in Florida, I was craving for some Island life....I came here in Martinique...Now, I've been here for too long and can't stand life on an island anymore. I think that we all need constant changes in our lives to stay happy and motivated.;;
Morning;;
morning <@459504171113250837> how are you?;;
Indeed Kelly it's not easy to evolve as an individual if you never experience new stuff.;;
Good job <@!87241615671832576>, your dongle just grew to 7!;;
Morning mango folks;;
Like a tree we rise;;
I don't want a big dongle maaaan;;
Morning Sagmth;;
So now it is few millimeters? <@488734758847905803>;;
<@87241615671832576> true;;
exactly <@87241615671832576> , that's why traveling is so important imo;;
hey <@508094590436507668> !;;
like a tree we raise indeed;;
hahaha youre too awesome <@87241615671832576> ! your dongle is growing;;
now it's .5 millimeters <@207416847019016202>;;
<@87241615671832576> embrace your dongle, one day when the mangos will be kings of the world, there will be a big battle of the dongles....We shall brandish our dongles like swords when this day comes;;
lmfao <@348165887347523594> omg;;
Haha you guys and your dongles. If you ever come to my Inn I'll give you all a pot where you can relax your dongles.;;
"It will be called ""The war of the dongles under the shade of the humongous mango tree "" in history books";;
you have to start writing books man that was creative af;;
<@488734758847905803> should I? ü§î ...üòÖ;;
that was creative for sure;;
üòÉ;;
That emoticon sucks;;
Who the hell smiles like that;;
hahaha;;
people who are high;;
üòÇ üòÇ <@488734758847905803> so true;;
<@348165887347523594> yeah I agree we do need constant changes to stay motivated and be happy, are you thinking of moving again? And morning! <@459504171113250837>;;
I've been working on trying to move to Canada in a year or two...It's never an easy thing to do though;;
I can't really travel while I have small kids. But I travelled a bit in my start twenties. It might come back when they grow up.;;
Yeah it‚Äôs not an easy thing, when I moved back to Texas it wasn‚Äôt the easiest transition like I thought it would be, I hadn‚Äôt lived here since I was 12. I came for summers but it‚Äôs not the same as actually living back down here. But I do enjoy it, it‚Äôs just been a hard transition especially trying to get a job. <@348165887347523594>;;
And I don‚Äôt get to travel like I would like to but maybe one day. <@87241615671832576>;;
You see, I don't have kids and it's the number one thing that makes me sad...Yet, I realize the freedom I get from not having anyone to take care of but me. <@87241615671832576> Sometime I wonder if it is part of why I haven't age much since my twenties;;
<@524820041976250368> I lived the same thing when I moved back to Martinique. I was just so different;;
I totally have aged since I got kids.;;
I hear you haha...I've seen how it changed some of my friends....not in a bad way though...And I feel that I stayed behind.;;
I got mine young, so I'll be in my mid 40's when they are grown up. The perfect time to travel and get my worldview shattered.;;
Very true haha;;
<@348165887347523594> definitely know the feeling. I wish I had my own kids. But at the same time I‚Äôm finally living my life for me. I was taking care of my nephews for the past 13 years loved every second of it but never really got to live my life as a child so still trying to catch up. Now they are back with there dad and since they moved back to Texas as well I get to see them when I want to;;
Sounds good you can life your life aswell <@524820041976250368>;;
And see the people you love;;
So don't you feel like that time is given back to you? Do you feel a bit like a kid? This is how I feel. I don't really see some of my best friends anymore because I feel so childish around them.<@524820041976250368>;;
They have kids and responsibilities I don't have;;
Btw Kelly where do you live? I have only heard you live on an island;;
the island of Lost;;
moves every day;;
explains his sleep schedule;;
lmao <@278571432588345345>;;
Haha;;
<@87241615671832576> Martinique;;
I have to look that one up;;
it's a tiny island very small;;
It's so small it's literally only  <@348165887347523594> and his dongle;;
Morning everyone;;
So who all played Anthem? What were your thoughts? Be honest;;
Out off Porto Rico?;;
Morning  <@456226577798135808>;;
Morning;;
I did. I had seen huge problem with the controlling. But I will not really judge before the release;;
<@456226577798135808> I played the fuck out of Anthem and I totally loved it;;
I even did some coop with <@278571432588345345>;;
I enjoyed it. The flying controls were a bit awkward but I overcame it.  I hope they eventually have more Javilins than just 4.;;
I didn't have the time to join for any unfortunately;;
"<@207416847019016202> üòÇ üòÇ ""me and my dongle""";;
"<@456226577798135808> If the world is ready to give them a fear chance...This game could be ""THE"" game";;
Not completely given back but I do feel a bit like a kid again. Ever since I got into watching streamers and chatting in discord my life has completely changed, I‚Äôm a lot happier, I feel more connections than I‚Äôve ever felt before. I‚Äôm more talkative and not still stuck in my shell like I use to be. Yes things still get tough but I‚Äôm a lot more positive about life. Definitely has been an eye opener for me. <@348165887347523594>;;
I felt the voice acting was hit or miss but it didn't bother me too much. Like there were certain parts when talking to NPC's it sounded like they were dropping a deuce in the bathroom and doing voice recording work and then boom it would go back to sounded normal on the next clip;;
<@524820041976250368> Same thing here;;
<@524820041976250368> Connections are def important for sure;;
I tell ya what really opened me up, getting on a damn camera.;;
Seeing and hearing myself has been uh interesting to say the least;;
"<@456226577798135808> Yeah, it did annoy me too....But we have to look at it like, this is probably the only ""destiny  or division"" game that pretends to have a deep on lasting story that will keep us engaged....I'll take it for what it is if they deliver on what they promised";;
But the connection aspect of talking games with folks while streaming has been fun as hell;;
<@348165887347523594> Excatly;;
As long as they can provide hours of pleasure, I am all IN;;
This is why hope the gaming community won't kill this one and give it support;;
ya, there has been a lot of hate towards Anthem;;
some salty bastards out there;;
lol;;
Haha my life has changed too since i joined discord. Can't say that I became happier, because I already was. But I definitely hate more people now than before, just because I know more of them;;
Thats not to say I can't be overally critical of some games myself but damn, this game is punching some folks in the sack for some reason.;;
I've seen so many games getting shut down because of youtubers and the community. I believe that BO4 came out without a campaign because of us....Year after years youtubers and people would bitch about the campaigns not meeting there needs.;;
<@456226577798135808> connections are important for sure! That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm super glad I‚Äôve joined in this community full of wonderful people! You all are amazing!;;
This discord thing has totally changed my life in many aspects;;
Same here <@348165887347523594>;;
Its interesting, sometimes I wonder due to certain games, have we become spoiled as gamers. Do our expectations outweigh reality.;;
Good job <@456226577798135808>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
Oh damn, my dongle just got bigger;;
<@456226577798135808> We are spoiled;;
<@456226577798135808> Get bigger pants;;
The Dongle of Donk.;;
haha;;
hahaha;;
We are ruining the game industry;;
"How about Donk's Dongle a new series of ""its whats down below, that really matters""";;
lmfao;;
üòÇ üòÇ;;
Donk's dongle sounds fine;;
Sometimes I kill myself;;
But yea, sometimes I think we expect too much;;
Too much sense of entitlement;;
After years bitching about cod's campaigns, well we got what we asked for;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 19!;;
On the other side of it though, devs and publishers need to be transparent. They shouldn't promise shit they can't provide;;
The Dongle Growith;;
<@207416847019016202> and <@488734758847905803> should start worrying;;
haha;;
You don't have a D in your name for nothing;;
lol;;
hahaha...kellydongle for the vips;;
"Not to msitake with Kellydongled .....its ""kellydongle""";;
Hold you dongle firmly so you don't get dongled;;

When it gets that way I just close it and don‚Äôt go back for a while;;

Lol there is some really good players and people in it I mean you have to try out just to make it in the actual discord;;
There are some players in there that are super super good <@448648678224429068> that you haven‚Äôt even seen yet;;
O I‚Äôm sure there is;;
But yes <@348165887347523594> most there have a very dark and twisted sense of humor;;

<@409836692158021632> big let down lol;;
Haha we'll see. Maybe Apex is still good without it;;
Oh yeah im sure it will be. It looks great from the streams I was watching;;
i aprecciate how you guys miss me <@488734758847905803> <@409836692158021632>;;
i just slept for 11 fucking hours;;
its more than before in whole my life;;
Duuuuude...it's not a myth! You DO sleep! Haha;;
Good job <@!409836692158021632>, your dongle just grew to 10!;;
now its 8am and we going to find some food;;
How‚Äôre you? <@207416847019016202>;;
The hunt is on!;;
im good thanks <@524820041976250368> , how are you;;
Pretty good, just sitting here eating ice cream and meditating lol <@207416847019016202>;;
<@409836692158021632> is definitely thinks that russia is some kind of Hunger Games;;
and ill go get some of street food i posted yesterday in pictures;;
<@207416847019016202> sleeps?!;;
Morning  <@416803598173995018>;;
I thought he just had a test mode like the ps4;;
Mainly Orange eats;;
Lol just doesn‚Äôt eat oranges;;
How is your trip so far comrade?;;
I leave hostel right now, and got 8 hours before heading to airport;;
Got any plans?;;
Maybe some museum shit;;
It's-3 but I'm feeling fucking cold;;
I need to eat to warm up;;
Orange gets cold too? Didn‚Äôt think it was possible;;
It depends on my hunger level;;
Recently I felt very warm in -15 after good lunch;;
Yeah, me, I usually feel colder when I'm tired....I take it as a sign when I'm colder than usual;;
Sup  <@348165887347523594>;;
If you just woke up and go outside, it's fucking cold;;
But after good lunch it's often warm;;
Don't matter what weather;;
Yep, true, and the temperatures you're talking about are really cold though. To me the worst is that time between the moment you finished taking your shower and when you dry yourself. I remember it being horrible.;;
<@207416847019016202> And hello bro, hope your trip was enjoyable;;
Yeah;;
I'm warming up in a food court right now, and then will be out in a cold;;
Dropped couple of cold pics in photos;;
Hope it will turn you on  <@348165887347523594>;;
I'm just 2 days away from home, but already can't wait to stream tomorrow (Wednesday). For now I kinda struggle between the games, so I open to suggestions:;;
- subnautica below zero (I'm done with early access story, but it's no harm to just gather resources and craft our island base);;
- ATOM RPG (after 40 hours spent in game, we are not weak girl anymore. We are weak girl with strong companion, who gives headshots on right and left);;
- TES Legends (card game can be very good choice for just chatting, if anyone will show up of course);;
<@207416847019016202> I'm not sure about subnautica. Maybe to many are streaming it right now and it really doesn't hold my attention. You'll have to see what the others think. I'm still down with ATOM .  Maybe you could show us TES legends.;;
Okay good, your opinion in this discord worth 10 times, so possibly now we are between TES Legends and ATOM;;
<@348165887347523594>;;
If you have Astronner <@207416847019016202> It's comming out soon;;
What kind of game is it?  <@87241615671832576>;;
Astroneer;;
https://store.steampowered.com/app/361420/ASTRONEER/;;
yup gonna play the shit out of that;;
Hm I think I saw  <@278571432588345345> played it;;
I wasn't much interested;;
Do you think I'll like it?  <@278571432588345345>;;
tbh I don't know man, I really liked it;;
I  remember I said its like no man's sky meet subnautica;;
Maybe I'll try it;;
7 bucks for me;;
So I just tried Apex Legends, and let me tell you, I suck;;
I don't even understand what I have to do;;
"This is the problem when I try to get into those battle royal games...It's overwhelming and there is no time to learn . It's just kill or be killed. In my case more ""be killed""";;
Can you elaborate, what is this apex legends? <@348165887347523594>;;
Is it that titanfall spin off that was released while I slept?;;
It's free on origin. Battle royal game;;
I've heard people talking about titanfall but I don't know why. I see no similarities.;;
Oh ok, I checked my brother's morning message, it says titanfall universe;;
Did you try out the training <@348165887347523594> ?;;
Iused it first and it was quite good;;
By the way,  <@348165887347523594>, is titanfall 2 on origin? If it Is, what access do you need to play it?;;
yes it is <@207416847019016202> available with the basic origin access;;
<@87241615671832576> I tried the training yeah...But seems that there are lots of things I'm missing that the tutorial didn explain;;
ohh Okay I got more or less everything;;
Good, I will buy basic as I wanted  <@348165887347523594>;;
And I will play titanfall 2;;
Many people advised it because of story;;
I really enjoyed it...It had a great campaign;;
Hm..;;
I was surprised since the first one didn't have any;;
Yeah;;
Should I stream it or it should be private erotic  experience? <@348165887347523594>;;
You should stream it...and have some private erotic moments on the side;;
Okay I will üòÇ;;
good day guys;;
hello Nor;;
hey <@193534318704852993> !;;
what's up mango seeds!;;
im doing good;;
after watching <@278571432588345345> ¬¥s review of your channel.... man the energy levels you have when you stream üòÆ;;
Going to have fun in Apex tonight?;;
hahaha - I enjoy streaming a lot. Also, when unleashed, I talk soooo much;;
Unleash the mango;;
hey <@87241615671832576> , is there like a free demo or something on console?;;
OMG;;
I am going to start using that;;
You Brazilian/Spanish/English genius boi;;
Apex is for free on Origin;;
Lol its a good hashtag  <@488734758847905803>;;
PC only tho which was his maon question I think;;
ah feelzbad;;
yeah that'll be my hashtag;;
from now on;;
yeahh it was. I would wonder if it would be a good game to have fun together in;;
props to <@278571432588345345>;;
Making history;;
A game I'd love to play with friends on stream is gauntlet legends;;
on ps4;;
#unleashthemango;;
#UnleashTheDongle;;
UTD;;
lmao;;
nice <@87241615671832576>;;
at one point I might get a console;;
to be honest with you guys, i never thought the dongle jokes would make it this far. glad to see dongles are still funny;;
apex is available on all consoles and pc already;;
I feel <@278571432588345345> is getting a bit tired of them though hahaha;;
or have I misunderstood;;
I was there when the dongle showed up first;;
oh is it <@193534318704852993> ?;;
yup;;
oh <@278571432588345345> saw the origin, the birth;;
That fateful hitman stream;;
the uprisal;;
lmao;;
and in RE2 there's a moment where it's said as well;;
Seeing the birth of a dongle is not very pleasant experience I'd say;;
lmao;;
are you playing on ps4 <@193534318704852993> ?;;
no pc <@488734758847905803>;;
sad trombone;;
Sad mango more likely;;
hahahah;;
From now on, we ONLY play games which are cross console!!!;;
hahaha sounds good to me <@87241615671832576>;;
but our options are limited to Rocket League I think;;
Yeahh i think it something like that. i'd say growth we'll be up hill;;
Hello mangos;;
Just got out of a very fun session of Apex Legends.... And I SOCK!!;;
You can be what ever you want, but sock???  <@348165887347523594>;;
"yeah you heard it ""SOCK""";;
The good thing, the person I was playing with was as bad as I am...so we had a blast;;
You were pair of socks;;
exactly üòÇ;;
But problem is.... You were both left  <@348165887347523594>;;
Which is worst haha;;
I managed to finish at third place though on one game session. I found a neat little hiding spot and  camped there for until there was no one alive;;
Cool. I downloaded Apex last night to give it a try. Just haven‚Äôt had a chance yet.;;
Sounds like some good fun to be had;;
Yep;;
Let me know when you'll get to play it <@456226577798135808>;;
Will do. I have a podcast tonight but hoping I can get some time in after.;;
üëåüèæ;;
Hello @everyone I need exp to beat <@416803598173995018> so that's why I'm saying hello;;
You can say hello only once a minute  <@498246547838992414>;;
Hello  <@207416847019016202>;;
Hello all;;
<@207416847019016202> and <@!498246547838992414> I think both of you are great people.  Now say thank you <@348165887347523594>;;
Thank you  <@348165887347523594>;;
hhhmm damn, it didn't work;;
<@488734758847905803> seem to have a busy day today. Haven't seen him much;;
Hell O;;
Hell O's are Satan's cereal;;
Fuck you  <@348165887347523594>;;
And thanks by the way;;
yeah, I am having a crazy busy day haha <@348165887347523594>;;
sorry bout that guys;;
I am doing some Pele wokr;;
Fuck... Are you trying to kill him?  <@488734758847905803>;;
lmfao;;
I was playing hitman as training <@207416847019016202>;;
Oh ok;;
So pele is not in danger  <@488734758847905803>;;
Judging by your skills;;
Daamn  <@207416847019016202>;;
Tea, spilt;;
lmao <@207416847019016202> - i had to throw you guys off so as not to be suspicious;;
I bet pele will laugh too  <@488734758847905803>;;
hahahahahahahahahaha;;
üòÇ;;
*fights back tears* nice burn bro;;
You should try dongle joke, maybe it will kill him  <@488734758847905803>;;
My flight is on so I'll see you in a while guys;;
ok <@207416847019016202>;;
have a nice flight dude!;;
Thanks;;
I spent the entire morning getting my ass kicked at Apex...After all this time I'm not getting any better;;
hahahaa;;
is the game like rocket league for me ?;;
no matter how much i play i dont improve haha;;
Hahaha, yeah, same thing here at rocket league <@488734758847905803>;;
Could be, I was not good either. But I am crap at shooters anyway. The only thing I have a some sort of accidental game awareness.;;
I use to be really good at Halo...I think that I still am;;
But Battle Royal games I just can't get any better;;
But I have a big problem though that may explain it all;;
On console, I manage to not suck entirely since everyone plays with controllers. On pc, I play with controllers also, and I believe that most pc players use mouse and keyboard which brings me to a serious disadvantage.;;
That's very true, especially if there's no auto lock stuff on it.;;
Yeah, I try to focus more on my mobility, but aiming isn't that great with the controller.  On console I don't feel this weak though.;;
rocket league is hard stuff man.;;
It shouldn't be that hard, it's more that people got too damn good;;
the physics in it are hard af;;
the camera control;;
The stuff I've see them do;;
yeah it's amazing;;
I lost my xbox copy, I have no idea where it went....I've been thinking about going back to it...but feels bad to buy something twice..especially since I'm not that good at it. But it's a fun game to play regardless of your level with friends;;
Good morning my comrades!;;
Hello <@416803598173995018> , it's noon here, but I'm still on my bed;;
Morning <@416803598173995018>;;
Lol 0818 here so I am just waking up. Not feeling great today so I took a sick day off. Morning <@87241615671832576> and <@348165887347523594> how are you both?;;
I wanted to show you guys how my internet setup works now that it's almost stable. As you can see there are 3 lines...Ethernet is my regular adsl line and the two others are 4g modems. Speedify is a channel bonding service coupled with a vpn server. Which allows me now to get speeds that I could've never dreamt of before. Sometime I get up to 60mb/s .;;
<@416803598173995018> I'm good buddy, I hope you'll feel better very soon.;;
Damn thats pretty neat. I wish my internet would stable out lol. I have great days and then awful ones;;
What kind of internet do you have?;;
I've been struggling like hell to finally get something decent...but what I got know is pretty expensive. I now have 3 internet line plus I'm paying for the vpn to  merge them;;
true that <@348165887347523594> ;;
I wouldnt bother buying it again since we'll soon be playing some GEARS OF WAR;;
also, damn <@416803598173995018> , hope you feel better soon;;
<@488734758847905803> hahaha, can't wait;;
Cable modem and I plug in direct with an ethernet. The company just sucks;;
I am doing good <@416803598173995018> it's almost evening here. So we prepare the kids for bedtime;;
Remind me where you are at <@87241615671832576>;;
<@488734758847905803> gears of wars used to be my game. Man I would spend hours playing that!;;
I've had cable internet with comcast back when I lived in Boca Raton. It was great at first, than less than a year after they arrived the services started to worsen;;
Yeah I have spectrum now, pretty much the same lol;;
I forgot, do you stream kelly?;;
Chocolate is the best thing ever! Hope everyone is keeping well! That is all üòÇ;;
lol agreed <@486507510635823104>;;
Not yet...I've been working on my internet for that...I'm thinking about giving it a first try by the end of the month <@416803598173995018>;;
<@486507510635823104> haha, have a great day;;
Denmark;;
hey <@486507510635823104> ! how is everything?;;
<@416803598173995018> same here. I played the first three with a friend here in brazil;;
shit broke my heart in 3;;
hahaha;;
Ahh very cool! I will definitely watch if you stream. I just realized a problem I would have if I move my set up, wont be able to get an ethernet connection. Right now I am on my tv in the living room but I wanted to eventually get a monitor, capture card etc all that and move it upstairs to the office but there is no internet connection up there except wifi. Damnit;;
<@87241615671832576> very nice, hope tp visit there someday!;;
hell yeah <@348165887347523594> ! can't wait for tht stream;;
lol <@488734758847905803> I honestly cant remember what happens;;
<@488734758847905803>  apart from the morning sickness that lasts most of the day ...I'm good üòÇüòÇüòÇ you? üòä;;
Sounds good <@416803598173995018> We have a very open home, so there's always a place to stay;;
<@416803598173995018> There is the death of a very important character;;
morning sickness that becomes all-day sickness <@486507510635823104> ? sorry to hear that;;
hope it goes away soon;;
<@416803598173995018> , can you run a cable to the office?;;
Thanks <@87241615671832576> ! See, thats why I love Europeans lol. I really need to get my citizenship in Germany and move;;
yeah <@416803598173995018> the US is whack right now;;
<@488734758847905803>  some days it's just morning other days not so much üòÇ but it's ok joys of being pregnant üòÇ;;
<@488734758847905803> would be tough, we dont own, we rent so cant drill holes or anything;;
haha;;
ah damn <@416803598173995018>;;
that blows;;
set it up in the living room perhaps?;;

Unfortunately not, I will have to come up with something;;
<@348165887347523594> - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-ZblMfZpuw;;
check this out;;
No one gets that kind of speed where I live....I'm pretty proud to see my effort finally rewarded .;;
I can help you if you want <@416803598173995018> - i also had to do a bunch of work arounds;;
That would be great when the time comes, there has to be a way to do it I am sure;;
<@488734758847905803> I love that channel ...watching that battle right now haha;;
Nice <@348165887347523594> that's awesome;;
wow <@348165887347523594> , that's not bad for what you told me.;;

it is, I had a lot of fun with <@526319824704634881> this morning. We were getting our asses kicked but got some nice legit laughs about it;;
looks like a tough game tbh;;
but looks fun and something you must grind to get good at;;
which i enjoy;;
Morning  <@312379820933906442>  <@416803598173995018>  <@486507510635823104>;;
i'm trying hard to get better lol;;
how are you doing today? <@207416847019016202>;;
Congrats on your painful, expensive but quick internet  <@348165887347523594>;;
I'm good, my plane just landed  <@312379820933906442>;;
It didn't crush, sorry to disappoint you guys  <@416803598173995018> <@409836692158021632>  <@488734758847905803>;;
well thats always a good thing;;
i love flying;;
good morning, everyone! I hope you're all doing great!;;
#unleashTheMango;;
<@348165887347523594> I suck at Apex so bad! At least I'm very consistent with dying;;
Stability is a good thing (c) Putin  <@409836692158021632>;;
haha <@207416847019016202>;;
I'm watching <@278571432588345345> review of the Mango-nator's channel right now...;;
Ou yeah;;
#unleashthemango;;
loving it so far <@278571432588345345>;;
Cheers man;;
Wus' poppin' Logaaaaang;;
Time for my daily name change;;
Yo;;
<@278571432588345345> I really love the review video! Great suggestions and recommendations (especially the audio ducking one)!;;
And your overall tone was very nice and genuinely helpful!;;
Liked and subscribed, sir!;;
üëè üëè üëè;;
You made my day  <@409836692158021632> thanks! <a:raresiren:467242552425447425>;;
If you would like it I'd gladly do one featuring your channel;;
I loved it man! it was very detailed but done beautifully without hurting <@488734758847905803> 's feelings. you know how some streamers can get...;;
JK! it's a great series!;;
haha please NO!;;
I only stream from a PS4 and I have tons of audio issues...;;
and audience interaction issues...;;
and general suckiness issues...;;
do <@160543395037708288> next (if he's ok with it...);;
When youre rdy bro;;
of course man! that's the goal, to have a good channel!;;
I asked <@160543395037708288> but he didnt respond so I assume he's not interested;;
he's too cool for school haha;;
but it's a great series!;;
I am disappointed <@207416847019016202>;;
lmao;;
naw im good ‚ù§;;
<@416803598173995018> ;;
here are my first impressions of Apex Legends;;
1. the drop sequence is soooo cool (probably even cooler than Blackout's imo);;
2. teamwork via voice comms is definitely needed to survive and win;;
3. wall running isn't really needed;;
4. finishers (finishing moves) is a great touch for killing off downed opponents;;
5. matchmaking pace is quick and fun (as compared to PUBG where it could take minutes for a match to start);;
6. shooting and overall control feel is ok but could probably be a bit tighter;;
It's definitely a great 3rd option battle royale for those who don't want to deal with Fortnite's building mechanic and want something better looking with faster matchmaking than PUBG;;
Don't cry  <@416803598173995018>, I'll die next time;;
lmao <@409836692158021632> , me too very consistent at dying. There should be a reward for that;;
Very detailed review  <@409836692158021632>, especially since  <@348165887347523594> 's review was SOCK;;
hahahaha....I SOCK pretty badly that's all <@207416847019016202>;;
It's my first real battle royal experience...I tried fortnite once and stopped as quick as it took me to turn run on the game...I'm too far behind to learn it and that building stuff is just too much. Matchmaking is indeed very fast.;;
dude, I got all the SOCKS last night üò©;;
"<@526319824704634881> called it a ""Death Simulator"" coz of all my dying";;
I was basically testing all the different ways you can die in Apex;;
so far so good!;;
10/10 will die again;;
<@409836692158021632> that‚Äôs awesome! Can‚Äôt wait to try later today;;
Can't wait to die later haha;;
So, Orange is almost finally;;
All I need is exit this taxi with this fucking stupid driver;;
And after that I'm home;;
Will there be a parade in your honor for your return?;;
If anyone is interested in seeing Apex gameplay, <@160543395037708288> is playing it now on his podcast channel;;
I saw he was playing with Karak.;;
Game looks legit for a FTP;;
Hope everyone is having a fantastic Tuesday!;;
<@456226577798135808> ;;
yeah man! it's crazy that it's free;;
heya <@524820041976250368>;;
I just made second place with one kill !!!!! gg to me!!! üòÖ;;
That‚Äôs awesome! <@348165887347523594> congrats! And how‚Äôre you? <@409836692158021632>;;
Parade in my return will be on my stream tomorrow  <@416803598173995018>;;
Hi  <@524820041976250368>;;
Hey! How‚Äôre you? <@207416847019016202>;;
I'm good, just got home from work trip;;
Aw <@207416847019016202> 's plane didn't crash? Haha;;
#unleashthemango;;
Ah true that <@312379820933906442> , sorry to take so long to answer, had a lot to do;;
And yeah <@278571432588345345> 's review was awesome;;
That‚Äôs awesome! <@207416847019016202> glad you made it back safely!;;
"hahaha ""work trip""";;
you re the only one who glad <@524820041976250368>;;
I'm very glad you're back <@207416847019016202> ;;
VERY GLAD;;
so you can clip me into little pieces? <@409836692158021632>;;
Orange can not be clipped;;
Orange is invincible;;
Orange is life;;
good admission essay for Team Orange <@409836692158021632>;;
Lol <@207416847019016202> cant wait to watch!;;
hahaha;;
i didnt decide on a game;;
maybe i should make a pole...;;
so russian hackers could help;;
Well I‚Äôm most definitely glad your back home! <@207416847019016202>;;
Good job <@!524820041976250368>, your dongle just grew to 8!;;
damn <@524820041976250368> that's a pretty big dongle;;

Congrats on you dongle <@524820041976250368> . It's a beautiful dongle ...feels weird to say that...But there is beauty in dongles after all;;
Haha thanks! <@348165887347523594> and yes there is!;;

Pretty good, a bit irritated right now but all is good!;;
How was your work trip? <@207416847019016202>;;
good, first day i worked, second just walked through the city <@524820041976250368>;;
I bet that was awesome! Where did you go for your trip? <@207416847019016202>;;
St Petersburg <@524820041976250368>;;
Oh that‚Äôs awesome! What kind of work you do? If you don‚Äôt mind me asking <@207416847019016202>;;
usually im a programmer, but this trip was more admin-related, i just needed to set up some things at clients computers;;
Oh wow! That‚Äôs great!;;
man what a day i've been having workwise;;
holy crap;;
it's not the company i usually work for, so I've  been extra pressured to do a good job;;
you got this, Mango!;;
That good or bad mango?;;
<@409836692158021632> playing some apex now. Just makes we wanna play titanfall 2 lol;;
I trust he does <@409836692158021632> , there is no stopping the man called <@488734758847905803>;;

haha yeah it kinda reminded me of titanfall too <@416803598173995018>;;

Lmao nah thats always fine. Aiming in apex lol;;
hahahaa;;
as Confucius once said;;
Good luck Kelly;;
Aim dongle is easy as aim in Apex;;
Lmao;;
It‚Äôs a cool game though;;
TRUE;;
i dont like shooters much;;
Jump sequence is bad ass;;
I love shooters lol. I love all games;;
haha;;
lemme rephrase;;
I like shooters, I just suck at them;;
Lol fair enough. This is one is tough so far;;
<@416803598173995018> the Respawn devs said they're working on more Titanfall for the future so...;;
there's still hope!;;
That‚Äôs awesome. Too bad EA owns them now though so I‚Äôm very skeptical lol;;
This game is cool though. Especially for free;;
Love the no fall damage;;
haha yeah. no fall damage is great!;;
Damnit! My team just came in 3rd lol so close;;
Wasn‚Äôt the game just released yesterday?;;
yeah yesterday at noon;;
Wow. The guy who killed me already has over 100 kills;;
He has way too much time to play lol or is really good;;
hahaha;;
I have 1 kill lol;;
Jump sequences and even picking operators is really cool though. Gets me hyped up lol;;
You gonna be on later?;;
I will be! I'll DM you when I'm on;;
I suck really bad tho so you're better off playing with randoms;;
üòÇ;;
lol dude I‚Äôm bad too;;
I have 2 kills so far;;
Hope everyone is having a wonderful evening!;;
<@409836692158021632> I should be on around 630;;
You too <@524820041976250368> !;;
<@416803598173995018> got it!;;
Thank you! <@416803598173995018> what you gonna stream?;;
hey <@524820041976250368>;;
God damn, I can't get anymore than one kill...but I still love it;;
You‚Äôll get better the more you play! <@348165887347523594> and hey! <@409836692158021632>;;
‚ù§;;
@everyone you guys definitely have to download apex it‚Äôs awesome;;
damn. Shadow of the tombraider is going to be on gamepass this month;;
guess who bought it when it came out and never even FUCKING PLAYED IT?!;;
I got it;;
My first and only match played I got a win;;
üëÄ;;
I haven't had a chance to check it out yet, though I don't really like shooters in general;;
Hopefully it makes out better then fortnite;;
<@488734758847905803> I pre-ordered Fallout 76 so I could play in the beta and got to play it 3 times before release because of the crazy beta schedule;;
then it was on sale like a week later, and it came out in Novemember  and is already super cheap;;
damn that makes me feel better <@314733038854602752>;;
haha;;
but still. it is frustrating;;
i feel for you though dude;;
how is that game doing anyway;;
?;;
I enjoy it and it still has a pretty good player base;;
So, surprisingly well for how much people hate it;;
wow that's good to hear haha;;
I am not that big of a fan of fall out games in general, so i didnt really get hyped up about it;;
and was pretty much out of the loop as to why people hated it so much;;
<@524820041976250368> not streaming today but will be back tomorrow probably with some apex;;
That‚Äôs awesome! Can‚Äôt wait! <@416803598173995018>;;
I try to get the multiplayer games my friends buy cause we stream/record them together;;
ah true that <@314733038854602752>;;
My friend does fallout camp builds for his youtube channel;;
Good job <@!314733038854602752>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
So I help a lot with decorating and camera work in the game, and building amazing looking basses;;
ahh;;
does he stream at all?;;
<@488734758847905803> your the bomb bro;;
Morning sleeping seeds;;
Good morning! <@207416847019016202>;;
*hello*  <@207416847019016202>;;
Wow you still awake  <@524820041976250368>;;
Don't hide from yourself, I know it's you crim  <@498246547838992414>;;
Haha yes! <@207416847019016202>;;
What are you doing? Supporting someone?;;
Supporting/mod‚Äôing;;
Banning people? I love it;;
<@207416847019016202> I'm not crim, he sounds handsome though;;
So far I haven‚Äôt had to ban anyone yet lol but I definitely love being a mod! <@207416847019016202>;;
Haha it's only sound;;
That's good  <@524820041976250368>;;
Yes!;;
I'm sure you will ban someone someday!;;
Morning everyone;;
Morning  <@87241615671832576>;;
What's up for today?;;
For sure! Lol <@207416847019016202> and good morning! <@87241615671832576>;;
Usual work day is up for today, and after that I'll be streaming something;;
Sounds good, what will you be streaming?;;
Since I will not have much time to install and test new games, today it will not be astroneer and titanfall 2, so choice is between ATOM RPG and elder scrolls legends for now  <@87241615671832576>;;
Ahh okay :);;
Though, maybe it will be new...;;
I have all day ahead and team viewer to install...;;
Ahh true, well Apex is the hot new thing. But I wonder if it leaves a gap somewhere.;;
Hey everybody in the stream summary email, what does top referrer mean?;;
hm i dont have that one <@537319907541516311>;;
i will definitely not check out than Apex game haha <@87241615671832576>;;
It‚Äôs at the bottom of the stream summary email and says Snapshot Top Referrer.;;
The reason I ask is coz apparently my top referrer says Dr. Disrespect.;;
i just read my summary email, it doesnt have one <@537319907541516311>;;
Thanks <@207416847019016202>   I am so confused.;;
maybe google it;;
apparently no one disrespects me yet;;
Goodnight everyone talk to y‚Äôall when I wake up!;;
gnight <@524820041976250368>;;
Nighty night <@524820041976250368>;;
@everyone i will be very obliged if you will go and vote for a game that i should stream today, even if you will not be there;;
https://www.strawpoll.me/17376867;;
All suggestions that i had aside from this list, i will play a little later;;
<@207416847019016202> voted mate.;;
Good job <@!537319907541516311>, your dongle just grew to 5!;;
Thank you so much <@537319907541516311>;;
Ooooh look at me dongling!;;
right now i see subnautica wins;;
poor <@348165887347523594>;;
if it wins, it will be definitely last stream until new content will come out;;
<@488734758847905803> he does stream but it's more to record the content than to entertain. (Sorry I got distracted by youtube) if we play together I stream. But the last time I streamed I started the 100 baby challenge on sims 4 so I might continue that today.;;
what is 100 baby challenge  <@314733038854602752> ?;;
you need to born 100 babies?;;
or kill them?;;
Yes, by different fathers;;
I don't think you can actually kill babies in the sins;;
Sims;;
mother should be the same??;;
Yeah, if she becomes an elder the youngest daughter takes over when she becomes a young adult;;
https://snarky-sims-witch.tumblr.com/post/181535303038/tos-i-am-the-original-writer-of-the-sims-4-version;;
interesting <@314733038854602752>;;
i almost never played sims 4;;
It was fun to stream lots of home wreaker jokes;;
do you post here on live-now channel when you strem? <@314733038854602752>;;
No im really bad at announcing it;;
The only place that auto does it is my discord server;;
it would be good if you did it here;;
morning everyone;;
morning <@300033838065778702>;;
how are u;;
ayy <@207416847019016202> i am good. how are you?;;
me too;;
cant wait go back to streaming after two-day work stream;;
nice. yeah i havent been streaming since Saturday so i might stream tonight üòÑ;;
same;;
please be kind sir and vote;;
https://www.strawpoll.me/17376867;;
if you dont care, click anywhere;;
i sure will üòÑ;;
done and done;;
thanks üëç;;
no problem;;
Subnautica;;
I did a poll like that, but it was should I pick a popular game, a game just for fun, or a game at random;;
hm i should have said there that its new subnautica;;
good idea too <@314733038854602752>;;
Even better;;
I own almost 1500 games on steam so sometimes it's hard;;
thing is im done with its early access content;;
i meant not that i dont want play early access;;
i meant that i played all that new subnautica can offer;;
Start over on hard core and ride some whales;;
what you mean by ride?;;
i met those whales;;
You can ride the glow whales;;
hm that means i can ride them in my non-hardcore game;;
what should i do for that?;;
just get closer?;;
Im not sure, I don't have it. I saw it on a let's play and he tried it because people told him he could.;;
So just swim up their backs he grabbed on towards the end of the head almost to the face;;
hm;;
i will definitely try it;;
but not on hardcore, i hate any kind of challenge haha;;
thanks for the tip;;
My son is like that, he hates playing minecraft on survival;;
well you know, survival is one thing, hardcore survival is another;;
"i never try ""creative"" mod in games like this, because i understand that game was meant to play on survival";;
but anything harder is not for me;;
Right, I play hard until I get frustrated;;
I did that today in the binding of isaac, I ended up losing right before I beat it so I decided it was time to lay down;;
yeah, i hate so much idea of losing any kind of progress...;;
did you play first subnautica?;;
It's official. I've bought Astroneer.;;
My poor wallet;;
I did, I do still it's a super relaxing game;;
I saw that but I'm trying to figure out my job situation so astroneer has to wait :(;;
Makes sense;;
Good job <@!87241615671832576>, your dongle just grew to 8!;;
did you beat it ? <@314733038854602752>;;
Not yet, I haven't had time to play it that much;;
I watch let's plays during work and listen to them so I still know all the lore but it lets me enjoy the game at my own pace;;
hm;;
i usually watch games that i finished or that i will not play;;
but still, i never watch, only listen;;
Sometimes I watch video games I want to ensure it's something I would enjoy;;
So I don't waste money;;
Its 333am I need to go to sleep :(;;
gnight <@314733038854602752>;;
for me its otherwise;;
sometimes i watch to ensure that i dont need that shit;;
for example, anthem and that new battle roale;;
Right, if I can watch a let's play and still be excited to play it then I'll pay the money but I tend not to watch things that are just to remind me how much I dislike it;;
yeah, usually i dont watch anyone;;
only guys from discord;;
and girls haha;;
I have people I lurk but life keeps me busy so it's not often I just get to watch and interact;;
same;;
morning guys!;;
what's up <@207416847019016202>;;
hey <@314733038854602752> ;;
oh, i guess you're sleeping;;
Greetz <@488734758847905803>;;
hey <@!498246547838992414>;;
what's up?;;
I was and then my phone kept buzzing. Night;;
Good job <@!314733038854602752>, your dongle just grew to 5!;;
Good morning mangos. Hope everyone's day is going well üòâ;;
<@488734758847905803> Just got back from school, I have another project for friday, but I'm gonna do it tomorrow, and BS the entire thing;;
morning <@488734758847905803> , welcome back from apex <@348165887347523594>;;
Haha, good morning bro, getting ready for your stream?;;
yeah;;
since you here guys, help me with the pole too (kelly won't like results);;
https://www.strawpoll.me/17376867;;
Fuck these results...The pole is rigged;;
i myself was very suprised too;;
hey <@348165887347523594> !;;
dont worry, it will be the last time i play subnautica before they will make new content;;
what project is it <@!498246547838992414> ?;;
Sup <@488734758847905803>;;
ah sorry about that <@314733038854602752>  haha;;
I voted for subnautica <@207416847019016202>;;
just doing some of the last bit of work;;
ok <@207416847019016202> , we will get many more occasions to get more Atom;;
exactly;;

You probably know mine;;
she knows Jonny,;;
she knows <@!498246547838992414> , even though he changes his nam e all the time;;
my real first name would make <@409836692158021632> run away scared;;
haha;;

Its Vladimir;;
<@!498246547838992414> , I don't recall your first name.;;
like Putin;;
üòÆ;;
<@488734758847905803> I had it as my twitter name for a while;;
I only saw your twitter as Unoriginal Name;;
I hate my name lmao;;

<@488734758847905803> No;;

<@207416847019016202> - that is a crazy cool vampire name;;
I like the name Vladimir;;
It's cool;;
why  vampire? <@488734758847905803>;;

<@488734758847905803> üòÇ üòÇ;;
maybe there is such a book, i dont know <@488734758847905803>;;
oh shit <@!498246547838992414> was right about vlad the impaler;;
Alright boys...I need to get my brain ready for that meeting. Talk to you later my loves;;

Stick it deep;;
<@!498246547838992414> A plus tard mon ami;;
its not how its working in russian language;;
Vlad is short for Vladislav, so there s 0 connection between Vladimir and Vlad.;;
Short for Vladimir is Vova (dont ask me why, theres no reason);;
Interesting;;
People always in elementery school called me Milkyway idk why;;
there are actually several forms for each name in russian;;
well not forms, but slight variations;;
What's up with all the Oranges? üòÑ;;
<@87241615671832576>  <@207416847019016202> is now the supreme ruler of this discord server;;
haha;;
im trying to kill mango;;
XD;;
huh;;
*hitman assassination*;;
hey <@87241615671832576> !;;
good thing I am good at avoiding death;;
(that's actually true ^);;
I should have died at least 5 times already;;
like, major disasters or situations;;
oof, that's not fun;;
not even joking this time;;
It makes for great stories now that I'm older though haha;;
apparently i hired very bad hitman... apparently its mango himself;;
Glad you're alive though;;
lmao;;
thanks <@!498246547838992414> üòÉ;;
It's been a while since anything like that has happened to me, coincidentally when my life was quite a mess;;
it was before beard i guess;;
the last thing that happened was when my plane got caught in a storm and had to emergency land in a rural airport, but they had told us to prepare for impact;;
haha <@207416847019016202> , I have had this beard since I was 15;;
so all of them were actually after the beard;;
<@488734758847905803> that shit scares me;;
yeah it was messed up too;;
i saw your band video, there was no beard <@488734758847905803>;;
I had shaved it <@207416847019016202>;;
I wasn't even supposed to  be on that plane;;
i was supposed to be on the one the following morning;;
but I managed to get on an earlier flight to surprise my wife;;
but then it ended up being the worst thing ever, because i had to land 3 hours away from my city and take a cab;;
also, almost died haha;;
That's some harsh stuff right there;;
i dont know, 3 hours in cab sounds a lot worse than dying;;
XD;;
I've never had a taxi ever;;
hahaha;;
Way to expensive over here;;
i had yesterday and i hated the guy;;
3 hours in a cab sounds really expensive. Like seel you kids kind of expensive;;
i had 3 hours cab once, for work;;
it was 120 bucks or something like that;;
it is very expensive for cab here;;
but it was 200 km;;
so its okay;;
You'd pay like 50‚Ç¨ to go to a neighboring city lmao;;
usually cab in moscow is 6-8 bucks,;;
haha;;
yeah;;
but my company paid for it because it was a business trip thank god;;
it was like 450 BRL;;
right now that's 110 USD;;
I guess a trip like that would be about  a 1000$;;
in Denmark;;
üòÆ;;
exactly, for me it was too 110-120 and my company paid <@488734758847905803>;;
<@87241615671832576> that's a lot;;
Cabs are expesive. for 7 Km I pay around 53,38$;;
I never use cabs;;
3 hour cab here is a fucking salary;;
yeah apparently its one of very few things that is cheaper in russia;;
Less than an hour is like 150;;
<@87241615671832576> Same here;;
well <@348165887347523594> , wouldn't 3 hours drive around the entire of martinique?;;
<@87241615671832576> I think between 800 and 900 euros at least;;
<@488734758847905803> No lol, maybe 8 hours;;
haha true true;;
now i realise where all those stories about russian cab drivers cheating tourists comes from;;
apparently they just give you your usual price guys;;
haha;;
Cabs here are usually for trips to the airport. We have taxi busses which are a lot cheaper;;
trip to airport here 15-20 bucks;;
yeahh, that's how thay are all over the world. The italians are also doing that thing;;
we also have special trains called aeroexpress, but if there 2 of you, its already cheaper to take taxi;;
We have tramways, which are the cheapest of them all.;;
tramways to airport? <@348165887347523594>;;
No, not for the airport ...but for other destinations;;
We have drunk guys who carry you everywhere;;
well in city destination is one thing, metro in moscow is the best for it;;
hahahaha <@!498246547838992414>;;
but for trip to airport its taxi/aeroexpress;;
Yeah makes sense <@207416847019016202>;;
every airport is about 20-30 km from moscow downtown;;
"i looked at my pole now, and whats interesting, first place holds option where i said ""mango sucks""";;
people are drawn to your failure <@488734758847905803>;;
I want to buy some lego games idk why;;
There's a steam sale going on, right?;;
hahaha;;
well, I guess maybe the other games just didn;t interest people <@207416847019016202>;
I dunno <@!498246547838992414>;;
don't really look at steam usually;;
Okay, so I'm thinking, Lego the incredibles, lego DC super villains, and Just cause 3 flopped on top?;;
no no, im sure its about your failures <@488734758847905803>;;
OOOOOOHHH;;
The Just cause collection is on sale;;
you should try that apex game <@488734758847905803> ;;
everyone says they constantly getting killed in it;;
94‚Ç¨ to 14‚Ç¨;;
OwO;;
lmao;;
nice <@!498246547838992414>;;
<@207416847019016202> , respect the dongle master;;
or I shall reset your dongle to 0;;
DO YOU HEAR ME?;;
haha jk i'd never do that;;
Idk if I'll get it though since I completed 3 on ps4;;
haha no point to reset, you ll still  be second;;
or even 56th <@488734758847905803>;;
in YOUR DREAMS ORANGE;;
besides, I didnt say i'd reset myself;;
I said i'd reset YOU;;
haha;;
that would be the day i started considering having my own discord <@488734758847905803>  üòÄ;;
and then doing epic-steam exclusivity thing;;
Hahahah;;
i actually think it's flattering that someone has more exp in my own discord than I do;;
It just means that someone has even less of a life than you XD;;
Haha. Most discord owners apparently thinking the same, Since they silent there  <@488734758847905803>;;
hahaha;;
lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
I'll give you a run for your money though;;
I want that throne back;;
Dongle throne;;
Sitting on dongles isn't for me;;
I'll leave that seat for <@207416847019016202>;;
I decided to buy Kingdom come deliverance and a few rocket league cars, with the money I had in my steam wallet;;
Throne has inner space, where you can place all dongles, so you don't have to sit on them  <@488734758847905803>;;
The biggest dongle sits on the throne;;
Morning everyone!;;
oh I see. i was unaware <@207416847019016202> since I am no longer the owner of it;;
hey <@524820041976250368> !;;
Hey! <@488734758847905803> how‚Äôre you?;;

Okay thanks!;;

@everyone - I will be selling my elgato hd60 for $100 (USD) if anyone is interested.;;
I will be in the States in May, and I can send it to you then;;
No problem! I‚Äôm trying to watch but twitch is still acting up on my phone for some reason;;
sad trombone <@524820041976250368> üò¶;;
It‚Äôs done jumped up another 4gb of data used since last nightüòÇüòÇüòÇ now I‚Äôm at 174 used <@488734758847905803>;;

Yeah on mobile data. ever since the glitch on my phone yesterday everything doesn‚Äôt seem right. My limit is 60gb or they can shut down my data if they want to;;
oh damn;;
is your wifi not reliable?;;
No the wifi here sucks;;
feelzbad;;
It‚Äôs okay, my data will restart in a couple days;;
but still. iw ouldnt be able to live without good wifi;;
though, that's why I have a low data plan;;
Lol my phone usually does pretty good. I finally got the towers switched yesterday so I get signal better. But I did notice when it switched everything was working faster and then it poofed and quit working properly;;
Morning  <@524820041976250368>;;
Yeah I made few modifications as new owner  <@488734758847905803>;;
oh i see <@207416847019016202> ahhaa;;

Glad to hear üòä <@488734758847905803>;;

Yes I am;;

That new game apex;;
Good job <@!99527682106085376>, your dongle just grew to 1!;;
oh cool;;
That game... I am to old for that thing g;;
haha same i think <@87241615671832576>;;
I like Apex but BR games bore me after a bit. I think cause they are so frustrating. You spend all that time gathering weapons, items etc and then die and have to do it all over again;;
I just play for the laughs and fun some entertaining;;
This morning after 2 hours, I've only had one kill <@416803598173995018>;;
And we tried hard;;
Just got a key for Euklidian skies aswell. So I am very interested to see how it is;;
We where Tryhards <@348165887347523594> I felt I needed a shower afterwards. That's how dirty I felt like;;
hahahahahaha <@87241615671832576> ...I'm speechless it's so true;;
I got a win with 0 kills lol and my teammates left lol at the the beginning lol <@348165887347523594>;;
haha, yesterday I ended up multiple times second with zero kills as well  <@99527682106085376>  üòÇ;;
Haha <@348165887347523594>;;
A true pacifist run. How did you manage?;;
<@348165887347523594> it‚Äôs definitely not an easy game at all;;
Think im up to 2 or 3 kills and I played for about an hour yesterday. Got 2nd place in my 3rd game though lol so not too bad;;
dobroye utro <@416803598173995018>;;
morning <@99527682106085376>;;
Hey hey;;
<@416803598173995018> 2 or 3 kills in an hour is what I dream of in a whole day;;

<@193534318704852993> I read chiropractor as velociraptor and was super confused lmao. I‚Äôm very tired this morning;;
Haha she can be üòâ;;
<@207416847019016202> It handles it pretty well;;

Can you add media to your messages?;;

Ok it was great to see everyone I'm gonna go play some apex;;
Good job <@!516763409417764865>, your dongle just grew to 1!;;
Wtf is dongle;;
does anyone here know anyone or have experience using the surface pro dial with photoshop?;;
a friend of mine needs some troubleshooting tips.;;
please feel free to DM me if you or someone you know can help out. ;;
appreciate it! you guys are awesome! ;;
‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§;;
<@516763409417764865> your dongle is your what counts the most in life. Grow it take care of it, pat it ,measure it, cherish it, water it, play with it, caress it, be tender to it and try to have the biggest dongle of all dongles.;;
<@348165887347523594> do you play apex on ps4?;;
Origin;;
aaah;;
yeah im stupid;;
i think <@416803598173995018> plays on ps4;;
I should download it on ps4, but I don't want to go over my data plan since I still plan on downloading anthem's full game once it's out;;
<@348165887347523594> ok I'm gonna go pat my dongle if that's ok;;
Yeah <@516763409417764865> , take good care of your dongle.;;
With good care, it will grow fast and healthy;;
I figured you're not interested in Apex <@207416847019016202> right?;;
Yeah I‚Äôm on ps4;;
I may try to downloading it between tonight  and tomorrow and then tomorrow night and friday on my regular adsl 5mb/s line.  It's not like anthem is coming out this week and lots of people have it on ps4.;;
It just takes a long time at that rate. But so far I have never downloaded anything on my new internet setup and I shouldn't anyway;;
no im not interested, i asked because <@516763409417764865> asked if anyone ants to play it on ps4 or xbox;;
Good job <@!207416847019016202>, your dongle just grew to 26!;;
He asked, ho snapped, I didn't notice that;;
im sure you were too busy with your dongle <@348165887347523594>;;
I will definitely download it lol...Yeah, my dongle takes lots of my time and attention;;
well <@416803598173995018> just know that <@516763409417764865> has it on ps4 and is looking for players;;

Great stream <@488734758847905803>!!!!!;;

üò¶;;

how are you?;;
thanks <@!498246547838992414> !!;;
I'm gonna be streaming Kingdom Hearts 1 in a few minutes;;
actually when i was in hostel in st petersburg, right before sleep i lurked at <@488734758847905803> 's stream;;
he talked in a girls voice there;;
so i thought that im already dreaming;;
üòÖ;;
@everyone - I am live with Kingdom Hearts!;;
I talked like Mickey Mouse <@207416847019016202>  haha;;
yeah i know that you thought so;;
<@207416847019016202> vote! The Forest with friends OR Sims 4: The Pimp Adventures (part 2 of the 100 baby challenge);;
lets go make babies <@314733038854602752>;;
i meant sims;;
XD;;
post your link when youll go live please;;
Okay;;
if i will not sleep ill lurk;;
making babies is better than listen to <@488734758847905803> making weird voices;;
that's a lie and we both know  it <@!498246547838992414>;;
<@207416847019016202> *;;
haha you missed;;
team orange is huge as you see;;
hhaah;;
I am used to typing orange after the @;;
but now Crims comes up first;;
embrace it dude, rename yourself to OrangeMango <@488734758847905803>;;
Orangemango!;;
im pretty sure that origin games have english sound;;
i hope at least <@348165887347523594>;;
i will check it now;;
because i will not play on russian;;
but russian text is 100% unchangable;;
okay, no problem, dead space 1 have english option;;
Good, cause I never had games forcing me to install on one language;;
im sure you dont have very low regional price either;;
My prices are probably the highest in the entire world;;
origin games, same as the steam, mainly costs 30 bucks full price here;;
thats what i mean by regional prices;;
But I'm premier prices...and I never bought any games from origin though;;
they make locked to russian so nobody from martinique would not try buy it as a russian;;
lol maybe;;
not maybe, for sure;;
still, i bet access is cheaper here too;;
I'm sure;;
I get the highest prices for everything here;;
yeah, and here the cheapest;;
but i hate an idea of any russian language in games;;
so that one more point for steam;;
steam doesnt do it generally;;
ubisoft did it couple of times;;
I had this issue on xbox for some games but it rarely hapens now;;
hows it going everyone!;;
hey <@312379820933906442>;;

Nahh, it's waterproof;;
Well that‚Äôs great!;;
Yeah, I used to look at instagram in the shower, then I stopped because I was getting obsessed;;
Lol what phone do you have?;;
Now I barely open my insta;;
I don‚Äôt really get on Instagram a whole lot anymore;;
Yeah, I prefer to waste my life on reddit;;
I watch Instagram photos a little(you know, girls), but I'm trying to be subscribed to not a lot of them, so I could watch all photos in several minutes;;
Yo <@207416847019016202> or <@488734758847905803> Can one of you handsome devils make my name purple again?;;
Haha how did it happened;;
Lol <@!498246547838992414> and <@207416847019016202> that‚Äôs understandable;;
I assume you didn't unfollowed mango on twitch, so ok;;
<@207416847019016202> I wasn't subbed anymore;;
You still follow yes?;;

Good;;
Enjoy your color;;
I am a proud mango seed;;
I love watching purplemangos streams. I try to catch as many as I can;;

That‚Äôs awesome! Is he gonna share with you?;;
haha thats the whole point in ordering pizza in office for your birthday - to share;;
even with me;;
Oh haha I miss read it my bad;;
"your spelling of ""misread"" reminded me some story";;
couple of my friends (boy and girl), once went to Thailand, and they kinda crazy about spending their time in bath together, so it was important for them to have hotel room with bath;;
and they found it themselves, and when they went there, there was no bath;;
and they called me to clarify;;
they dont know english by the way;;
"long story short, they took ""hotel room with one bedroom"", thinking that bedroom is bathroom";;
thinking that bed is bath basically;;
Lol I didn‚Äôt realize it autocorrected lol I type to fast and it didn‚Äôt catch up. And It happens sometimes;;
i hate autocorrection;;
when i type in russian, autocorrect just suggest to me;;
but in english it corrects automatically;;
I‚Äôm not a big fan of autocorrect either cause when you type it one way it wants to change it to something else;;
yeah, and its okay if it only suggests;;
but it really corrects;;
Yeah I know lol;;
yeah hate autocorrect;;
also hi <:jamminjonny:536237981325852672>;;

Hahaha I'm jk <@207416847019016202>;;
Lmao! <@488734758847905803>;;
Glad you like OrMange <@207416847019016202> ;;
It's like brangelina;;
i dont know what brangelina is;;
Did you manage to sleep at all <@524820041976250368> or have you already woken up;;
i changed crim from white to purple;;
im sure <@524820041976250368> didnt sleep;;
Brangelina is what people called Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie when they were together;;
I‚Äôm still awake and going strong! Lmao I‚Äôm so tired tho <@488734758847905803>;;
Ah, thanks <@207416847019016202> ;;
Good mos;;
Mod*;;
oh yeah i got it <@488734758847905803>;;
<@524820041976250368> go to sleep! üòÉ;;
never played ANY res evil <@488734758847905803>;;
gonna be a trip;;
doing a laundry machine with all my brown clothing;;
have it laid out for the RE2 week;;
But I don‚Äôt wanna miss anyone‚Äôs streams! <@278571432588345345>;;

Haha I haven‚Äôt slept since 7am yesterday;;
holy shit <@524820041976250368> , please don't die;;
üòÆ <@278571432588345345> never played a resi;;
*gasp*;;
Whoa <@524820041976250368>;;
Hahah;;
Dude. Re2 remake isn't as scary to me as the original was to 12-year-old mango;;
only scary thing about that was the camera man;;
Yeah exactly;;
But that was scary enough;;
shit myself to think of playing a game with fixed camera;;
Lmfao;;
fuck fixed cameras;;
Yeah man;;
Silent Hill does that in a way too;;
In some moments I mean;;
Lmao I‚Äôm alright! <@278571432588345345> <@488734758847905803> and i agree re2 is not as scary as I thought it was gonna be;;
"You walk into a room and hear ""uuuuhhhh""";;
And can't see the fuckers;;
I mean, don't get me wrong <@524820041976250368> , it made me nervous af;;
But I'm not a very brave man when it comes to horror games / movies;;
There was a time in my life where I was tbh;;
Like between ages 17-22;;
Silent hill 2 was awesome, your reactions made it so much better! Haha <@488734758847905803>;;
Hahhahaha;;
Scaring my wife and stuff was awesome;;
But that game is great because the story is great;;
If it were just horror for the sake of horror, I wouldn't play it I think;;
That's why I prob won't play an Outlast game again;;
That game is fucking terrifyingly;;
Terrifying*;;
Yes it was, she doesn‚Äôt seem to get scared as much as you, but when you got scared she jumped üòÇ it was awesome!;;
What‚Äôs outlast? <@488734758847905803>;;
I haven‚Äôt watched that one;;
Hahaha yeah I think it's hilarious too;;
Omg Outlast is the scariest horror game ever;;
I literally shook with adrenaline when I played it;;
Have you streamed it? Or just played it?;;
"Ever see a game where 3 friends just keep saying ""it's your turn, I can't play it anymore""?";;
I streamed Outlast 2 in October;;
But it wasn't as scary as outlast 1;;
Haha no! But that would be epic! Imma have to find someone that‚Äôs streaming it üòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
Dude it's great for real;;
Horror is my lifeüíúüòÇ;;
I found most who streamed it either milked the jump scared too much, or tried to show that they weren't scared;;
But that's just me;;
Hahaha;;
I‚Äôm not gonna bring my dark side out too much. But there was this movie on Netflix I was watching with family and you get to choose options on how it turns out and let‚Äôs just say I became the psycho lmao so my family says üòÇ;;
Hahahaah;;
Is it that Black mirror movir?;;
Bander whatever?;;
Yes!;;

I totally get what you were saying about how people milk the jump scare too much or tried to show that they weren‚Äôt scared. I just watched a lil bit of outlast. <@488734758847905803>;;
Did you watch someone streaming it? <@524820041976250368>;;

I'm hungry af;;
I want borsht;;

it;;
borsch;;
there ya go;;
Hey <@207416847019016202> what's up bro?;;
im good, working;;
speaking about podcasts... anyone know why last inernational podcast is not on youtube?;;
I'm not sure why. But youtube has not been a good place lately . Karak will probably take care of it as soon as possible.;;
yeah monetization issues perhaps;;
usually its a day-two;;
not 6;;
yep...the more I get to talk to youtubers or streamers, the less I like youtube <@488734758847905803>;;
Well I can't just say youtube is the sole responsible I take that back. But the entire system seem to make it very hard to navigate through it;;
well i love using youtube , but i cant imagine being youtube blogger, cause of all this problems that they have;;
Exactly. It demands dedication, like full time dedication apparently, and promises nothing in return.;;
I love using youtube too, as it is the place where you can find everything.;;
yeah;;
but when i hear about all that demonetization and crazy copyright issues... fuck...;;
Agreed;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 20!;;
Damn power outage. And my generator is near empty. I can't even open my freaking gate I don't have the key to disengage the arms on it. Wow Kelly.  Great job locking me in.;;
damn;;
Oof;;
the universe is telling you to stay the fuck inside;;
haha yeah;;

Haha  <@488734758847905803>;;
Definitely;;

What games ? No power;;
This and a roblox card for my daughter birthday today;;
Lmao  <@111826600395378688>;;
Ho I thought you were telling me to get one  <@111826600395378688>;;
You totally should I'm sure you would love an LOL doll;;
Right now I sure would üòÇ;;
The s*** that they come out for kids literally gambling;;
LOL dolls are literally loot boxes for kids what the f***;;
Morning everyone;;
Morning;;
I had no idea tamagotchis still existed. Nice;;
Morning  <@456226577798135808>;;
They re release them recently;;
I don‚Äôt even know what that is;;
Tamagotchis were a mega hit  <@456226577798135808>;;
Remember I do live in a cave;;
üòÅ;;
Basically a digital pet that will die if you neglect it so real life;;
Ok. They had something like that here. I think it was called something else;;
hey <@456226577798135808>;;
how are ya?;;
Hey Purple.;;
what games? at least playing with dongle <@348165887347523594>;;
Tamagotchis were the first digital pet back in like the 90s I remember having one when I was 10;;
I‚Äôm good. How are u;;
good as well;;
excited to dive back into kingdom hearts later;;
I would have been excited if they released it for PC feelsbadman;;
Cool. I‚Äôm excited to jump into Division 2 Beta later;;
Ho yeah  <@207416847019016202> I still have my dongle right right.;;
Oh is that today?;;
Yeppers;;
Downloaded the 45gb last night.;;
Damn demo is huge;;
I haven't pre-ordered so I'm probably not going to play it probably going to dive back in Apex Legends holy crap that game is amazing;;
Beta or whatever they want to call it;;
It's just a demo guys;;
Apex is legit. They did good with that one;;
I love how anthems like this isn't a beta this is a demo LOL;;
Yea. They refer to it as the Beta. We get a few missions;;
I really wanted to be excited for Anthem but I just can't;;
Anthem was def a beta. Who are they kidding. Lol;;
Really? I enjoyed my time with it;;
That spider boss was fun to take down;;
Maybe because I'm just a Negative Nancy 80% of my time;;
Well I am pretty critical of games myself but I did enjoy it.;;
Sure there are some things they need to improve but I thought it was pretty solid;;
I didn't get to play that much I took a week off about the time it came out it was a a week I needed to myself mentally;;
They flying was a bit awkward;;
I'm just worried that there's not enough content someone like me is going to go through it in like a day or two and there's no PVP so those are my worries;;
Gotcha;;
Yeah the flying with a little awkward but I got used to it pretty fast keyboard and mouse you know I don't know how controller felt;;
Well I hope that content won‚Äôt be an issue.;;
Controller was weird.;;
The thing that they're trying to do is offer us a live service which that company is focus on so we're going to have to spend more and more money that's what they want;;
Good job <@!111826600395378688>, your dongle just grew to 5!;;
I kept slamming into shit;;
I don‚Äôt mind spending money if the content is worth the price.;;
Like I felt I wasted money on the AC Odyssey DLC;;
Just like Destiny 2 extra content couple missions may be arrayed? 30 bucks?;;
It so far hasn‚Äôt been enough content for the price IMO;;
I didn‚Äôt even glance at D2s content;;
I played the first two expansions for D2 and oh my God I beat in less than an hour it felt like;;
Oh for fucks sake that‚Äôs horrible.;;
A lot of my friends are like you should get back in the D2 it's great fantastic and I'm like I have to buy a $30 expansion now I'm good;;
The new expansion;;
I mean the DLC in Odyssey is 4-5 hours for each one so far but at the same time, I can spend 4-5 hours Fucking off in the game world.;;
Yea. That just too much IMO;;
Couch;;
Ouch I meant to say;;
Currently using Google speech-to-text at the moment;;
I‚Äôm currently using my fat thumbs on a phone lol;;
<@111826600395378688> , did you prefer Anthem or Apex so far?;;
Transporting some Contraband to my daughter's school Donuts for her birthday;;
Nice;;
Donut day;;
Oh my God Apex is amazing the Gunplay is perfect the sliding is perfect moment momentum is perfect;;
love me s ome donuts;;
Apex just needs jet packs. JK;;
And it's free dude I will download it to even just to give it a try;;
For a FTP, it‚Äôs fun;;
Good job <@456226577798135808>, your dongle just grew to 5!;;
Sort of how I felt about fortnite when it first came out for PVP let's just hope the community doesn't kill it for me;;
And they say bigger is better pffft;;
TRUE;;
i'll download it on my xbox later and give it a shot;;
Haha;;
but I generally dont like shooters without stories;;
actually, lemme rephrase;;
any game without a story;;
Morning mango's;;

Fuck no!!! I got a house for you in Martinique by the beach. Don't make me mad now  <@488734758847905803>;;
üòÖ;;
I want a house on the beach;;
<@488734758847905803> no for real, like if you guys need to crash for a bit our house is always open to you;;
that house is for me <@348165887347523594>;;
haha There's plenty of mango to go around <@348165887347523594> and <@416803598173995018>;;
I would also settle for a house on a lake in the mountains too;;
<@456226577798135808> I thought you were more of a swamp guy;;
lmao I'd take Kellys offer personally;;
Haha;;

I dont live by the beach;;
we don't want to live close to the beach;;
I‚Äôll take a cardboard box on the beach;;

<@488734758847905803>still my plan üòÖ;;
Needs electric and tv though;;
Lol;;

<@456226577798135808>got all that.;;
On a serious note, I really want to travel more.;;
I will give you guys tips to travel in south america;;
So much to see and experience out there;;
where dollars and euros rates are through the roof;;
dollar and euro*;;
<@488734758847905803> Cali seems to be the place for artitists;;
Chile - Santiago, one of the coolest places i've ever been;;
yeah that's what we're hoping for haha;;
I'm screwed either way personally;;
Who cares if i speak portuguese in the US?;;
Cali has a huge art scene. I have several close friends that are very involved and known in it here. Maybe they could help too?;;
I think my dongle straightened and hardened <@416803598173995018>;;
<:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840>;;
üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;

Yeah  <@416803598173995018> tends to provoque those reactions;;
lol <@488734758847905803> my best friend for over 20 years is a really well known sculptor out here. Dude just made his first million last year;;
<@348165887347523594> and he cant even hear my voice!;;
damn;;
Imagine if he could  <@416803598173995018> üòÇ;;
then my dongle would leak;;
lmao his dongle would explode. Yeah mango, hes crazy talented;;
but that's awesome <@416803598173995018> ;;
the closest to art that I get to now is my writing and streaming haha;;
I quit playing the bass a couple years ago;;
I can play guitar, drums and some piano. Thats all the art I can do lol. My Stick figures even suck;;
not for long, not for long <@488734758847905803>;;
I dunno <@207416847019016202>;;
<@488734758847905803> my buddy I was just talking about plays drums so if you play bass, then we have almost a full band;;
seems like I'm on the throne to stay;;
We need a name;;
hahaha;;
The 21 Changing Mangos;;
is throne dongle stuck or something? <@488734758847905803>;;
Him and I were actually in a band for years lol;;
stuck in you i meant;;
hahaha;;
lmao thats a good name;;
did you see the video I posted of my old band <@416803598173995018> ?;;
The drummer and vocalist weren't very good;;
He sits on his Mango throne, made of all the skins from the other fruits he has conquered;;
but the two guitarrists were awesome;;
lmao <@416803598173995018> hahaha;;
I did not, where is it?;;
i'll psot it again;;
ok cool;;
do you watch game of thrones? lol;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF_95ACSROk;;
I do;;
Thats where I was going with that;;
but i prefer the books;;
yeah i thought so;;
Ill watch in a bit. I have to read the books, I am more of a movie/tv show person though. My a.d.d. kicks in hard with books lol;;
Also why I didnt do great in school;;
true that;;
I have a studio version of that song with an actual professional vocalist if anyone is interestesd;;
but then I need to send it via wetransfer or something;;
That's awesome man, we never recorded. Just played a lot of shows;;
Our singer sucked but he was a great like band manager lo. Booked tons of gigs etc;;
nice;;
that vocalist was shit and didn't do shit;;
Shiiiieeeeetedidit  <@488734758847905803> rocks;;
A leaky dongle is not a good dongle.;;
Need to get that shit checked;;
yeah, i can't control it;;
Ha;;
Omg lol;;
"i've heard the word ""premature"" a lot <@456226577798135808>";;
thanks <@348165887347523594> haha;;
I wrote the song and lyrics;;
Lmao;;
just didn't compose the guitar solo;;
lol I miss playing music man. My buddy and I were gonna rent some jam spaces like once a month and just jam and hang out. Havent played really since college;;
True.;;
I dont miss the grind of trying to have a band though;;
that's for sure;;
grind - you mean making people hanging out with mango?;;

"it's a trick I call ""Asking Carina""";;
ahhh hahaha;;
Damn, I gotta get her to make mine then lol;;
<@!498246547838992414> , it's because of Twitch's background policy;;
It was also her idea;;
If it's like a word or something;;
or a phrase;;
she can def do it;;
<@207416847019016202> you streaming today? I need more accent lessons;;
But for Discord I mean;;
That's awesome mango, I will definitely be in touch when I am able to do that stuff. After June, I will have a whole new setup and be getting all the animations etc;;
nice!;;
can't wait;;
Do you think it'll still be visible <@!498246547838992414> ?;;
without the white background?;;
I don't know, but I could try to make the original without the background, and also another with a lighter shade of purple;;
lol me too. I have all my stuff I wanna buy ready to go on amazon. Got my separate account that I‚Äôm putting savings into. Ready to go! Just gotta wait and save lol. Waiting is killing me lol;;

Cause I love team Orange and  <@416803598173995018>. Don't know who are you  <@488734758847905803>;;
<@207416847019016202> ‚ù§;;
They don‚Äôt have an orange heart, sorry. There is a purple one though;;
Eat it  <@416803598173995018>;;
And you will be free from him;;
Eat his heart? But dramatic, no?;;
Drastic I meant;;
That's the only way to become true Orange  <@416803598173995018>;;
üò¶;;
Lmao I‚Äôm not as hardcore as you are then orange;;
üíî;;
No love here at all lol;;
You weak American  <@416803598173995018>;;
<@488734758847905803> Yeah, it definitely does lmao;;
Who's heart needs eating?;;
It's purple heart. Do detective work from there;;
Mango apparently. You need to eat his heart in order to be come true Russian orange;;
<@488734758847905803> C'mere I need to show you something;;
Lol  <@498246547838992414>;;
Go team orange;;
#teamorangeisbetterthanmango;;
üçäüçäüçä;;
I hate oranges though. I've never eaten a mango before but I like mango flavored stuff;;
Good job <@!416803598173995018>, your dongle just grew to 16!;;
Yeah 16! <@!498246547838992414> youll never catch me!!!;;
Damn, Im still so far away from <@348165887347523594> lol. I need 600 more messages to catch up to him.  Dont think I ever will;;
I tasted mango at least;;
grrrrrr;;
My gf loves fruits;;
Especially mangos;;
*mango juice*;;
üòà <@207416847019016202> , didnt want to tell you that was happening;;
Mango's real name is: Purp L. Mangoson;;
You don't  want to know how many mangos were killed with a knife in my kitchen;;
<@488734758847905803>;;
lmao;;
were any of them purple <@207416847019016202> ?;;
Lol;;
didn't think so;;
You don't want to know  <@488734758847905803>;;
lmao;;
I didnt even know purple mangos were a thing lol;;
I just thought there was only one kind of mango;;
Oh there are many;;
Sadly I know it;;
Only one orange though;;
It's hard to find good mango in moscow;;
I grew up somewhat poor so I didnt try alot of different foods until I was older. I didnt even know what an avocado was until I moved to California lol;;
No wonder  <@207416847019016202>;;
Nothing can possibly grow in that fucking cold;;
Except vodka;;
Vodka trees;;
Also NO good avocados in moscow  <@416803598173995018>;;
I can't understand if  <@278571432588345345> joking or not, but of course mangos don't grow in Russia;;
Vodka trees is good though;;
lmao <@278571432588345345>;;
lol isnt vodka made from potatoes though?;;
Come to California, lots of good avocados here;;
No idea;;
Just googled, vodka is made from potatoes lol. I wonder why the Irish dont drink more vodka then;;
Hope you all are having a wonderful day!;;
You too <@524820041976250368> ! Work is slow, I just want to go home and play games lol;;

ooops, you thought i mean your wife...;;
i think your joke failed cause i didnt understand;;
hahaha;;
haha;;
like, she isnt my wife, but someone else's?;;
ok, thanks to your wife;;
hahaha;;
no, joke was that i called you mrs mango;;
ahhh ok;;
not your best work;;
but good stuff;;
lol I chuckled;;
it would be #1 amongst your jokes <@488734758847905803>;;
If he is a Mrs. He cant have a dongle;;
thats the point. he doesnt <@416803598173995018>;;
Oh ok so you're number 1 then;;
My dongle makes other dongles look huge;;
it's just a lump;;
lmao I dont kno why but I pictured that and now I feel sick;;
hahahaah;;
did you watch happy on netflix?;;
that'll clear that sickness right up;;
great show;;
lol no, havent heard of it. Whats it about?;;
I dont even want to say so as not to spoil it;;
+100 karma to <@488734758847905803>;;
"i consider ""what is about"" a huuuge spoiler";;
-0 to <@416803598173995018>;;
you had immunity this time;;
hahaha;;
yeah, that's why i never watch trailers;;
the most i'll say about a show is like;;
It's fantasy;;
It's medieval;;
yeah i never watch them too;;
Just googled it lol. Good cast, I will check it out;;
yeah dude;;
i binged that shit;;
"sometime ""its fantasy"" is a huge spoiler, because you know, for example, movie starts, and first 10-15 minutes its not clear if there will be any magic and such <@488734758847905803>";;
or it will be usual movie;;
ah no of course;;
Im rewatching game of thrones now. I cant wait for the new season;;
then I wouldnt say anything <@207416847019016202>;;
I mean like a movie like Lord of the Rings;;
yeah i got you, agree <@488734758847905803>;;
"I'd say ""It's a type of medieval fantasy""";;
yeah, but they changed so much <@416803598173995018> , you know right?;;
like, at this point it's all fan fiction basically;;
From the books you mean?;;
GRRM isn't participating much in the writing;;
yeah;;
he's said that it is very far from what he envisioned;;
ahh ok, I figured but I havent read any of them so I wasnt sure\;;
thats usually what happens when books get turned into movies, tv shows, games etc though;;
yeah;;
but the first few seasons of GoT were pretty good with that;;
Yeah unfortunately thats what happens. I just dont want Bronn to die, hes my favorite;;
yeah I like him too;;
I like to think that's how I would be if I lived in that world lol;;
orange would be the hound or the mountain I think;;
I've never watched a single GoT episode;;
go ahead, smite me;;
No judgements, I know several people who have never seen it;;
several people and one orange;;
so crim is under protection;;
no smiting;;
hahaha;;
you're the ones who are missing out is all;;
I would probably be like tyrion;;
except without money;;
Team orange UNITE!!!;;
lmao except without money;;
am I under protection? <@207416847019016202>;;
I guess not <@416803598173995018>;;
He doesn't need protection;;
He's master chief;;
you are team purple <@416803598173995018>;;
go ask your superior for protection;;
I am master chief, so I am my own superior!;;
So I will ask myself;;
<@416803598173995018> do you need protection?;;
do voices! do voices!;;
no <@416803598173995018> I dont because I am the master chief;;
XD;;
If I did voices, you couldnt hear them though lol;;
I forgot how life worked for a second there;;
Finally got fuel for my generator. My work meeting was postpone and I can't think of anything else but play some more Wolfenstein;;
*play fortnite*;;
Good job <@!498246547838992414>, your dongle just grew to 14!;;

Only when a friend asks me;;
Damn <@416803598173995018> and <@!498246547838992414> your dongles are in a tight race;;

<@!498246547838992414> eh I will have free time during the week so I will keep up with discord. Cant let you get ahead;;
dongle crew is already a thing;;
"ho ho ho shieeetedidididit!!! I""ve been invited to the Division 2 private beta...my dongle is getting bigger by the second";;
Lol my bad, it‚Äôs a habit. <@207416847019016202> and hey! <@!498246547838992414> I‚Äôm alright didn‚Äôt get much sleep. So I‚Äôm still tired. How‚Äôre you?;;
Nice! <@348165887347523594>;;
I have not played the first one;;
I'm doing better than when we last spoke <@524820041976250368> I'm dry now;;
I really like the first one. This one should be good. I wasn't expecting the invite. Someone from another discord noticed I said I was interested and sent me an invite;;
That's awesome! Very nice of them;;
True...now I have to download the damn thing lol;;
Lol but you have better internet now so  shouldn‚Äôt be too bad, right?;;
<@488734758847905803> does your wife do overlays for twitch also? Like for stream elements specifically;;
Yeah, it should be alright.;;
<@348165887347523594> yesterday had no troubles watching me in 1080p;;
thats awesome;;
no need for affiliate haha!;;
She doesnt yet <@416803598173995018>;;
she does masks for the webcam and stuff;;
like Jonny's squares around the camera;;
but nothing too crazy haha;;
I think she could do overlays if she had to, but she doesn't know what file;;
what code;;
because they usually follow a number;;
like, a sub overlay;;
or something;;
if it's static art, like a fixed image;;
i can't see why not if it's not too crazy;;
Ahh ok. I was trying to make my own earlier and failed so miserably lol;;
I‚Äôm just gonna use their stock ones for now. Found some cool themes;;
yeah the stock ones are cool;;
I use a stock one myslef;;
or used to tb;;
I found like an 80‚Äôs outrun style one. Looked nice;;
tbh*;;
If you like muse, it reminds me of their new album art;;
I am not a fan;;
i only heard a song or two though to be fair;;
Oh man, you should listen to more. I love muse. Though it is definitely not for everyone;;
Matt is an amazing guitarist and vocalist;;
I will check them out then;;
did you check out any of the daily artistic recommendations?;;
in <#540870190846574602> ?;;
CAUSE I WON'T FORGIVE YOU IF YOU HAVEN'T;;
nah jk of course;;
I haven‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt care if you wouldnt! Lol I‚Äôll check it out though;;
<@488734758847905803> Stockholm syndrome is my favorite muse song. Good song to start with too;;
lmao;;
that's actually the name of one of my favorite greydon square songs;;
Lol that‚Äôs funny. Not familiar with them, will check them out. Any song recommendations?;;
greydon square is a former group home child (orphaned);;
he was in the military then became an atheist and got his degree in quantum physics;;
dude's a genius;;
he's a rapper;;
all my alerts are songs of his;;
"good song of his also would be ""starbreaker""";;
I am going to name my stream title after you today <@207416847019016202>;;
Ahh ok, that music is good!;;

Damn some days are just weird. The power outage seem to have affected my mobile provider as well. I can't even make a phone call. The 4g boxes get 2 bars, but it's not great. Not going to download the game on that and I can barely watch twitch streams. üò¶ It's a Wolfenstein 2 call..it won't let me do anything else today;;
OtMange hearts gets my vote;;

Now you are <@207416847019016202>;;
I'm sorry <@207416847019016202> I meant the logo I made;;
What orange thing? <@!498246547838992414>;;
We have sexualized you and you're nothing more than an object of desire <@207416847019016202> ...you got what you asked for;;
Lmao;;
That logo I made for team orange, what did you think?;;
<@524820041976250368>;;
to sexualize me <@!498246547838992414> need to add some panties on logo;;
On it cap'n;;
jk;;
Not doing THAT;;
Only if you want me to OwO;;
üòÇ üòÇ;;
Frick;;
I need to get up to grab a book;;
Orange colored panties;;
But I'm sitting really comfortably;;
Halp;;
lol, I know the feeling;;
Ugh that‚Äôs the worst. No, the worst is when you sit down and get comfy and then realize you have to pee;;
lmao so true;;
the worst is when you standing;;
sitting is good;;
I'm sitting comfortably in my bed working on a project on my laptop, and the book I need is across my room;;
ü§î;;
Thinking about <@207416847019016202> last comment here;;
Should I ask my mom to get it for me?;;
I would <@!498246547838992414> , and I would text her;;
I yelled down at her;;
"She said ""fuck up, you lazy ballocks""";;
Yelling is already too much energy consuming;;
lol;;
Not kidding;;
Irish parents are gr8;;
<@207416847019016202> standing is the worst. 2 jobs ago, most of my job standing alot;;
dont think too much man, make love <@348165887347523594>;;
<@!498246547838992414> you're Irish?;;
Half <@416803598173995018>;;
My mom is Irish;;
now you can watch my streams at work, so i guess its better <@416803598173995018>;;
Well, now I like you even more! I'm almost half Irish;;
That's why my English doesn't suck completely;;
I should <@207416847019016202>;;

Well then, we're officially best mates <@416803598173995018>;;

everything you will say can be used against you;;
Sounds good to me! <@!498246547838992414> lol I still haven't made it to Ireland, want to go so badly. I am a mutt though, have all sorts of different ethnicities in my blood lol;;
<@207416847019016202> lol yes we have to read people their miranda rights here when you arrest someone;;
I've been there a lot, and I too have lots of different ethnicities in my blood;;
haha cool, we dont have that in russia;;
i think we dont;;
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in court. You have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions. You have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish. If you decide to answer questions now without a lawyer present, you have the right to stop answering at any time.;;
No I dont think you do that in Russia lol. Its a little different there;;
you should record it and use on your streams as follow sound <@416803598173995018>;;
English, Irish, Belgian, Itallian, German and probably some others, I don't know half my family;;
I think it's high time for me to get that book;;
<@!498246547838992414> very cool! Im Irish, German, French, Welsh, Scottish, Portuguese, Senegalese and English;;
lol that's a good idea <@207416847019016202>;;
haha, and i am Russian, and... and thats all bitches;;
Pure blooded!;;

Good job!;;

I googled Russian Orange and this came up;;
lmao;;
lol;;
haha;;
one tip for you, this kinda hat is 100% way to recoznise tourist;;
lol I wouldnt ever wear that hat. I dont look good in most hats;;
My accent is all over the place when I speak English, It's like an irish accent mixed with american;;
lol that's pretty funny <@!498246547838992414> I just have a Boston accent, not too bad though;;
and all the accents I can do too lol;;
Still working on Russian accent;;
i dont look good in anything, but you know, voice is what matter <@416803598173995018>;;
My hair are too damn long to even consider wearing a hat;;
I can't do accents, but on good days I can morph my voice into sounding non-human;;
my hair is history;;
I like your beanie and game over shirt <@207416847019016202>;;
i started balding at 20 i think, and now its only on the sides;;
damn...I starting growing at about that age;;
I have a luscious full head of hair;;
shirt is cool, i bought it for streams to be honest <@416803598173995018>;;
I cant grow a beard though;;
too patchy;;
I have a receiding hairline, and I'm younger;;
I have little facial hair...just on my chin and my mustache;;
that's why I have a bit longer hair;;
I don't even have hair on my arms...Hairless boy right there;;
I have a lil hair on my face, much more than anybody else in my class lmao, and I have hair literally everywhere, arms, legs, chest etc;;
you would not make it in cold Russia then <@348165887347523594> lol;;
It's good if you live in a cold environment <@!498246547838992414>;;
I know <@416803598173995018> üòÖ;;
If it's winter here then yes;;
we must visit orange in the summer;;
yeah;;
Does summer even exist in Russia?;;
may - september;;
If it's summer, here it can get up to 36 degrees;;
I am also not hairy and have very little fat on me lol;;
You won't make it there either than;;
lol;;
i suggest may-september guys. its not cold;;
wow thats hot <@!498246547838992414>;;
we have up to 30 here in summer;;
<@416803598173995018> consider that we speak celcius;;
Nope I wouldnt make it in the winters lol. I was ok in Boston during the winters, it gets very cold there but not like Russia;;
<@!498246547838992414> That's even hotter than Martinique in summer;;
Yeah, last summer was hell;;
<@207416847019016202> Damn, I thought is was always cold in Russia;;
lol yes I know celcius <@207416847019016202>;;
seriously? <@348165887347523594>;;
America needs to switch to metric;;
And Belgium isn't even known for it's warmth;;
summers is warnm and hot even in really cold cities;;
I swear I thought it was always cold in Russia bro;;
and moscow is warm;;
now its -3. for winter its nothing;;
Thats not too bad;;
<@!498246547838992414> Belgium has a similar weather than France doesn't it?;;
i was born here;;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakutsk;;
is the second coldest city with more than 100,000 inhabitants in the world after Norilsk, although Yakutsk experiences colder temperatures in the winte;;
God, no <@348165887347523594> Belgium has worse weather normally;;
you can see temperatures table there;;
and still, its +25 +30 in summer there;;
<@!498246547838992414> I thought so, it's so close;;
<@207416847019016202> That is nice man....I should come and visit;;
Second coldest city, so there is a colder city and that means there is a stronger orange out there then;;
;;
A much stronger, with thicker skin <@416803598173995018>;;
check out these;;
they close schools at -50;;
<@348165887347523594> that means <@207416847019016202> has competition;;
i remember that, and it was okay, because cloth is warm;;
-50 damn, that's cold;;
that depends on humidity a lot. if humidity is low, -50 is not so bad;;
Yeah I guess so;;
I never seen it? I‚Äôm behind on chat lol <@!498246547838992414>;;
-50 would freeze me instantly;;
i lived in a sea city, and there -35 is worse than -50 in Yakutsk;;
No doubt;;
<@524820041976250368> we have been talking alot today lol;;

Lol true. You should be fine to change it. I forget when they are changing that;;
"Most my accounts are ""daya or misterdaya"" , I will soon try and have one name on all platform. Was thinking of ""oneeyedkellyd""...but...the dongle name seems tempting";;
One eyed Kelly is a pretty badass name though;;

Heyo everyone! üî•;;
Hey <@136319407491121152> !;;
How are ya buddy?;;
Hi  <@136319407491121152>;;
Hello;;
Hey all!;;
heeeey <@416803598173995018>;;
duude;;
Let's do a hello echo chamber;;
Helloooooo;;
Hello;;
How is everyone today? You get any sleep? <@87241615671832576>;;
Yeah I got around 4 hours in  :);;
Are you like <@207416847019016202> and don‚Äôt need a lot of sleep?;;
Good morning everyone I hope you all have a wonderful day!;;
Morning Cajun!;;
No I am the opposite. If I don't get a regular sleep I am dead for a couple of days. Which never is very harmonious with having kids XD;;
Morning <@287320205020102667>;;
<@87241615671832576> ahh that's rough, I need sleep too. Im usually just groggy and unpleasant to be around if I dont lol. I dont have kids though, I have periods of not sleeping great. I love sleep so much lol;;
I am always unpleasant to be around  <@416803598173995018>;;
Lol <@207416847019016202>. That okay, we still like you. I find it important to have that one grumpy Russian friend you always know will be around because he is the way he is ;);
Hey guys, who here has played anthem? What did you think?;;
I'm doing well <@416803598173995018> , hbu?;;
Hey <@287320205020102667> !;;
I did, and I loved it;;
Reposting this . He says everything this I think about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQi_rDz-aXo;;
I played for hours and had a pretty bland experience. Boss fights was okay, but the flying with mouse + keyboard was not fun. But with controllers it should be great. ;;
All the weapons was nearly impossible to differentiate. ;;
But it was beautiful;;
I see.;;
Yeah Kelly and I were saying how a flying game probably isn't good with a mouse and keyboard;;
Now, I am more of a story guy;;
<@87241615671832576> I agree that it's not a game meant to be played with keyboard and mouse.. Yeah <@488734758847905803>;;
If this game has a good story, then I'll be more interested indeed;;
The story in destiny2 was very weak imo;;
It's a simple story;;
My problem is I really can't do any precise shooting with a controller,  so they kind of miss me twice;;
I have high hope for the story.  That little side quest in the demo was pleasant <@488734758847905803> .;;
<@87241615671832576> I got you. But I don't think this game requires precise shooting .;;
duude <@348165887347523594>;;
<@207416847019016202> Yes brother;;
<@207416847019016202> I dont think you're unpleasant. <@488734758847905803> doing good! Its Friday so Im happy lol;;
tomorrow mornin ill try streaming with some chat bot. i have evening to work on some ideas for it;;
youre wrong lol <@416803598173995018>;;
<@348165887347523594> ! Whats up man?;;
With all of those weak spots needed to be kind of precise to hit those while avoiding damage;;
<@207416847019016202> when I come to Russia, I will find out;;
sup mangoes;;
Anthem looks good but its still EA so that worries me;;
ill be pleasant then, bit it will be cold russian lie <@416803598173995018>;;
Sup <@416803598173995018>  My internet is still shit today. It was alright last night...But this morning they announced that the antenna was damaged. So back to shit;;
<@416803598173995018> I know...but I cross my fingers;;
<@278571432588345345> Hello my man;;
Yeahh EA make alot of people nervous. I find it Interesting about the rumour that Respawn didn't want a huge PR thing Apex because of the EA association;;
<@207416847019016202> I'm looking forward to this that üòâ;;
<@207416847019016202> lol <@348165887347523594> that sucks man, sorry to hear that;;
I'll stay patient...At least they acknowledged there was a real issue.;;
<@87241615671832576> That is interesting. I dont think Respawn was doing well when EA bought them so maybe they had no choice. Either go under or be bought by EA;;
let me know if youll be watching tomorrow, ill switch to 720p <@348165887347523594>;;
Get that net back @<@348165887347523594> so we can be scrubs in another game another day;;
<@207416847019016202> What time?;;
Could be <@416803598173995018>;;
3 am your time <@348165887347523594>;;
<@87241615671832576> My adsl line is good enough for coop. Just not watching streams;;
I love Respawn though, they make great games. EA, not so much anymore lol;;
<@207416847019016202> I should be up. Pretty good time for me.;;
Hey <@278571432588345345> boi!;;

Cool;;
Both...this morning we did some gears of war though. When anthem comes out, I'll go balls deep though  <@416803598173995018>;;
Are we getting recked in Apex? ;);
Always good to go balls deep in a exosuit;;
I can't right now, but in about 2 hours I'm definitely down for some Apex <@87241615671832576>;;
<@87241615671832576> true true haha;;
I have the kids alone, so I am not sure if I can. My wife is out of town for 10 day, while she's directing a horror theater show.;;
Hoooo, she does...niiiooooooce!!;;

No problem, if we can play,  we'll do. If not, I'll play with my dongle, I haven't been present enough for my dongle lately. I'll take that time to show my dongle some love;;
but you dont have a console, right?;;
feelzbad;;
Yeahh I am thinking of actually stream every night. If I can find something to have fun with;;
oh nice;;
<@348165887347523594> <@488734758847905803> <@87241615671832576> I might be on later for some apex tonight.;;
nice!;;
what time?;;
I will be free tomorrow for a big chunk of the day;;
since my wife will be with some friends;;
It depends on a few things, should have a better feel for things in a few hours. Tomorrow might be tough for me, not sure yet lol. Lots up stuff up in the air this weekend so far;;
I see;;
<@416803598173995018> Ok, just let us know. I'm still downloading the game but it should be done in about 5 hours;;

Orange will fuck up mango for the throne;;
but why did i put my finger in the air?;;
Fuck UP;;
to check wind?;;
Lmao;;
oh i got it;;
What is everyone up to today/;;
?*;;
I am checking out singdeath's stream right now;;
and thinking of what to do with my day;;
Just followed him. I cant wait to be done with work. Waiting to hear back about that interview, might possibly have it today. If not, gotta go look at cars with my fiance. She needs one now that she got her job and isnt working at home anymore;;
true that;;
what car you looking at/;;
dude, got my fingers crossed for you;;
Something cheap lol. I found a few to go look at, hate buying cars and dealing with salesman lol. Thanks man, hope it works out this time. Just waiting to hear back from them;;
yeah car salesmen are the worst;;
Agreed, they try to trick you into buying shit that you don't need or want;;
Lol;;
Afternoon everyone;;
lol yeah but I know all their games. I dont fuck around buying cars, I am direct and have a price I want. If they dont meet it, I leave;;
hey <@508094590436507668> how are you?;;
hey <@508094590436507668> , how are ya?;;
"I usually have made my choice long before I deal with a salesman. I hate shopping what ever the thing  I'm going to shop for. Salesman approaches, and I'd  be like ""get the paperwork there is nothing to discuss""";;
"lol yeah Im kinda the same way Kelly. I start the convo out with "" I dont want to play games and I want no bullshit"" haha";;
Hell yeah üòÖ , so they know to keep it short haha;;
lol yeah;;
They are not here to make you save any kind of money anyway. The thing is overpriced from a start. Get the lower price (without jeopardizing his salary)with no compromising and I'm all good.  I will not take any of the candies/sweets on the desk.;;
same <@348165887347523594>;;
fuck those candies;;
I always think theyre dirty;;
or poisoned;;
that shit ain't free;;
Exactly <@488734758847905803>  lol;;
It ain't free for shit;;
I eat all of them, get the price I want and then take their job;;
That is another way to deal with it lol. Which isn't that bad either <@416803598173995018>;;
Its a power move;;
lol Im kidding I dont do that;;
loool;;
<:PM:539114910211112995> <:Emote_DONGLE_MASTER_112_00000:543050254157873173>;;
Hows your dongle today Kelly?;;
"hhmm, I can't really be extra positive about my dongle's state today. If I wasn't trying to keep positive I'd say that it hasn't been a good day so far. But , there is always a ""BUT"".  My dongle is healthy, it knows that tomorrow will be a wonderful day and that is what counts";;
How is yours <@416803598173995018> ? It's dangling?;;
lol internet issues getting your dongle down? Im good, its Friday so thats happy for me!;;

i plan on streaming a little bit of nba 2k19 maybe some apex legends because i havent played it yet! <@488734758847905803>;;
damn <@312379820933906442> ;;
i enjoyed it much more than destiny 2 personally;;
i think youre in for a good time;;
it looks sick;;
i never played destiny;;
lol;;
haha ah i see;;
Too much grinding in Destiny for me. I like it but god damn, its not worth all the work you have to put into it;;
feelzbad <@361554595354509312> , missed the end of your stream;;
yeah agreed <@416803598173995018>;;
getting those guns and shit sucks ballz;;
yep exactly, it just got frustrating and I thought MP sucked;;
I would guess Looter shooter might not be your thing?;;
lol no, not really;;
I can't really get into these games for a long time.e;;
üòÇ;;
haha;;
I like STORIES;;
gimme stories;;
I wanna know if Joel and Ellie are going to be ok;;
alright;;
time to do work;;
and stuff;;
Yeah Destinys story sucked lol;;
You have a favorite game Mango?;;
yeah i agree;;
favorite game?;;
hard to choose one;;
lol yeah it is;;
I have a handful of games that resonated strongly with me as a child/teenager;;
I'd say the one that resonated the most was Ocarina of Time;;
Which is why i tattooed the triforce on my hand;;
Then in my teen years I got very involved with Final Fantasy X;;
Then FF7;;
And Kingdom Hearts;;
I find it very hard to have a favorite game.;;
lol ok favorites games then;;
Every once a while there will be a game that blows my mind;;
I have the same. But Black and White had a very strong appeal to me;;
I have played hundreds, probably like you all so its tough to even remember them all;;
Same here <@416803598173995018>;;
I can't even remember them;;
Whaddup! <@348165887347523594>;;
Paper boy was one tough one though.;;
hey <@287320205020102667> !!;;
Hello <@287320205020102667>;;
Heeeeey <@287320205020102667> ....wazup ?;;
Yoooo! <@488734758847905803> you liked how we rolled in the other day and showed the mango some love;;
Working my life away and cold <@348165887347523594> lol;;
Hiya <@87241615671832576> how are ya;;
Damn, on the road right?;;
Hell yeah I did <@287320205020102667>;;
Doing well;;
Figured it was the least I can do to show some appreciation;;
<@488734758847905803>;;
Ranger X on Sega Genesis was one of my favorites growing up. Once I got N64, 007 and Ocarina of Time were definitely the ones I loved most. PS1 was FF7 for sure. Xbox was Halo for me, Xbox 360 was Modern Warfare, PS2 was GTA Vice City, PS3 was Call of Duty Black ops 1 and 2. PS4 is probably Witcher 3 or Titanfall 2;;
Yes sir <@348165887347523594> I‚Äôm picking up in Kentucky and heading to Tennessee;;
Vice city!! No one ever talks about vice city;;
But yeah theres tons I dont even remember playing lol. If I saw it or someone said it, Id be like oh yeah I remember that game!;;
Horizon zero Dawn was also amazing;;
Yes I love horizon zero dawn I;;
Resident evil 4 too;;
Metal gear solid 2;;
devil may cry;;
Shit theres so many games lol;;
Silent Hill 2;;
Amazing game;;
Amazing story;;
need for speed underground 2;;
Now you've lost me;;
yea silent hill 2 was cool;;
Don't like cars in general haha;;
oh man, that was the only one I liked lol;;
car games I mean;;
Ah I see;;
I love cars though lol;;
all the star wars games before EA bought it lol;;
I appreciate it a lot <@287320205020102667> !;;
Sorry my messages aren't going through, on my phone;;
wish I could look up and see all the games I have played over the years;;
Apex is done downloading on ps4 boys.;;
Nice!;;

No problem <@416803598173995018>;;

I'm listening to Belgian music, I've been missing out lmao;;
I love this shit;;
I‚Äôve never listened to Belgian music! <@!498246547838992414>;;
Well, It's mostly older stuff;;
It's good tbh;;
Imma listen in a bit;;
Okay, I recommend Raymond van het groenewoud, slongs dievanongs, wim soutaer, bart kaell, clouseau and la√Øs;;
Diablo Blvd is a Belgian metal band who is signed by Nuclear Blast, they're also really good;;
Okay thank you!;;
No problem!!;;
I‚Äôm still having some issues viewing streams. I just had my data reset when I added the new card the smorning but it‚Äôs still cutting in and out for some reason;;
I was having issues with twitch yesterday and today also;;
It was lagging and skipping a ton, especially on mobile;;
same;;
could be a platform issue;;
I heard twitch has had problems since they had the big update including the continues of sub streaks so it's effecting alot of people's streams;;
Good job <@!136319407491121152>, your dongle just grew to 1!;;
Yay lol;;
<:Emote_DONGLE_MASTER_112_00000:543050254157873173>;;

Gotta get that dongle bigger! Lol;;
lets hope it will not hurt my stream lol;;
Nothing can hurt your stream orange. It‚Äôs too strong;;
yeah its too hard;;
It's minor stuff from what I heard you should be fine üòÇ;;
yeah i hope <@136319407491121152>;;
if my stream will have lags, how else our guys will hear shit about themselves;;
Damn I‚Äôm almost at 1000 views on Twitch. That‚Äôs crazy!;;
cool;;
ill be there someday;;
I still have a long way to go lol. Would be cool to do this full time;;
yeah;;
i honestly shoud think about working from home;;
it would be hard because our company doesnt have such tradition;;
but maybe someday ill manage to do it;;
at least for now i can go home whenever i want;;
That‚Äôs very nice. Wish I could do that lol. I have interview with esports company hopefully today. That would be a nice job to get;;
I really want to stream full time or work for a video game company;;
Nice <@416803598173995018>;;

I just started talking <@207416847019016202> and she fell asleep from the boredom;;
NO OFFENSE at all, but it seems im only person in ther world on whose stream <@524820041976250368> didnt hang out üòÄ;;
apparently your voice is not very sexy <@409836692158021632>;;
<@488734758847905803> <@348165887347523594> I should be on apex around 1500-1530 PST today if you can;;
I am deciding if i should play kingdom hearts today again;;
or something else;;
almost tiem for the stream!;;
what are other options? <@488734758847905803>;;
my voice is the exact opposite of <@416803598173995018> ;;
dogs bark and yelp and my children run away everytime;;
aside from killing yourself of course;;
I wasn‚Äôt bored! And <@207416847019016202> I have made it to one stream! I‚Äôll definitely be there tonight! And <@409836692158021632> thanks üôÑ for turning tazz on me and making him make me go to sleep too. Lmao;;

RE2 perhaps;;
<@488734758847905803> after stream wanna try to get on apex if Kelly D is available?;;
<@416803598173995018> pls don't watch any of my streams;;
you're better off doing better things like going to the toilet or looking at <@488734758847905803> 's beard;;
my stream is where dreams die;;
okay then, lets go back to that suicide option <@488734758847905803>;;
I might <@416803598173995018> , but since my wife will be out of the house tomorrow and working on sunday, i might spend some time with her after my stream;;
do RE2 <@488734758847905803>;;

lmao *blushes*;;
wow so many people here, and im so shy;;
hey <@348165887347523594> I will be on at 1500 PST today;;
<@488734758847905803> there is no time to spend with the wife! you must stream for all of us and cancel all plans with the outside world like <@160543395037708288>;;
okay i believe you <@524820041976250368> !!! thank you so much;;

Don‚Äôt thank me! I enjoyed your stream! <@207416847019016202>;;
Ok no pro;;
which game that was <@524820041976250368> ?;;
<@409836692158021632> thats not true man, you have great content!;;
Maybe next week then <@488734758847905803> for apex? Tomorrow will be tough for me Sunday I am tied up all day;;
my daughter makes the great content;;
"I'm just there to press the ""broadcast now"" button";;
üòÇ;;
yeah, during Sundays <@416803598173995018> likes getting tied up;;
i just spent whole evening, tuning chat bot. tomorrow we will see if it will be any good;;
OR IF IT WILL BE FUCKING GREAT;;
lol <@409836692158021632> I usually use handcuffs <:Emote_DONGLE_MASTER_112_00000:543050254157873173>;;
üëÄ üöì;;
I'm looking forward to that <@207416847019016202>;;
lmao I mean I used to be a cop, so I have alot!;;
ok too personal now lol;;
I really hope my internet will be fixed...It's been almost 2 days;;
Hope so too <@348165887347523594> thats very frustrating;;
It is, all I can do is play games lol;;
Atom rpg <@207416847019016202>;;
cool <@524820041976250368>;;
<@348165887347523594> at least you can do that lol. Imagine if you couldnt even play games;;
I feel out of the loop;;
What's this apex game what everybody is talking about;;
I love watching apex! I wish I could play it!;;
Lemme go figure out what it is first;;
Then I'll judge;;
<@416803598173995018> I'd be abusing my dongle;;
with no internet? Just your imagination? Thats rough lol;;
I can imagine a bunch of things owo;;
Yep lol;;
Currently installing origin again for apex;;
Cool <@!498246547838992414> , do you have a ps4 ?;;
nice <@!498246547838992414> ;;
check it out and let us know what you think;;
it's currently my favorite game right now;;
<@524820041976250368> Why can't you play it?;;
Yeah, but I'd rather play on pc <@348165887347523594>;;
It's on all platforms <@524820041976250368>;;
I don‚Äôt have any consoles right now, and don‚Äôt currently have my laptop <@348165887347523594>;;
<@!498246547838992414> Yeah sure, I got it on both pc and ps4..so I get to play it with more people;;
Ho too bad <@524820041976250368> . So at least you can watch those great streams.;;
Actually, I'm doing a whole lot better at Apex on ps4 than pc as I figured <@416803598173995018>;;
Good good <@348165887347523594>;;
Yes I love watching it! <@348165887347523594>;;
It's installing;;
Maybe we could one time have a dongle royale;;
Same thing here <@524820041976250368> . I watch gaming streams way more than I actually do play games.;;
I love my new internet, like I installed kingdom come deliverance with all dlc's in like 10mins;;
<@!498246547838992414> We are ready for dongle royal....or maybe dongled battle royal;;
<@!498246547838992414> damn, now I'm really sad;;
I suck at battle royales lmao;;
Why <@348165887347523594>;;
My internet as been broken for almost two days now;;
I also just glanced at the sadness that is  my origin library... 1 game: the sims 4;;
Considering all I did lately to have a good bandwidth and all the money I invested on it...It's extremely frustrating;;
Damn that sucks <@348165887347523594>;;
I was living the dream for about 3 days...than boom, shit went down the drain yesterday .;;
Damn reality check;;
sorry to interrupt the conversation, but RE2 then0;;
?;;
That is horrible <@348165887347523594>;;
Your asking about what game you should play <@488734758847905803> ?;;
<@!498246547838992414> I just read you comment about your origin library üòÇ üòÇ;;
I have fooking 660 hours in that dang game;;
It was my first ever proper pc game;;
Daaaaeeemn;;
I see;;
Also, apex is installed, but I'm gonna play roblox with friends;;
So prolly tomorrow;;
Alright;;
yeah <@348165887347523594>;;
Maybe zero first...see if it catches people's attention...If not jump to the remake;;
I'm not sure;;
<@488734758847905803> when you going live?;;

<@416803598173995018> I'm much better on ps4 than pc though. I still suck but not as bad as I do on origin;;
<@409836692158021632> üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;
That was hillarious !!!! Good fucking clip;;
haha;;

üçä üçä üçä;;
hahaha;;
<@348165887347523594> Id have to imagine this game is easier with a controller though, Im no expert lol;;
<@409836692158021632> lol sneaky Russian!;;
oh my god that clip is amazing;;
<@488734758847905803> ;;
The Apex Legends stream with you, <@416803598173995018> and <@348165887347523594> was really really fun to watch!;;
If you guys can make that into a regular thing then imo, that would be awesome!;;
I agree! With <@409836692158021632>;;
<@409836692158021632> we are going to try! Get other people her involved also. That was a blast! Most fun Ive had streaming so far;;
and thank you <@409836692158021632> and <@524820041976250368>;;

<@416803598173995018> we should for sure;;
I think its a good idea! Do a different game each week maybe or something?;;
Let's pick a day that isn't Friday if possible hahaha;;
Usually on Fridays I'll be out of the house;;
Sure!;;
yeah we can figure out details later but at its core, its a great idea;;
Also yeah, Fridays arent great for me either lol;;
Wednesdays are my best days right now I think or Mondays;;
Im rewatching the broadcast now lol. Mostly consists of <@488734758847905803> being anxious and saying we arent in the circle guys! and oh god I'm dead! lmao that was genuinely the most fun Ive had streaming and the most fun Ive had gaming in quite awhile;;
Also, I am AWFUL with the sniper rifle in that game lol;;

Good night guys..hopeful to catch some early morning streams later..;;
Good night  <@526319824704634881>;;
Haha you're not the one who love to sleep to the sound of my voice  <@524820041976250368>. Join  <@348165887347523594> cult;;
Haha your voice is pretty soothing! I was tryin to stay awake the whole stream tho! <@207416847019016202>;;
haha thanks <@524820041976250368>;;
it was pretty good stream i think;;
hey guys, what's up?;;
still got about 2 hours left of work;;
will be streaming at around 3pm  EST;;
7pm London time;;
and 12pm California time;;
I dont know what time that is in cold dead area <@207416847019016202>;;
well you ignorant fuck <@488734758847905803>;;
i know your time üòÄ;;
hahahaha;;
are you 4 hours ahead?;;
or 6?;;
5 hours;;
just looked it up;;
ok so that's 22h for you (10pm);;
there is 8 hours difference between cali and london. but judging by your messages - 7;;
isn't it 7:15 for you?;;
19:15;;
It's 2:16 for me;;
I just use EST because most people are in the states;;
Its 19:17 for me, 16:17 for london and 8:17 for cali;;
so it will be 11 am for cali, not 12pm;;
that what i meant;;
at 3pmest  it isnt 12pm in cali?;;
damn;;
i dont know about est, i just know that in 3 hours it will be 11am in cali;;
I see;;
thanks;;
Timezones make my head hurt;;
lol;;
i just realised i forgot to thank <@272988530278662146> for joining my stream today;;
theres no excuse for me;;
Morning all! Or afternoon, evening, whatever I don‚Äôt care;;
i dont care about your too, weak american <@416803598173995018>;;
I am weak. I couldn‚Äôt stay awake for your stream last night. I‚Äôm disappointed in myself;;
yeah, everybody is disappointed in you;;
we need shame emojii;;
american shame emojii;;
found it üèà;;
If you ever played American football you would never associate it with shame;;
ü§†;;
This one is better;;
Lol;;
lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
Hope you all are having a good day! @everyone;;
great chill day;;
and you <@524820041976250368> ?;;
I just woke up again haha! But good so far! I think all that no sleep is catching up with meüòÇ <@278571432588345345> that‚Äôs fantastic to hear! Hopefully I‚Äôll be able to watch streams today! I wish twitch would fix whatever is going on;;
Lol yeah <@345380744375566338> is right;;
I was revered when I played American football lol;;
I've made friends here in Germany who have played American football and give it respect.;;
Good job <@!345380744375566338>, your dongle just grew to 2!;;
<@136319407491121152> didn't get your invite to origin;;
chicken and cheese with bacon bits and sausage gravy over the top;;
ill just let that sit there if anyones hungry  <:chickn4Glazed:542072320311951370>;;
<@345380744375566338> another German person in here?? I feel so at home! lol my grandmother and her family immigrated to america in 1953 from Germany;;
Good job <@!416803598173995018>, your dongle just grew to 18!;;
Yeah 18!!!;;
Geez is a huge one;;
Still not as big as oranges;;
haha yeah well at least it's something;;
<@416803598173995018> ich bin Deutsch nicht. I just moved here. I've lived all over the world. I was actually born and raised in Philly. My grandparents came over from Puerto Rico in in the 60's.;;
Oh right you did say that the other day I think a twitch chat. My bad! Lol;;
<@345380744375566338> you live in Germany?! I‚Äôve always wanted to go there!;;
Whoop whoop! <@416803598173995018>;;
Which part of Germany btw ?;;
I can figuratively walk to germany <@524820041976250368>;;
Hamburg;;
North. Moin Moin.;;
I was living in Cambodia before this, so major change.;;
<@524820041976250368> nice city. Has a little bit of everything. It's pretty cold and wet here during the winter though.;;
My mother is from K√∂ln;;
I have a lot of family that still lives in Germany. Sadly don't get to see/talk to them much;;
Shame. Where do you live if you don't mind?;;
I live in the states.;;
Ok. It's worth visiting the mother land. Sadly many Americans never get to enjoy or get to experience their roots. I've been fortunate to travel all over. It really helps your prospective in life and great memories.;;
I lived in Germany when I was young, but haven't had a chance to go back since. Well, I was going to, but my ex kind of ruined that plan;;
Ah ok. Sucks. Well hopefully in the future.;;
Hey wazzup all;;
<@348165887347523594> dongle is down at the moment. But maybe later tonight.;;
I still wanna visit Germany! <@345380744375566338>;;
It's great come on over;;
And hey! <@348165887347523594> how‚Äôre you?;;
Hopefully one day! <@345380744375566338>;;
you quoted the wrong guy <@524820041976250368>;;
by the way, better come to russia haha;;
Haha thanks when I click a name sometimes it hits the wrong one lol <@207416847019016202> and id love to come to Russia too! I‚Äôve always wanted to travel;;
<@524820041976250368> I'm good, how are you beautiful?;;
Pretty good! I think the no sleeping caught up with me lol I‚Äôm so tired! <@348165887347523594> I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre doing good!;;
i came up with a way to do single command for each of you, and that command will give you random response. now i need just come up with responses <@524820041976250368>  <@348165887347523594> <@416803598173995018> <@409836692158021632> <@488734758847905803>;;
That‚Äôs awesome! <@207416847019016202>;;
yeah i hope;;
i liked my bot today, especially when he talked with <@526319824704634881>;;
I bet that was fun!;;
haha yeah;;
Lol nice <@207416847019016202> can‚Äôt wait to see them;;
yeah i got couple of great ones for  purple friend;;
How‚Äôre you? <@416803598173995018>;;
for you i need to think yet;;
Wazzaaaaap <@348165887347523594>;;
<@!498246547838992414> where do you live?;;
Belgium, Limburg to be exact, It's the most eastern province of Flanders;;
Oh wow! <@!498246547838992414> that‚Äôs awesome!;;
It is!! I'm close to the Netherlands, Germany and The country of Luxemburg;;
So... Cheese, Beer and wine all close together;;
Haha that‚Äôs fantastic! <@!498246547838992414>;;
Belgium is a great place to live, you're basically in the heart of europe;;
There‚Äôs a lot of places I wanna visit!;;
Whatever you do, go anywhere else but Limburg <@524820041976250368>;;
There's nothing here, but bycicle paths;;
lol nice <@207416847019016202> I‚Äôm good <@524820041976250368> ! How are you? Busy day for me today;;
Why‚Äôs that? <@!498246547838992414>;;
And kinda busy as well but keeping up with chat as much as possible! <@416803598173995018> I‚Äôm doing great tho!;;
Shazam!;;
<@524820041976250368> where are you from, and why haven't you traveled?;;
Because Limburg isn't a really special province, It doesn't have anything noteworthy in it <@524820041976250368> It's just plain boring here;;
Just haven‚Äôt been able to! <@345380744375566338> and oh okay <@!498246547838992414>;;
Lemme do the orange panty thing now <@207416847019016202>;;
I feel like doing it;;
do it! <@!498246547838992414>;;
Good job <@!207416847019016202>, your dongle just grew to 27!;;
thats good message to grow;;
hahha;;
27;;
careful not to join the 27 club;;
these dongle numbers are compensating for something..;;
<@!498246547838992414> are you going to wear... <@207416847019016202> 's panties?;;
i dont wear any <@488734758847905803>;;
you dirty orange;;
no im clean!;;
maybe on the outside you are;;
but your soul is panty-less;;
my soul, and inside of my body, are both nasty;;
hahah;;
In mother russia, pig is you;;
yeah i am;;
hahaah;;
It is done;;
Hahaha;;
Weird that <@207416847019016202> wants me so close to his dongle and dongle hole;;
But hey I'm flattered that when you look at your dongle the first thing you'll see is me hahaha;;
what is dongle hole?;;
can somebody show me a picture?;;
<@488734758847905803> I'm doing something else...;;
I think it's clever;;
dongle hole is 180 degrees from your dongle;;
hey guys;;
kingdom hearts or RE2?;;
or something else?;;
RE2;;
Good job <@!345380744375566338>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
are you going to laugh when i scream like a bitch?;;
lol <@488734758847905803> I think I might be the only to get the 27 club comment;;
yeah I think so too lol;;
do you like sublime?;;
Now I‚Äôm sad lol. It really is freaky though, the 27 club I mean;;
bradley nowell turned 28 a week before he died;;
Of course;;
I knew you were good people;;
Yeah sad man. Contain, lane Staley. So many greats;;
I love music;;
Cobain* stupid autocorrect;;
cobain was a feelzbad;;
do you think he did it?;;
Nope;;
or did someone off him?;;
Murdered for sure;;
No one wipes a shotgun and the shells off before they kill themselves;;
you know what hits me harder than cobain?;;
Chris Cornell;;
Oh fuck dude;;
or after for that matter right? hahha;;
I legit cried when he died;;
same!;;
holy shit;;
he had a fucking show planned for braizl;;
with soundgarden;;
subnautica <@488734758847905803>;;
that dude was a living legend;;
I thought he had made it. Had a family, was still making great music. I was on my way into work when I heard it on the radio and I had to pull over and breathe;;
too late <@207416847019016202> , <@345380744375566338> hath spoken;;
yeah that shit was crazy;;
fucked up my whole day;;
üëé;;
I watched black hole sun like 50 times that day;;
I saw him once when soundgarden reunited;;
lucky;;
I wish i had;;
i love them;;
I get dem feelz;;
I didnt like linkin park anymore, but chester bennington dying also sucked;;
they were a big part of my teens;;
Fucked my year up dude. Soundgarden got me into grunge and basically formed my musical taste and how I played guitar;;
Yeah that was sad too. Killed him self on Cornell‚Äôs bday;;
cornell was his kids' godfather;;
Yeah. Fucking sad man;;
Brad Pitt was his best friend too. The pics of Pitt and Cornell‚Äôs kids is gut wrenching.;;
Wasn‚Äôt old enough to see most of the grunge bands sadly. Would have killed to see Alice In Chains too. The one band I had a chance to see, that I didn‚Äôt was rage against the machine. Almost went to a concert but couldn‚Äôt afford it at the time and then they broke up a few months later. Fucking sucked;;
Oh and I‚Äôm from Texas! <@345380744375566338>;;
Hey! <@488734758847905803>;;
hey <@524820041976250368> !;;
I'm live now guys!;;
When I get home I‚Äôll come watch! It‚Äôll be a lil bit! <@488734758847905803>;;
awesome!;;
I‚Äôll try to tune in but I‚Äôm out trying to get my fianc√© a car lol so might not be able to. Sorry mango!;;
Thats so sweet! <@416803598173995018>;;
no one is getting car for me and <@524820041976250368> , fuck thos cruel world;;
Lol <@207416847019016202> if I had the money I‚Äôd get you a car! But I don‚Äôt even have a car of my own anymore;;
yeah, and that what sad! <@524820041976250368>;;
<@524820041976250368> Oh damn, that sucks;;
but if to be honest, i dont want a car;;
Yeah it does! I mean I have cars to drive but they aren‚Äôt actually mine! <@!498246547838992414> but hopefully soon I‚Äôll be able to get one. I have one in Missouri that‚Äôs mine but it‚Äôs currently broke down. And <@207416847019016202> why not?;;
no reason for me honestly;;
metro and all other transport works fine in moscow;;
get anywhere by metro is way easier that wait in traffic jams;;
also, i dont know how to drive, but given city im live in, i have no reason to learn;;
Oh okay didn‚Äôt know;;
didnt know that in big city can be convinient public transport system? üòÄ  <@524820041976250368>;;
<@207416847019016202> how much is car there?;;
Yes she would use public transport if it was convenient here but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a very bad system;;
Yes! <@207416847019016202>;;
haha here imo its pretty good;;
i dont know much about cars, but i would say starting from 7-10 k bucks, the worst cars <@416803598173995018>;;
https://yandex.ru/metro/moscow?ncrnd=5267;;
moscow metro map;;
I like <@207416847019016202> but I cannot afford that, sorry my brother;;
Yeah transit system is good over there and Europe. Its good where I used to live in Boston but very bad here in Los Angeles;;
what is you cant afford? <@416803598173995018>;;
car in russia?;;
Car in Russia and car here lol. I think I would do better with getting my fiance a car, rather than getting you one;;
everybody here has it;;
i dont know how;;
Seems tough to own car there;;
yeah;;
but still everybody has it;;
i earn more that average and i never knew how i could make enough to buy a car;;
what is Texas like <@524820041976250368> ?;;
do you ride horses to work and shit;;
xD;;
In my experience having lived in Kansas City and visited friends in Colorado, Kansas, and Texas, they don't have great public transport systems. The east coast Northern cities have really good systems similar to Europe.;;
exactly <@345380744375566338>;;
California has shit transit system too, except san fransisco;;
yeah thats actually very strange to hear;;
im used to think about US as of convinient country;;
but moscow is honetsly great;;
Just the big important cities;;
Los Angeles isnt important?;;
The rest is relatively very small and not too advanced or up to date;;
lol not even <@345380744375566338> Los Angeles is very important I guess and transit here is awful;;
Yes of course. What I am saying is many cities don't really have all these things.;;
I'm not saying LA isn't important. It's just congested. I was answering Orange's question.;;
ahhh I understand now, sorry. LA is beyond congested, car traffic is here is so bad;;
If they had better transit, traffic wouldnt be as bad lol;;
I lived in Bangkok. That city is twice the size of LA and they make it work because they have a great Public transit system.;;
thats cool <@345380744375566338>;;
That's my other language I can speak. I can read basic text as well. German would be my fourth language when I finally get it down.;;
hey all;;
I had was on a server saving mission all day;;
did it survive? <@348165887347523594>;;
<@278571432588345345> no I don‚Äôt ride horses to work! And haven‚Äôt rode any horses since I was little. Texas is alright it gets super hot here during the summer. Winters aren‚Äôt bad tho. I kinda miss Missouri tho more laid back and chill there. Where I live I don‚Äôt really associate with the neighbors around here cause they ain‚Äôt good people to chill with. I don‚Äôt really have friends here most of my friends are in Missouri. But that‚Äôs okay! And <@345380744375566338> I miss kc! I stayed there for a month with a friend!;;
aww that kinda sucks;;
I was fucking with you with the horses;;
its like the perception of texas from the outside;;
from watching texas ranger lol;;
Haha I know. Although I would love to ride horses everywhere! And lmao! I haven‚Äôt seen that show in forever!;;
for what its worth I also never found people irl that share my passion for gaming and other things, so these online communities have been a massive thing for me;;
actually finding like-minded people to talk to and hang out with;;
Same thing for me <@278571432588345345>;;
Yes for sure! I really enjoy this online community! I use to be the super shy girl that never put myself out there or associated with many people but ever since I got into supporting gamers my whole world had changed and I absolutely love it!;;
Yeah, I'm still a bit shy irl, and I hated everything to do with life before I began watching youtube and twitch, so I try to support as much as I can as well;;
I love this as well;;
I've met so many wonderful people over Stream, discord, etc;;
Same here! All the discord‚Äôs I‚Äôm in have a lot of amazing people in them and I love chatting with everyone of you!;;
aww <:jamminjonny:536237981325852672>;;

I am following Medusa‚Äôs but I didn‚Äôt have the live notifications turned on! They are now tho!;;

I bet it is !! But I got no one of you in my ps friends ...!!;;
Oh and I started a huge diet with specialist ... it cost a lot but worth it they are having an eye on me all the time and after a week it pays off already;;
Oh no! Add me. My name is Changeover21 on there;;

Team orange role when? <@488734758847905803>;;
haha;;
<@207416847019016202> still playing games, just no streaming?;;
Yeah;;
I can't stream when my gf is sleeping;;
And streaming take a lot of energy;;
Off stream you can just chill;;
And run game and then do something else;;
Yup. That's why I never stream. My wife is sleeping when I have free time to play;;
Yeah;;
And during the day I need to pay attention to my children.;;
Recently I streamed only when he wasn't home;;
But now we managed to do it when she's home;;
*she;;
She doesn't hate you too much then.;;
üëå;;
üòÇ;;
I would just like to stream not for money or anything but just to chat.;;
She loves to listen first couple of hours, while my voice is okay;;
But it's too much work and again I don't have time or set up for it.;;
Yeah I do it just for chat;;
So you chat and send me the money;;
Good job <@!345380744375566338>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
That's very cool message to grow dongle;;
Bot encourage bullying haha;;
Haha.;;
I'm playing pillars now. Lots of fun.;;
First pillars of eternity?;;
I need to finish it;;
And instead in playing Wolfenstein;;
Yes. I have the same problem I try to finish most games. RPG are very hard to finish.;;
Exactly;;
Tyranny is one of the few that I finished almost non stop;;

Morning fellas! üêº;;
morning panda <@455797717763883009>;;
How you doing  <@207416847019016202>?;;
I'm pumped to see how this week's releases fare;;
I'm good  <@455797717763883009>;;
To be honest I wait nothing of list that come out in near weeks/months;;
I have Gamepass, so if Crackdown performs well I might jump into it;;
Still finishing Odyssey;;
Hm;;
I finished Odyssey long ago;;
I stopped it when RDR2 released;;
Me too. But after finishing rdr2 I finished odyssey;;
And i have no idea what crackdown is;;
I went on a long holiday after I finished Rdr2.;;
Haha;;
Did you check out this new apex thing that everyone except me playing these days?;;
Haha I ain't playing that;;
üëç;;
Good morning mango seeds!;;
I'm kinda tired so to wake up I'm gonna play a round or two in Apex;;
Then do more work;;
you work better after suffering a little? <@488734758847905803>;;
thats why you always check length of your dongle in the morning?;;
Morning everyone. Well its the afternoon here.;;
morning <@345380744375566338>;;
How is Mother Russia?;;
Haha <@207416847019016202> I ignore my dongle completely so it doesn't destroy my day;;
But thanks for reminding me hahha;;
Hey <@345380744375566338>;;
<@488734758847905803> WHat up my homie?;;
Just kinda tired and waking up to some Apex;;
Hbu ?;;
slow day of work. Chinese new year isn't quiet over so my regular students are on vacation.;;
russia is okay today thanks <@345380744375566338>;;
Is that good or bad <@345380744375566338> ?;;
The good and bad of being a teacher;;
Well I don't get paid if I don't teach, but its good to get a break here and there.;;
There are only two big breaks like this a year;;
July and now I presume?;;
why july?;;
im trying to remember what special is in july...;;
American school system they get the summer off;;
russian too. but whole summer, not just july;;
But chinese school system not as much days off.  However they get Chinese New Year, and some other festivals here and there. They have a National Day which turns into a week.;;
That's in October.;;
Good  afternoon @everyone. How long did it generally take people to figure out a good streaming schedule? Many thankings.;;
As long I've got small kids around I'll never able to find one good steady schedule, and that's fine enough;;
I see. Interesting <@345380744375566338> ;;
;;
<@537319907541516311> , it took me about a month or so to understand how long I could stream and at what time;;
haha good question, i will never come up with good schedule until i will start work from home;;
now it all depends on work a lot;;
but basically i realised that i should consider timezones of people who is watching me;;
<@87241615671832576> I feel you bro;;
;;
I think to know you own schedule. I'd say there's some factors going in.;;
Like what can you controle and what can't you. How much can you stream at a certain quality and for how long can you retain your core audience;;
Morning @everyone;;
morning <@524820041976250368>;;
hows your morning;;
I‚Äôm so tired, I finally passed out around 5ish and had to get up an hour later. How‚Äôre you? <@207416847019016202>;;
im very good, will go home soon;;
That‚Äôs great! Are you streaming today?;;
no, will stream tomorrow;;
in 26 hours;;
Okay! Can‚Äôt wait! How‚Äôs your day been?;;
good, been working whole day;;
I can‚Äôt wait to start working again! In a way it‚Äôs gonna suck trying to keep up with discord but at the same time I need the job. I wish I could just work from home;;
hey <@524820041976250368>;;
how's your uncle <@524820041976250368> ?;;
I‚Äôm not sure, wasn‚Äôt able to visit due to him being transferred to another unit haven‚Äôt found out anything yet gonna call when I get back home and see if I can get any info <@488734758847905803> how‚Äôre you?;;
I'm good. still working;;
so frustrating;;
I'm sorry to hear that about your uncle;;
Oh man im sorry! What exact work are you doing? And thank you it‚Äôs okay I think the reason they transferred him to another unit it is because he‚Äôs supposed to be taking classes to help be eligible for parole again. Last unit he was at he got screwed over cause of a guard and the took away his parole.;;
I am doing the Pele transcriptions still;;
Dream job for <@488734758847905803>;;
oh damn, that sucks <@524820041976250368> üò¶;;
actually <@207416847019016202>;;
I don't hate pele as much anymore haha;;
since I started working on his interview;;
I actually feel kinda bad for having been so angry at him;;
he's a really simple guy froma  very poor background;;
I still think he should have done something, but it's like he isn't aware of it;;
a reporter said something interesting about racism in Brazil;;
that racism is more social than racial;;
so, a poor white guy will be treated mostly the same as a poor black guy.;;
and a well-dressed black guy will be treated mostly the same as a well-dressed white guy.;;
People care how much money you have.;;
;;
It ends up being a racist act because most of the country's poor population is black;;
"that racism is more social than racial
so, a poor white guy will be treated mostly the same as a poor black guy.
and a well-dressed black guy will be treated mostly the same as a well-dressed white guy";;
so wheres the racism?;;
Well, I said mostly the same;;
and if black people are the ones who are most affected, then - because of the history behind it - I feel like there are racist characterizations;;
characteristics*;;
Yeah. And oh wow, have you slept yet? <@488734758847905803>;;
I have, but only a little;;
sorry, didnt understand... basically, if i hate poor (for example), and poor man happens to be black - im a racist? <@488734758847905803>;;
Oh I‚Äôm sorry;;

Sorry to hear your computer crashed again <@348165887347523594>;;
Good morning everyone;;
hello;;
hey @everyone - instead of using the mango council, I figured we'd let you decide who will be streamer of the week. https://www.strawpoll.me/17410495;;
;;
This way 100% of the members have the chance to be streamer of the week.;;
Please choose 4 (FOUR) options only.;;
I didn't have time to write everybody's name, so if there's someone there that you want to vote for, just tell me in DM;;
There s one guy;;
Purple something;;
He s not on the list;;
haha;;
I won't be considered of course ll;;
lol*;;
Going good so far! <@348165887347523594> hope you are having a wonderful day too!;;
Good job <@!524820041976250368>, your dongle just grew to 13!;;
That's massive  <@524820041976250368>;;
Lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
My office is a shed out back, it's not fully insulated yet and I don't have a sweater... So I can see my breath when I breathe out. ;_;
<@314733038854602752> <:wordsfRip:537938604568084480> time for a heated blanket;;
Right? I was going to put on gloves but they are too thick to type with so I have to find the ones I used to wear when I lived in place with snow;;
I have a scarf too.;;
I forgot to turn my wax burner off on Saturday and the wax is still mostly solid;;
I would also probably temporarily move offices;;
lol;;
I voted, did you? Make Gaming micro- transaction free Again.;;
I can't <@311684705810513921>;;
<@314733038854602752> that's rough. I hate the cold so I'd be miserable;;
I'm in california it'll warm up eventually but right now I'm so bundled;;
Except for gloves cause hte ones I have out here are too thick to let me type;;

No, it was should I:;;
Play what I want?;;
Play what is most popular?;;
Pick a game at random?;;
The first person picked random and the other two picked what I want.;;
So I'm going to stream a random game on monday (Legit put my list in a randomizer and pick the top one) and play what I want the other two days;;
Oh i remember that;;

My mom in law is like that;;
Yes yes very much busy <@416803598173995018>;;
I‚Äôve taken 2 weeks away from twitch to get it all done;;
She always asks me if things are too spicy but I like spicy so things that are spicy for her are like, nothing to me, I don't notice it;;
This is hot enough it burns my tongue to drink water.;;

hahaha thanks <@409836692158021632>;;
Hello! <@87241615671832576>;;
What are we up to today?;;
I played apex can you imagine  <@87241615671832576>;;
Did you like it?;;
I don't know. All I can say that I left in panic just first two games. Other several matches I managed to play until death;;
Just hopping thru streams! What about you? <@87241615671832576>;;
I really enjoy watching people play apex! <@207416847019016202>;;
Oh, so you have games that you prefer more  <@524820041976250368>;;
My personal favourite game to watch is Skyrim;;
Ehh sometimes but I‚Äôll watch any gameplay! <@207416847019016202> I really like horror. And <@!498246547838992414> I haven‚Äôt watched that.;;
Maybe it's because it's your favourite game  <@498246547838992414>;;
Do you consider dead space being horror  <@524820041976250368>;;
I am preparing for streaming some Euklidian skies <@524820041976250368> I've been looking forward to try out this indie game.;;
True true <@207416847019016202> and your really should check it out <@524820041976250368> Skyrim streamers mostly have great chat interaction;;
Yes and no, I don‚Äôt get scared easily. But that game is awesome to watch! <@207416847019016202>;;
Well I watch only streamers from our discord so you play it  <@498246547838992414>;;

what time would you be free?;;
also, I have a question for all of you.;;
@everyone - what do you think about making the Mango Tree be a twitch stream team?;;
I'm just wondering if it's time or if I should wait a little bit more;;
Trust your gut;;
I'm in a lot of teams, and senior staff in one of the ones you're already in... Or not, I'm not sure ... I just know you're in Rise.;;
It's a lot of work;;
I think it'd be cool  <@488734758847905803> you've got a bunch of streamers in here;;
Be I still as long as you can. Once you go corporate there is no going back.;;
Solo I meant.;;
true <@314733038854602752> , I am in rise;;
haha true that <@345380744375566338>;;
Are you in TSSN still ?;;
Good job <@!314733038854602752>, your dongle just grew to 6!;;
Woo;;
<@488734758847905803> I‚Äôm gonna be on today around 1500-1515 my time;;
Kinda <@314733038854602752> , i'm in the discord;;
I'm the head moderator and one of the senior staff in that one. XD;;
but honestly I dont really go in there much;;
oh nice;;
It's okay, it's a lot of drama right now;;
Also yeah I think it would be cool but it is a lot of work;;
maybe we can play a match or two <@416803598173995018>;;
why's that <@314733038854602752> ?;;
I‚Äôd obviously join if you did it;;
Ok cool. I‚Äôll hit you up when I go on;;
cool!;;
Because all of the divisions leaving to become their own communities and some of the people trying to draw lines and make people pick sides.;;
That's the best answer I can give while...;;
yeah no need to go into details;;
I think it's all stupid, work as a group and support each other, why make enemies and tell people they can't enjoy each other;;
Yeah seriously <@314733038854602752>;;
Precisely!!  <@314733038854602752>;;
My problem is the teams are so massive. I‚Äôm in rise and tssn and oreocide just invited me to illuminate. It‚Äôs too much lol. I can‚Äôt keep track of everyone or keep up with peoples streams etc;;
<@488734758847905803> imo no need to rush into it;;
"give it a bit more time and once you have a steady reliable ""roster"" then go for it";;
true true.;;
thanks guys!;;
I think youre all right. I'll wait;;
but glad to hear there are some peeps excited for when we push the trigger;;
Yass;;
Yeah <@409836692158021632> nailed it. Yeah I‚Äôd definitely be down for it!;;
<@416803598173995018> most of the people are in all the others, so you meet the same people everywhere. Like <@311684705810513921> is a mod for me in TSSN so I know him and I'm sure if I look through the member list I'll recognize tons of people.;;
I'm only affiliated, just started streaming after like 8 months, but I sound like an old wise man cause I've been in support networks for so long now. ;_;
*master yoda*  <@314733038854602752>;;
<@314733038854602752> lol yeah thats true, I do see alot of the same people in the other discords;;
I'm not in any of the division discords though because they didn't really seem keen on having me in there anyway and I'm sure that they would of kicked me out when they seperated because I'm opinionated and they know that. :x;;
Appareantly I'm intimidating, I'm not sure who started that rumour, but as far as anyone is concerned I'm just going to say it's true.;;
Yeah Im scared of you;;
Sarcasm is so hard to sense through text lol so I am only joking;;
lol yeah I know that fear <@416803598173995018>;;
I have no fear <@488734758847905803>;;
What is the point of twitch teams?  <@488734758847905803>;;
Like, seriously, I don't know about it;;
To my knowledge, it's like a way to support the group (in this case our group);;
have  more people know about the team;;
And since our discord already has name Mango Tree, i would go with something else;;
Anybody wanna play apex on ps4?;;
so having like Team Mango or whatever there,;;
having mango art;;
hey <@297612307423297536>;;

lol seriously. Its a really addictive game;;
<@488734758847905803> Not sure if I can make it this stream, mate;;
My eyes are slowly closing;;
Hope you all are having a wonderful day/night!;;
I'm <@524820041976250368>;;
Hope yours is as good üòâ;;
*yawn*;;
I'm doing good  <@524820041976250368>;;
It's getting hard to fallow you <@!498246547838992414>;;
Why?  <@348165887347523594>;;
I passed out just woke up with a massive headache <@348165887347523594> and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre doing good! <@!498246547838992414>;;
All thse name change;;
Jesus, take care if yourself  <@524820041976250368>;;
Ahh, yeah  <@348165887347523594> I'm a bit of a shapeshifter;;
Keep a name bro;;
why did you passed out? <@524820041976250368>;;
his current name is cool <@348165887347523594>;;
That's boring  <@348165887347523594>;;
Everyone should put #teamorange before their name;;
I understand that though;;
Mango would shit himself;;
ill put #kellyd before;;
but everyone should;;
lol;;
Lol I‚Äôm trying! I‚Äôve just been super tired here lately and not sleeping caught up with me I tried so hard to stay awake <@!498246547838992414> and <@207416847019016202> just couldn‚Äôt stay awake!;;
Get some sleep  <@524820041976250368>, your health is the most important!!;;
Wow, everyone here has their face as a profile pic;;
I feel left out;;
Aha all of you are more important to me than sleeping!;;
you have no face? <@!498246547838992414>;;
Well, that's really nice  <@524820041976250368> but I still think sleep is important, try to find a good balance, so you don't pass out as much;;
I don't <@207416847019016202>;;
It‚Äôs hard cause I wanna be able to watch everyone‚Äôs streams and support them. Which a lot of people stream during my sleeping hours so I just choose not to sleep <@!498246547838992414>;;
Now that, that's a situation right there;;
I'd suggest getting a day's rest once in a while though;;
<@207416847019016202> enjoying Apex? Didn't think it was your kind of game.;;
But it's nice that you want to support everyone, just sleeping is really important  <@524820041976250368>;;
Take it from me;;
its not my kind, but i want to try it with guys <@345380744375566338>;;
so for now i need to get used to it;;
i even stopped panic;;
I know! I‚Äôve slept about 3ish hours in the past couple days gonna try to sleep tonight!  <@!498246547838992414>;;
thanks for joining me guys;;
had an incredible time today playing RE2;;
also happy to raid our streamer of the week hal;;
really enjoy his streams;;
My dog totally convinced me to take a long nap today;;
convincing dog haha;;
"Right? I was just relaxing browsing the internet and he was like ""yo, take a nap"" and all the sudden I was alseep";;
happens to me all the time;;
but instead of the dog its usually my gf;;
lol;;
Anyone around for some apex on ps4?;;
I wish...;;
lol me too man! We gotta try and play together sometime;;
when do you usually go on?;;
I go super late man. Like 11pm.;;
but I might try a little earlier tonight;;
You play on Fridays at all?;;
Since I work so damn early during the week, its tough for me to stay up but Im up late on Fridays usually;;
yeah I do Fridays;;
I'll try and catch you then;;
Sweet, yeah I should be around Friday;;
I like getting home early but getting up early really sucks;;
<@207416847019016202> what should I title my stream today?;;
American with sweet beautiful voice plays weak battle royale;;
too many words;;
not all americans will read it to end;;
lol yeah we are too lazy;;
watch and get pregnant;;
lmao;;
Laziness kills with voice;;
or marks variant is better;;
actually one of my changeovers commands is about pregnancy too;;
üòÇ;;
lol is it really?;;
of course;;
I feel like watch and get pregnant might drive people away haha;;
you just didnt try them all;;
but maybe you will help some family <@416803598173995018>;;
who wanted baby for a long time;;
lol but I dont want any kids;;
cant afford that shit;;
sorry man i cant take it seriously;;
you complained about gas one time, and then it turned out gas in russia 4 times expensive, with salaries 4 times smaller, so it 16 times worse;;
yeah thats true;;
"no offense, but after that i hear from you every day ""cant afford that cant afford this""";;
I shouldnt complain about that stuff;;
i dont say you shouldnt;;
but i cant take it seriously;;
ahh ok I see. Fair enough. Still need a title for my stream lol;;
I cant think of anything;;
"how about ""lets discuss gas prices""";;
lol I think that would confuse people. What happened to mango? Thought he was going to be on soon;;
"or ""go murica""";;
he either got a new pile of work or got robbed <@488734758847905803>;;
He did say brazil was dangerous in some parts lol;;
"how about ""sexy voices and wins""?";;
its what he said to you specifically about rio i think;;
but apart from that he says every day that theres dangerous everywhere;;
"or ""trying make some kills with sexy voice""";;
ahhh yes you are correct. Yes everywhere is dangerous;;
lol I like the last one;;
Trying to get some kills with my sexy voice #teamorange;;
Yeah!!!!;;
Got team orange;;
haha you like?;;
Yea!!!;;
lol ok I put it on there. Im live now;;

What is it?;;
Koryu Uchinadi Kenpo Jutsu;;

plus some weaponry if you get far enough;;
Good job <@!442488674144223242>, your dongle just grew to 5!;;

Hey!  <@526319824704634881>;;
Hey <@524820041976250368> ! How are you? Were you able to get some sleep?;;
I‚Äôm good! I‚Äôve had about 3 hours of sleep in the past couple days lol <@526319824704634881> how‚Äôre you?;;
Wuuuuut?!;;
Just 3 hours? <@524820041976250368> how do you survive?;;
Lol I honestly don‚Äôt know;;
I'm good.. done with today's shift.. so going to chill..;;
<@524820041976250368> I'm concerned...you need sleep..;;
Good job <@!526319824704634881>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
Lol I know I do but that‚Äôs okay I‚Äôll be alright;;
Okay..rest everytime you have the chance..;;
I try to but I never have time lol;;
I don‚Äôt make the time tho I try to stay busy;;
So basically you don't like sleeping since you don't make the time to sleep? Lol..;;
<@217089479863697418> apex is really a lot of fun it's not perfect but does add things to the BR game type I play on both xbox and PC finding an actual group  is another thing and randoms that haven't played to much tend to dump before you can respawn they and you really are at a disadvantage at the end of the game if you don't have 3 people but it's been a fun game;;
Pretty much haha I rather be supporting then sleeping <@526319824704634881>;;
I think I got the opposite of insomnia lately...been wanting to sleep so much these past few weeks..;;
Yeah <@343707181377388544> I do really wish I could play solo;;
Sometimes but that isn't the way to win;;
Hey <@217089479863697418> and <@343707181377388544> !;;
Hey there <@526319824704634881>;;
Howdy!;;
Apex is fun to play with friends.. playing with randoms is frustrating sometimes..;;
I have really bad insomnia lol <@526319824704634881>;;
<@524820041976250368> same I do about 4 hours when I sleep no matter when I go to sleep;;
Work schedule doesn't help;;
Super bad insomnia you got there <@524820041976250368> .. I had insomnia last year..usually 7 hrs of sleep in 2 days..;;
Well here lately I haven‚Äôt been sleeping much due to supporting streamers lol I‚Äôve gotten so intrigued into it that I just don‚Äôt care to sleep. Lol <@526319824704634881> <@343707181377388544>;;
It will go two ways fit in a nap to recover some sleep when you can or go go till your body will make you sleep it's up to you at my worst   I was doing days up sleep for 30 min then kept going thinking I had slept was put on meds to sleep I got that bad be careful sleep is important for the body;;
Sleep is indeed important for the body..;;
Okay..let's tell all the streamers to stop streaming for 24hrs so <@524820041976250368> can sleep and recover.. lol;;
Had manic periods in my life not sure if you have the same problem but it's good to be careful;;
I am on meds to sleep I just forget to take them. I‚Äôve been just going and going until my body can‚Äôt take anymore. And no don‚Äôt do that!;;
There should just be an international sleep day;;
I‚Äôve gotta have streamers stream lol;;
Is it a medical condition which causes you not sleeping?;;
I‚Äôm not sure;;
There is  <@217089479863697418>  a siesta!;;
It was for me..meds helped me a lot..;;
<@526319824704634881> there are a few medical conditions that can cause Insomnia.;;
Yeah..I have a couple of illnesses that caused my insomnia..;;
But now I have the opposite.. it's like my body is alternating insomnia and hypersomnia every few months..;;
It's been over 10 years  since I was on meds.;;
<@526319824704634881> there could be other factors.;;
I haven‚Äôt been taking any of my meds. It‚Äôs been about a week since I‚Äôve taken them. But I‚Äôve always had problems sleeping was supposed to do a sleep study but haven‚Äôt been scheduled for one. But I go back Wednesday to my neurologist the one that prescribed my sleep meds;;
Diet, exercise, stress and sleep. <@526319824704634881>;;
Good job <@!343707181377388544>, your dongle just grew to 2!;;
Are the ones I focus on and try to stick to a routine everyday.;;
I'm glad things work out for you <@343707181377388544>.. that's my goal..to ultimately not rely on meds anymore...;;
<@524820041976250368> do you have an overactive mind? Always thinking about things when you do try to sleep.;;
Hope it goes well for you on Wednesday <@524820041976250368>;;
Yes I do that‚Äôs why I meditate <@343707181377388544>;;
And thank you it‚Äôs just my follow up <@526319824704634881> I suffer from massive migraines have for the past 12 years;;
<@526319824704634881> it's not perfect and don't recommend others try to do it, but I felt that I was numb on the meds and couldn't think like I use to, it killed all creatively and made me overweight. They had my on five different medications for this and that.;;
But if meds help you maybe reducing them could be a goal and their is nothing wrong if you need them.;;
Damn! 12 yrs of massive migraines! Is it getting better now? I can't imagine going through that.. I hate migraines..;;
That's a long time to suffer;;
No not as of yet. I‚Äôm on meds for my headaches that don‚Äôt work same with my sleep meds which is actually a antidepressant it doesn‚Äôt seem to help much either so hopefully Wednesday she‚Äôll change it to something else or figure something else out;;
I know what you mean <@343707181377388544> .. I was prescribed a med that killed my creativity..it was only giving me pointless energy..felt like a zombie;;
Good thing my doc agreed to take me off that medicine.. but I still take a fuckton of meds for my illnesses..;;
That's one thing that bothers me about meds the doctors just seem to guess what might work. Then you go back and oh that didn't work try this .;;
I take 8 meds everyday.. it sucks..but I need it at the moment.. but the goal is to eliminate it one by one..;;
Good job <@!526319824704634881>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
Yeah she does that most drs I‚Äôve been to do that to me. And I hope things get better for you.  <@526319824704634881>;;
I‚Äôm on about 10 meds not just for sleep and my migraines it‚Äôs for other things as well;;
Agree <@343707181377388544> .. it's trial and error for them..and we're suffering the side effects..;;
I remember being put on haldol and I was straight up drooling and he was maybe not that one let's try this.;;
Oh wow that‚Äôs not good I‚Äôve never had a med do that to me but I have a high tolerance on meds for some reason;;
Damn <@343707181377388544> !;;
I will say this if I get to a point where I'm no longer in control I will definitely go back on the meds as needed. This is something that I found out only last year runs in the family. No one in the family wanted to talk about it. Wish that mental illness wasn't such a taboo.;;
I'm on 2 benzos now and it's kinda working but me and my doc are careful since these stuff are addicting..;;
Agree! Mental illness is also a taboo here as well..;;
But I'm glad you found a system that works for you <@343707181377388544>;;
Thanks man good luck;;
I‚Äôm glad you found a system that works for you as well! <@343707181377388544> and I hope things get better for the both of you! <@526319824704634881>;;
You too <@524820041976250368> !;;
Same to you  <@524820041976250368>;;
If any of you wants to talk feel free to dm me anytime..;;
First conversation  to get to know you two but I'm glad we had it.;;
What kind of games are you guys into?;;
Morning everyone ;;
That was a heavy topic to wake up on :);;
Aww thanks! <@526319824704634881>;;
Morning! <@87241615671832576>;;
Morning <@87241615671832576> ! Sorry.. hehehehhe;;
No worry :) It's always nice to see how people open on and just talk about their lives;;
And I‚Äôm currently just a supporter so I watch people play any games! I like horror and action games the most tho! What games are you into? <@343707181377388544>;;
<@87241615671832576> what's up man;;
Good job <@!343707181377388544>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
<@343707181377388544> as of the moment my favorite game is Subnautica.. but I was super into CSGO a few years ago.. I love Portal 2 and Assassins Creed 2.. how about you?;;
I try to play anything and everything  I will give anything a try.;;
Also..I've been playing Apex as well.. it's fun with friends..;;
I just woke up <@343707181377388544> and getting ready to bring the kids to kindergarden;;
Apex is the game I think about when at work;;
<@87241615671832576> kids are a hand full  bless you sir;;
May the force be with you sir <@87241615671832576> ..;;
Use to take care of kids when I was younger;;
I might play Apex later if my internet will cooperate with me.. it's been shitty today..;;
Used to babysit  and run the church nursery;;
Wow.. you must have a lot of patience <@343707181377388544>;;
I need to do job appliances afterwards,  my head still spins after 8 hours of just doing that yesterday :);;
Hopefully you‚Äôll have a good day! And I on the other hand love kids! Took care of my nephews for 12 years! <@87241615671832576>;;
Still hate changing diapers to this day and hate avacado on my hand reminds me of baby ||poop||;;
Love kids as well;;
Lmao babies are the best and I don‚Äôt mind the diaper changing I‚Äôve gotten used to it with everyone around me having babies except myself lol;;
Thank you <@524820041976250368> right now I just wish my head did not feel like it was going to explode :);;
I like them older I must admit, I have to be able to do a conversation.;;
Oh man the last nap I had when I woke up my head felt like that it was horrible! I hope your head feels better quickly!;;
I love kids too..helped took care of my niece and nephew.. rn I sometimes babysit my 2yo nephew when I am able..;;
I'd estimate I just need water, so it going to be fine. But this day is going to be such a slow one.;;
Kid conversation are the best the honesty is the best;;
Kids are funny as well.. kids say the darnest things too..;;
I like all ages but have none of my own kinda doing me since I took care of my nephews from the age of 11 to 23. They are now 13 and 14 years old;;
And that‚Äôs true! <@343707181377388544> <@526319824704634881>;;
Well I am off for a while. I hope you all will have a great day/night if we do not see each other;;
Later  <@87241615671832576>;;
I hope you have a fantastic day! <@87241615671832576>;;
Hope you feel better <@87241615671832576> .. have an awesome day!;;
Question..do you stream too <@343707181377388544> ?;;
No I would like to but money and time don't allow me to at this time. But trying to get everything together to do it and I have noticed it helps to have a schedule and stick to it. Job needs me to be flexible and my schedule right now is two mids, one dinner, and two overnights.;;
What do you do for a living if you don't mind me asking? You don't have to answer if you don't want to.. üòä;;
Oh and I'm on contact for 50 hours a week;;
I manage a 4+ million a year restaurant;;
Oh wow that‚Äôs awesome! But I do hope that everything works out for you to become a streamer;;
Who knows even if I just did on the side for fun I would be happy games have helped me in life . They are a big part of my life and I believe they have positive effects towards peoples mental health.;;
Morning all you depressing seeds;;
Orange is here;;
<@207416847019016202>!!!!;;
Hey orange;;
I believe it too! <@343707181377388544>;;

You can go now;;

But I have been waiting for you haha;;
2 am is time for oranges, not for nerdies;;
Nerdies are always awake at 2amüòÇ;;
I'm here half an hour, I just was silent while keeping up with chat  <@524820041976250368>;;
Oh haha;;

So I woke up at 10 and now going to work;;

I'm gonna make the merch, write the about me, and do some bot commands this week since I won't be streaming;;
Awesome;;
No purple stream?;;
Not until Monday :(;;
Maybe I'll do a quick one today in a couple hours;;
busy with work?;;
No. Going to my in-laws' house to take care of my father in law who's sick;;
Their internet is the absolute worst;;
Makes me feel like I went back in time;;
Nah I'm  exaggerating a little bit;;
But it is bad;;
All the strength I can send you brother;;
Is it dongle strength or regular?;;
Both;;
Cause if it's regular I don't even wanna hear about it;;
Hahahaha;;
lol;;
Dongle;;
Some shit just happened in the house next door. This last weekend was very weird;;
What happened?;;
Yeah this weekend there was a witch on the loose as we say in Brazil;;
You sure you want to know?;;
Yeah...some weird weekend indeed;;
Can't say that's not intriguing haha;;
We just found my neighbor on the floor. I'm not sure yet what happened. But he is gone;;
I'm not sure what to think;;
Whoa that's crazy;;
Like dead?;;
I'm telling you...some weird weekend.;;
Yeah,, he is dead;;
Damn. Murder?;;
No;;
He passed  away.  But I don't know yet what happened. Maybe a cardiac arrest.  He was alone;;
Poor guy;;
Yeah...and he wasn't that old...in his 60s;;
That sucks. One shouldn't be alone, especially during that age;;
so true;;
Yeah that's sad af;;
tbh I probably will also be like that lol;;
minus the heart attack;;
no everyone ends up married with kids;;
Good morning everyone;;

Yeah <@278571432588345345> , I agree.  Carina and I dont plan on having kids;;
Hey <@287320205020102667> !;;

Morning all! <@488734758847905803> my fiance and I dont plan on having kids either, everyone gives us shit for it lol;;
What are the different categories  <@488734758847905803>?;;
Hey <@351323158826975232> , long time no see!;;
Hey to everyone I didn't see yet today;;
Hey  <@416803598173995018>  <@287320205020102667>  <@348165887347523594>;;
What do you mean <@455797717763883009> ?;;
Of roles?;;
Mango seeds are followers,;;
Bronze mangos are subscribers;;
Mods are moderators haha;;
Streamer of the week is the showcase of that week;;
And then there are a few custom roles I gave out to <@416803598173995018> <@278571432588345345> and <@502171199850414081>;;
Hey hey üëã;;
Same here <@416803598173995018>;;
It's hard to raise kids, and everyone says their parents could've done something differently;;
Morning my orange friend <@207416847019016202> <@287320205020102667> hey man! Glad to catch your stream last night, sorry I wasnt able to chat that much though;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah it's annoying;;
So my average viewer is up to almost 7 thanks to everyone here! Only 68 more average to go for partner! lol;;
Seriously though, thank you all so much. This is such an amazing and supportive community;;
My In-laws are the ones who are really sad that we won't have kids;;
We love you only for your voice, So don't get all hyped  <@416803598173995018>;;
Dude that's awesome <@416803598173995018> !;;
Once you'll lose your voice- you'll lose us;;
That's fine, if my voice can get me partner then Im ok with that lol;;
Lol;;
<@207416847019016202> Ill never lose my voice then lol;;
<@207416847019016202> How are you brother?;;
Fucked up weekend....and how are you <@416803598173995018>;;
Now I'm intrigued to listen to  <@416803598173995018> voice;;
The man got the sexiest voice on earth <@455797717763883009>  He should be an anchor;;
<@348165887347523594> good man! How you doing today? <@455797717763883009> I have been told it's so nice, that when women listen to it, they immediately get pregnant;;
They get pregnant with triplets;;
So it's like Quiet Place at home then.;;
Doing alright <@416803598173995018>;;
That's why I don't let <@416803598173995018> talk to my wife;;
Or is your wife on the Pills?;;
I don't want to raise some other dude's kids;;
Lol not enough Mango seeds;;
She is, but his voice bypasses it;;
yeah fuck that;;
Is quiet place that Netflix movie <@455797717763883009> ?;;
Yeaah;;
omg.....just read <@488734758847905803> 's comment lmao;;
Wait;;
that's Bird Box;;
Quiet Place is Paramount Pictures;;
Oh wait;;
lol <@455797717763883009> exactly and yeah Im banned from talking to people's wives and girlfriends here;;
Quiet place is with that guy from the office right?;;
lmao;;
My voice overpowers any sort of medication;;
so the pill is but a small barrier that my voice can break through;;
It could cure cancer if pharmaceutical companies didn't want to profit so much;;
My dongle got smaller just listening to <@416803598173995018>;;
Yeah mine went right out my ass;;
Now I'm just smooth;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah John Krasinski;;
Yeah so I watched that;;
Didn't watch the end though;;
Great stuff;;
You need a WTF mango emoji;;
Hahaha;;
<:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840>;;
I got a dongle emoji;;
We should do some movie nights some times people;;
Or movie days lol;;
How does that work?  <@348165887347523594>;;
lmao <@488734758847905803> and <@348165887347523594>;;
This is making my morning so much better;;
Well, we could all connect on the chat, and watch a netflix movie <@455797717763883009>;;
Yeah that could be cool <@348165887347523594>;;
Sounds  cool;;
I'm yet to watch Velvet Buzzsaw;;
Me neither <@455797717763883009>;;
<@488734758847905803> Yeah we should try that;;
Apex exhausted me...I don't even want to play right now;;
Anthem coming out, you gonna play it on the weekend <@348165887347523594> ?;;
Of course <@278571432588345345>;;
I heard they are going to make a prequel to a quiet place so we can see where the creatures came from;;
I'm good, just slept a little at my way home and I'll stream soon  <@348165887347523594>;;
<@416803598173995018> Really?;;

I got you haha;;
Shit, Im still paying off college too!;;
Im gonna be in debt for like 5 more years lol;;
God damn;;
You lucky, unlucky boy;;
lol its all good. Pretty much everyone in America is in debt. Its the American way!;;
Haha, Palm Beach school found my phone number and called me...so I know üòÖ;;
The fuckers, found my cell phone number;;
lol yep. All my friends from college are still paying it off.......almost 10 years later;;
<@416803598173995018> depends on the wedding;;
i can imagine <@361554595354509312> 's wedding;;
- sorry, wedding canceled, dongle crew forever;;
I owe them like 6k for fuck sake;;
<@361554595354509312> as far as American weddings go, we are having a cheap one. Mostly because its not in the country lol. It will be in France;;
It was fun <@207416847019016202>, sorry, I just saw the message now;;
<@348165887347523594> thats not too bad lol. I think my friend owed around 110,000 after school was done;;
Whaatt????;;
yeah its crazy loans;;
I just ckecked. I owe them about 8k;;
it also one of few things that i think way cheaper in russia;;
Yup. Thats not that bad actually, I had other friends that went to very prestigious schools and then went to law school or medical school after and they owe almost $500,000;;
USD to be clear;;
wtf <@416803598173995018>;;
and we i think dont have such thing as student loan;;
How the hell can they actually expect to get this back?;;
I dont know if they ever can honestly. He makes good money as a doctor now but its so hard to get ahead of the payments;;
<@207416847019016202> I still owe a whole lot of money loan...I just can't pay it;;
<@207416847019016202> sry bitch wedding is off kellyd is getting anthem!;;
<@416803598173995018> I make good money too...but it's just impossible to pay this shit back;;
<@348165887347523594> its the interest rates that fuck you;;
Yeah;;
Well...I'm not going to complain....When I almost died...they kind of cancelled it;;
lol well that's good!;;
Can't complain here üòâ;;
You can complain lol it just wont do you any good;;
I complain all the time, doesnt change a thing haha;;

back to work for a bit for me;;
Love you too <:Emote_DONGLE_MASTER_112_00000:543050254157873173>;;
Complaining is good for the soul;;
<@!498246547838992414> Damn right haha;;
And no one will give me my eye back...so kelly will complain the fuck out haha;;
(I almost never complain thought üòÉ );;
If I lost an eye I wouldn't handle it as well as you I think;;
<@416803598173995018> ;;
<@488734758847905803> ;;
<@409836692158021632> ;;

<@!498246547838992414> You would bro;;
<@!498246547838992414> When the shit happens...it happens, and you find the strength to deal with it;;
It would be ok just to add anyone who has ps4/xo. Without planning, just if happens that we're playing the game at the same time;;
If you don't mind me asking, how is it with one eye missing?  <@348165887347523594>;;
My psn is jurpils and my xbox gt is drinkndrivE14;;

<@516763409417764865> No problem bro;;
It's good you learned to live with it, I couldn't imagine it  <@348165887347523594>;;

i read it in order and at some page got lucky;;
<@207416847019016202> I dunno man, 10 days is a long time to catch up. You gonna be able to post at all?;;
i didnt say that ill be away for 10 days;;
i said in 10 days i will go;;
so like 23 feb i meant;;
and of course i will be active;;
just not as usual;;
and your totally wrong about catching up. i joined this discord at least month later than mango, and i catched him up <@416803598173995018>;;
ahh I didnt read that correctly.  lol yeah thats true, you can destroy him this week when he doesnt have much internet;;
My dongle is creeping up on <@348165887347523594>;;
and tickles him on the back;;
and while you point your dongle at kelly, you will be overdongled by <@524820041976250368>;;
That will never happen;;
said mango about me being 1st place;;
Im not Mango though;;
Im better;;
your voice is better;;
and my voice is nicer and I dont get scared like he does;;
nobody get scared like he does;;
lol that clip was so damn funny when he was playing resident evil;;
I sent you a PSN friend request <@516763409417764865>;;
Glad to see you laughing at my fear guys;;
will today be any weak streams? <@409836692158021632> <@416803598173995018>;;
Hahaha;;

Orange joined the discord a few months after, but I didn't used to have mee6 since the beginning;;
maybe not today <@207416847019016202> ;;
I might be working on some banner stuff for Skydaze and changeover üòú;;
Yeah I'm ok <@409836692158021632> , thanks for asking. ;;
It's just some work stuff that got me on an emotional level because I feel like I'm running out of options and my company sucks right now;;
I'm sorry to hear that <@488734758847905803> ;;
if you need anything, you know where to find us;;
I appreciate that a lot. You guys are all amazing. I feel incredibly lucky to have you all in the discord. This is really a community, not just a bunch of randos in a discord;;
haha yeah;;
I'll be fine, I just needed to breathe a little I guess haha;;
sorry <@488734758847905803> I take offense to that;;
my real name is Rando;;
Lmao;;
I had a feeling you'd make a good joke;;
my mom tells me that all the time;;
"but she says it kinda differently...""you're a joke""";;
then my kids all laugh;;
then we have dinner;;
Hahahaha;;
Then your daughter tells you to chill?;;
That was hilarious;;
yes;;
she yells it in my ear all the time;;
üòÇ;;
calm down father;;
no one cares about your videogames;;
no one cares about you;;
i had to say it;;
What‚Äôs up! <@409836692158021632>;;
My dude <@287320205020102667>;;
Seriously, you are the best <@287320205020102667> ;;
Thank you so much for the raid last night!!!;;

I‚Äôm playing apex now though if anyone‚Äôs around;;
Always here for you <@488734758847905803>;;
I'm watching the Apex tournament on Twitch right now...;;
damn the strats and skill levels are ridiculous;;
There‚Äôs a tournament??;;
yup $50K Twitch Rivals;;
all the big streamers;;
"I'll post it in the ""links for any social"" channel";;
Oh damn that‚Äôs awesome. Who‚Äôs doing it?;;
Twitch I think is the sponsor;;
Oh I meant the players. Any big names?;;
Ninja, Dr. Disrespect, Shroud...all the top guys;;
one dude has over 4000 kills with Wraith???!!! ;;
WTF!!!;;
Oh god damn. 4000?! They do play like 10 hours a day every day so I guess it‚Äôs possible. They‚Äôre all so good at video games lol;;
yeah they play everyday but the skill factor too;;
that's just insane;;
and I'm seeing some insane strategies;;
it's like they're playing an entirely different game;;
lol yeah that‚Äôs what you get when you‚Äôre a pro gamer. Can only dream of that;;
yeah man;;
watching this makes me wanna play more and at the same time cry with how good they are;;
üò¢;;
lol seriously. I wish I was half that good;;
I‚Äôm back on playing titanfall 2 now lol. Got the urge for it;;
haha noice!;;
Can‚Äôt find a game though lol. I had no problem the other day but not today;;
Just as I wrote that I got one lol;;
üòÇ;;
I‚Äôm so used to apex that I‚Äôm all fucked up with this lol;;
haha stop playing! don't let your Apex skills deteriorate!;;
lol but I forgot how much titanfall is!;;
true...I wanna play it again too not gonna lie;;
The titans are so cool. I love how fast paced it is. I played this game sooo much when it came out;;
Wall running is the best;;
Ok back to apex now lol;;
yes!;;
This sucks playing with randoms lol.;;
just leave em and pretend you're playing solos;;
lol there would be some salty people. Last game I grabbed a gun my teammate was going to, he already had one and I didn‚Äôt and he turned his mic on and cussed me out for ‚Äústealing his gun‚Äù lol I just left;;
haha;;
so toxic...like Purple Mango;;
Lmao dont you mean orange? Lol;;
Orange is a beacon of light and positivity...;;
wachu talkin' bout, Willis?;;
üòÇ;;
Hahahahaha ohhh ok;;
you need Orange on your team;;
dude is straight up esports ready;;
Seriously. Wish I had a pc;;
It‚Äôs just me and one other team. My teammates died and left. This is intense lol;;
Oh damnit I died!;;
Fuck I can‚Äôt believe I got that far on my own lol;;
I wish I was streaming that lol;;
<@409836692158021632> you gonna play tonight at all?;;
Maybe not tonight <@416803598173995018> üò≠;;
Aww too bad. I‚Äôm on now. Fianc√© went to bed early cause she didn‚Äôt feel good. Just gonna game for awhile;;
I‚Äôm up to 27 kills now lol;;
Noice! You main Bangalore?;;
Wraith. The apex legends addiction is real lol. I just got 4 second places in a row. Talk about frustrating lol;;
üòÇ  Apex Anonymous here we come!!!;;
You'll get that win tho, no doubt and then some!;;
Omg you are so mean  <@409836692158021632> with your jokes.  Esports ready üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;
Ready to die you mean?;;
Orange plays at a top tier high level;;
His only competition is in esports ;;
Did you not see your own Apex clips, <@207416847019016202> ???;;
Apex clips are awesome, but they are yours  <@409836692158021632>;;
By the way, I checked, my legend has only one kill;;
Second clip;;
So first wasn't me!!!;;
Singdeath got him;;
Did you check your finishers?;;
The first kill was all you!!! Singdeath was just there for emotional support! üòÇ;;
He was helping emotionally and with shooting;;
Well I can say for sure that fibisher doesn't guarantee kill;;
I finished someone before, but kill went to guy who actually shot that person;;
Bug;;
Every bullet from Orange is a finisher;;
Add it to Orange bible üíÖ;;
When Orange checks his menu, it's a finisher;;
Yeah I got game crashed yesterday during stream. Apparently it was too much menu clicking;;
When Orange shoots an alien in Dead Space, a legend dies in Apex.;;
And that legend dies by a finisher.;;
When <@207416847019016202> drinks coffee, it's a finisher;;
You right, and nobody dies in dead space when Orange shoots;;
When <@207416847019016202> types in discord, it's a finisher;;
When Orange eats, one mango dies;;
üòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
When <@207416847019016202> uses the toilet, it's a finisher...;;
And a mango dies also...;;
By a finisher...;;
Well, it seems there is a lot of dying mangos involved;;
Mango genocide;;
<@207416847019016202> ;;
is a Mass Mango Murderer;;
<@207416847019016202> ;;
Is a Serial Mangorer;;
Mangorer sounds as if I love mangos  <@409836692158021632>;;
Hahaha...you're right;;
Sorry;;
Mango genocide is good idea for t shirt too;;
Prevent mango genocide! If you're mango, just kill yourself first;;
üëÄ;;
Kind Morning Orange;;
But Mango cant be killed;;
He rises up like a pheonix;;
He's a pheonix mango...but purple;;
In Russian we have this saying (I'm not sure if english has it) - shit doesn't drown in water;;
Or something like this;;
Hmmm interesting;;
It basically means that bad things are immortal;;
Good job <@!207416847019016202>, your dongle just grew to 28!;;
As always nice time to grow;;
28???;;
Your dongle is on steroids, comrade!;;
It's not steroid, it's Russian meal;;
Russian meal = aka dead mangoes;;
Stop eating dead mangos you Mangorer! üòÇ;;
Okay, I will switch to weak Americans diet;;
I meant eating them;;
Hahaha;;
American diet isn't weak, have you ever seen the Olympics?;;

Do you still have less work due to chinas new year?;;
yes less work. But busy with my toher job as well later tonight. I also work as a community developer and mentor.;;
what does community developer do? <@345380744375566338>;;
Morning Mangoes and Oranges üêº;;
and Pandas;;
A number of things. We have several projects in the works. One thing is providing jobs for Arabic refugees by helping them develop business plan for opening a restaurant. Another way is providing a community center to feel connected with others from their same situation. Another is helping with free tutoring in German. I want to develop some free strength training programs and open a gym for them. Different. Also help with government matters, visa, paper work, etc.;;
<@207416847019016202>;;
There is only one Panda üêº;;
morning to that one panda <@455797717763883009>;;
Hahah how's work going on?;;
do you ask me or <@345380744375566338> ?;;

barabbas i guess too;;
Haha both of you;;
<@345380744375566338> doing some good work out there üëç;;
Well I start my teaching job in half hour. Has been slow because all of my English students are in China, and they have Chinese new year. I teach from home;;
<@207416847019016202> I voted for Atom. I love me some Isometric;;
yeah i agree, good game;;
<@348165887347523594> loves it more than subnautica or me playing dead space;;
absii wants you to join his stream;;
he is playing metro and wants you to read the russian signs;;
Hey, what's up <@207416847019016202> , been up watching <@160543395037708288> 's stream all night long. He just asked for you;;
Ho shit, I'm starting to get really sleepy lol <@345380744375566338> ....I didn't even notice you just said it lol;;
go sleep;;
was it you who voted for atom too? <@348165887347523594>;;
That was me  <@207416847019016202>;;
voting channel <@348165887347523594>;;
i know how it will be, same as last time.. one vote, second vote... and then 10 votes for most popular game, like apex;;
Done <@207416847019016202>;;
thanks <@348165887347523594>;;
No problem üòâ;;
I like chill games because then we can chat;;
thats why I like to play Pillars at night;;
i agree, isometric rpg is good chilly game;;
i miss atom to be honest;;
since i didnt stream it 2 weeks i think;;
but yesterday apex session was fun too;;
especially that moment in apex when <@348165887347523594> said for 24th time that he hates me playing dead space;;
okay, its one vote for apex already...;;
chose all games <@87241615671832576>;;
hey;;
And Hello everyone;;
Morning  <@87241615671832576> üòÑ;;
Indies and Mid tier for me;;
i love all tiers of game, but problem for me is that MOST of indies is not something i like, like point and click, but platformers and rogue like and stuff;;
I do wonder how big the market are for mid tier and indies as a streaming thing. At times it mostly are revolving about how different the experiences can be.;;
I get that one <@207416847019016202>.;;
I am mostly curious of what exactly I want to stream as I am all over the spectre regarding Interest;;
So if there was a clear cut niche it would be easier.;;
Ho boy, I'm think that I'm gonna go to sleep in a little bit;;
im pretty sure its not so much about the game <@87241615671832576> ;;
<@348165887347523594> watched me ATOM, which he would never play;;
Sleep well Kelly;;
Sleep what's that;;
haha;;
Metro 2033 is finally done... <@160543395037708288>  has done it in one stream;;
Yeah I k ow what you mean. To me it's more about highlighting really interesting games to as many as possible though :);;
How long did it take;;
?;;
So he started at 20:00 and finished at 6:20;;
thats crazy....;;
do you have some specifig games to chose from right now? <@87241615671832576>;;
That is almost 10 hours straight;;
Yeahh that's a tough one.;;
Not really <@207416847019016202>, I am currently just looking into what games to buy the next couple of months and maybe to contact developers in some way. Just to see where it'll lead.;;
hoooo my god;;
so tired ahah;;
<@348165887347523594> go to bed;;
<@345380744375566338> thanks for joining in for that last stretch, and <@207416847019016202> for translating 0 signs that showed up after you showed up hahahaha;;
for some reason no more signs;;
I hope you had fun <@160543395037708288> ;);
im dead;;
literally;;
<@87241615671832576> hows your pc?;;
I am currently in the process of reinstalling from scratch, as it was acting up.;;
Good job <@!87241615671832576>, your dongle just grew to 10!;;
No, I want a small dongle;;
You re wrong, there was ONE sing when you watched youtube haha  <@160543395037708288>;;
There's an operation for that;;
Might be;;
<@159985870458322944> give me a small dongle;;
Yeah <@488734758847905803> can do such operation;;
hahaha GAS;;
Yep üòÇ;;
So it turned out I was useful;;
Sounds like fun;;
Nintendo Direct happening today;;
have your eye out for anything or just like to see whats up;;
Just to see what's up;;
Have a backlog on the Switch. And it's only been 2 months since I got it;;
I'd totally want a switch;;
It's damn good;;
Battery life could be better;;
But that's okay, it's like a reminder to take a break from looking into the screen;;
not a fan of that battery as well;;
I heard about the battery, but again as you said. It keeps you from sitting 12 hours straight and playing.;;
Exactly. I remember when I was playing Spider-Man and skipped lunch, only to find out that the sun has set;;
haha <@455797717763883009>;;
Sounds like something I'd do aswell as an accident;;
It's always an accident;;
Lol;;
Accident.....rightü§î;;
Morning everyone! I hope you all have a wonderful day!;;
heeey <@524820041976250368>;;
thanks for joining my stream yesterday;;
sorry i wasnt too interactive with chat;;
Heyy, how‚Äôre you? And I‚Äôm glad I could stop by your stream! And don‚Äôt apologize when people play apex it‚Äôs hard to focus on chat <@207416847019016202>;;
!kelly sleep;;
hello all...I can't  believe it's only 8:38 and I'm already up after that night watching that stream;;
lol;;
Morning  <@524820041976250368>;;
you slept 2 hours or something like that <@348165887347523594>;;
This isn't good enough;;
yeah;;
go sleep more;;
Morning  <@348165887347523594> <@524820041976250368>;;
Will try....I've been dreaming about Athem and the time I should start downloading;;
haha;;
Hope you guys are fine <@343707181377388544>  and <@524820041976250368>;;
and dreamed today that i put in my poll Fallout 76 and it won, and i needed to play it on stream;;
really? lmao;;
Fallout 76 is the best game ever made;;
Why are there a bunch of insomniacs in this discord;;
If you guys had children you would appreciate sleep more;;
üòÜ;;
Heyy, how‚Äôre you? And I‚Äôm glad I could stop by your stream! And don‚Äôt apologize when people play apex it‚Äôs hard to focus on chat <@207416847019016202>;;
I have no idea, I've heard only bad things about Fallout 76 <@!498246547838992414>;;
It's horrible lmao <@348165887347523594>;;
Can't have kids so game on  <@345380744375566338>;;
<@345380744375566338> I'm sure we would lol;;
kelly: *why have kids when you have Anthem*;;
right? lol;;
Morning <@348165887347523594> <@455797717763883009> <@343707181377388544>;;
Morning <@524820041976250368> , I'm trying to understand why I'm up;;
Sorry I haven‚Äôt been super active not been feeling too well but going to the dr in a bit. And you should get some more sleep! <@348165887347523594> I finally passed out early for once and just woke up not long ago lol;;
Yea I think sleep would help. <@524820041976250368> sorry you are feeling bad. Take care and sleep.üòÅ;;
Good to know you could get some sleep <@524820041976250368> . We all need some time off social media sometimes.  And that last weekend was weird for many of us for some reason.;;
I hope you'll feel better soon;;
Aww thank you! <@345380744375566338> <@348165887347523594> I‚Äôve just been feeling like my body has been trying to have a heart attack since 3am yesterday morning. But symptoms have finally subsided I mean im still in some pain but not like it was.;;
<@524820041976250368> could be  as simple as a pinched nerve in your neck all to way to more serious medical issues;;
Yeah I know, see I was laughing super hard to where I couldn‚Äôt breathe lol yesterday morning around 2am and ever since then my chest and left arm have been in severe pain, I also almost fainted after laughing so hard, my heart literally felt like it was about to burst out of my chest <@343707181377388544>;;
hey <@!498246547838992414>;;
"Damn <@524820041976250368> what ever has made you laugh this hard must've been ""painfully hilarious""";;
Umm haha me and my cousins gf was talking about how my dongle grew yesterday to level 14üòÇ It wasn‚Äôt exactly funny I guess but hell I was sleep deprived so it was very much hilarious <@348165887347523594>;;
Hoo lol, dongle talk can always turn out to be hilarious when the timing is perfect;;
fuck i just laughed in office readin how some dudes gf discussed nerdys dongle <@524820041976250368>;;
üòÇ;;
Yeah exactly! <@348165887347523594> and lmfao <@207416847019016202>;;
I told my cousin I was gonna slap him with my dongle cause he was being an ass üòÇ talking about dongles seems to piss him off but o gotta admit it is quite hilarious pissing him off;;
haha;;
reading some apex tips....;;
;;
The last person to get to pick a legend will always be assigned jumpmaster;;
If this person doesn't pick anything before the timer runs out jumpmaster will be given to the next player;;
Morning mangos!;;
Damn I miss so much when I‚Äôm sleeping lol. 212 messages since my last one;;
Morning mango!;;
Haha damn;;
I do too;;
Well, we ended up not going to my in-laws' house yesterday cause a big job appeared for Carina. So, we're going tonight. I don't know if it'll be late enough to stream though, unless I stream earlier. If not, it'll just be book writing time haha;;
Only 212? <@416803598173995018> ;;
im in bad shape;;
Yeah you gotta do better. Ahh that‚Äôs cool for carina!;;
guys ill appreciate if youll go to <#545152120186208257>  channel and vote for my today's stream game;;
is Carina, like, valid brasil name?;;
because we got that name too;;
not much though;;
Morning  <@488734758847905803>;;
<@207416847019016202> how many days do you think would be enough to visit Moscow?;;
Hey <@455797717763883009> !;;
Yeah <@207416847019016202> , I think it's originally an Italian name? But I'm not sure;;
i think too <@488734758847905803>;;
It's cool that it's an international name;;
Yo mango. How's it going?;;
Doing pretty well now. Hbu panda?;;
Doing good too;;
It's finally 12¬∞ here;;
Nice and sunny;;
Haha nice;;
Today it got a bit cold here haha;;
Cold like 24¬∞?;;
i dont care much about tourist stuff, that would require you to check out this and that and spend no less than n days and such. so i would go from how long for you is okay to spend in a city. for example, i would prefer 7-10, just walking around city every day. but me and my gf are really love to walk, so it may be not for you. and if you have enough days, you could check out st petersburg too, but i would strongly suggest st petersburg not earlier that may or june <@455797717763883009>;;
no, it was 22 and bums were dying from cold <@455797717763883009>;;
Ahaha;;
For me not more than 5 days in a city;;
I love walking too;;
But mostly interested in architecture and food;;
Hmm, maybe for a long weekend in July;;
I saw tickets for 100‚Ç¨ in April;;
I voted <@207416847019016202>;;
I love traveling. Could spends weeks in certain cities. So much to see, especially in Europe;;
july is one of the best options, because its warm haha <@455797717763883009>;;
I voted too <@207416847019016202>;;
thanks guys;;
I voted for dead space;;
True <@416803598173995018>;;
i saw yeah;;
but for now atom is winning;;
but its tight competition;;
Oh damn;;
Haha;;
Haha July it is then!  <@207416847019016202>;;
Yeah I voted for dead space also. It‚Äôs funny to see Kelly get so mad when orange plays lol;;
yeah;;
and i failed only in 1 chapter of 6;;
Hahha;;
I had a crazy game of apex last night mango. My teammates died early on so I kept going by myself. Made it to the me and one other team, I had 5 kills but then they ended killing me. I got one of them though lol. Was so intense haha;;
Nice!;;
You're a beast at that game;;
I'm.playing a little bit now so I can not suck so bad when we play;;
But I feel that every time I encounter enemies they surround me and kill.me;;
*die die die die die die die die*;;
Lmao;;
I hate players that jump early;;
Jesus;;
lol;;
They always get us killed;;
TRUE;;
I wasn't mad <@416803598173995018> lol...it was just that one game. And I promise I won't say anything again <@207416847019016202> . It's just that he stayed so long in that one spot of the game I felt overwhelmed for him;;
I wanted to help, but couldn't do anything;;
Haha I know  <@348165887347523594>;;
You can say whatever you want;;
lol;;
Especially when I can't hear you;;
hahahaha;;
Yeah right ?;;
Origin says Windows preload date February 13th at 2pm bot for anthem. Is bot a time zone?;;
Never heard of It, but I suck at timezones;;
And dead space (c) Kelly;;
Yeah, I've noticed lol;;
Well actually I don't suck at timezones. I remember most of timezones here, but I remember cities/countries/states, not abbreviations;;
Looking forward to when you will be in moscow dude  <@455797717763883009>;;
And I hope someone else will go too;;
Apparently it's Bolivia time zone;;
And it seems that I'm the same time zone too;;
So it's in 4-4 hours for You?;;
Will definitely come for a weekend  <@207416847019016202>;;
Moscow and it's architecture has always intrigued me;;
Need to figure out the visa process;;
yeah, but it doesn't mean much, even if I start downloading it it at 14 o'clock today, I'm probably not going to be finished on release date. 50 gigs to download and, I don't think I'm going to use my 4g setup. The data plan is too tight;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 22!;;
Apparently I'm from a 'migration risk' country lol;;
<@455797717763883009> Remind me where you are;;
<@488734758847905803> lol yeah Im getting better, its a really fun game. <@348165887347523594> maybe mad wasnt the right word lol. Frustrated watching orange? haha either way it was funny;;
In Italy KellyD. But I'm from India;;
<@416803598173995018> Yeah, frustrated is the right word lol;;
And hence the migration risk;;
God damnit Kelly! Whyd you have to grow your dongle again?;;
Im trying to catch up!!;;
<@416803598173995018> I didn't even try lol...I thought you would after the lack of activity these past days;;
Dear Russia. I've already migrated. No more risk xD;;
<@455797717763883009> lol I understand;;
Now how long is my dongle ü§î;;
I'm getting there!;;
Yep, at a good paste you are;;
<:Emote_TOP_DONGLE_112_00000:543050254426308651>;;
So do you mean that you need a visa to travel from Italia to Russia, and the fact that you came from India is giving you a hard time to get it <@455797717763883009> ?;;
Yeah, I would need a travel visa to visit Russia. It's easier for most European countries and the USA;;
But you are naturalized in Italia right?;;
But since I have an Indian Passport, it's on the migration risk list. So I need to go to the consulate here and provide documents and apply.;;
Otherwise it can be done online;;
Ho ok ok got you;;
Shouldn't be a big deal. But need to figure out what exact documents they require;;
Last time I went to Japan. They asked for a 3000‚Ç¨ balance in my account xD;;
Yeah, when I hear travel visa, it usually makes me tired on the spot;;
Yeah sometimes it's a chore. Especially taking off from work to go 2-3 to get the application done;;
Good job <@!455797717763883009>, your dongle just grew to 9!;;
<:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840>;;
But I've haven't visited a country which required me to have one yet. I usually travel to the U.S.A when I do, or European countries when I'm motivated.;;
Damn, your dongle just got a boost again;;
Wait... someone can be afraid if you're will move to Russia?  <@455797717763883009>;;
<@348165887347523594> Im trying lol. I don have a ton of time to talk though so its tough. Depends on how the work day goes;;
The Russian government is afraid  <@207416847019016202> to be exact;;
<@348165887347523594> you're from?;;
Yeah, I feel that even <@488734758847905803> has taken some time off discord lately with all the stuff he has to take care of .;;
I'm from Martinique <@455797717763883009>  with a French passport;;
You can say to Russian embassy that Orange is not afraid  <@455797717763883009>;;
lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
Lol  <@207416847019016202> maybe I just call you and give the phone to them?;;
Oh nice  <@348165887347523594>;;
Exactly, European passport has better prospect;;
"And I will say ""don't believe that sneaky Indian ""  <@455797717763883009>";;
In Russian;;
So I won't understand;;
So we get a pretty large amount of destinations we can travel too without a travel visa. It's not bad. <@455797717763883009> And yep, I just hope France doesn't gets out of the Euro zone anytime soon.;;
TRUE;;
Lots of politics tending to push for an exit and it scares me a bit;;
We will know once the Brexit shit storm goes through;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnhGHsrlFS0;;
Yeah exactly <@455797717763883009>;;
Damn, he has already done his review. The  man doesn't stop working;;
Yeah;;
Gonna watch it right after my coffee break;;
Yeah I have. But things will be back to normal soon;;
Karak doesn't sleep;;
He's worse than orange;;
His batteries are larger;;
yep lol;;
Take your time <@488734758847905803> , we all have our real lives to deal with;;
Yeah. On Monday things will be back to normal. I'll be home and I'll be done with work stuff;;
This week has been off for me too. It's kinda funny how people tend to have similar weeks even though we are all different and in different places of the world;;
Haha yeah it's like there's an energy;;
That FUCKS UP OUR SCHEDULES;;
<@416803598173995018> This is what I've been thinking;;
Yeah schedules are all fucked for me this week. <@348165887347523594> yeah like mango sid, its like an energy;;
I bet it's <@207416847019016202> 's fault;;
He wanted to be  #1;;
yeah, it's all his fault;;
Orange Vortex;;
haha;;
I just notice <@502171199850414081> was online this morning. Damn I missed it. Even though I didn't really get to sleep like I should've .;;
<@488734758847905803> lol Orange is the catalyst. <@348165887347523594> Yeah I checked in for a bit to watch her stream. She goes on an hour before I get up so its tough, I feel bad I am not able to watch her streams more and interact;;
Yeah, I feel you. I'm not sure which time zone she is on;;
Ive set up notifications for all the people here when they go live so  I can try and watch as many streams as I can;;
Shes in France;;
not sure exact time zone;;
<@207416847019016202> you should voice a character in the next METRO game;;
So she is like 11 hours ahead of you <@416803598173995018>;;
No more like 10 hours;;
metro - aka a day in <@207416847019016202>'s life;;
lol <@278571432588345345>;;
<@348165887347523594> yeah so its tough for me to watch a few people here. Stupid time zones;;
<@455797717763883009> thats a great idea for Orange lol;;
Yeah, 6 hours is alright, but 10 is really tough;;
Haha, with the character wearing the iconic orange beanie <@416803598173995018>;;
Ive said it before but I will say it again, lets all just move to the same area lol;;
<@455797717763883009> lol! That would be amazing;;
Hahh;;
Anyone rich enough to buy an island?;;
Let's all move in with Orange;;
too cold and Russian;;
Too russian and cold;;
<@455797717763883009> maybe a small one? lol;;
not small Russian I mean, a small island lol;;
lol;;
*Invade an island*;;
The American way!;;
Hell yeah;;
or British I suppose lol;;
or German, the list can go on and on;;
Meh, both;;
lol exactly;;
So... What island are we taking bois?;;
The one <@348165887347523594>  is on;;
Yeah it seems nice but the internet there might be an issue so we will have to take over an internet provider as well to get a better one;;
LMAO <@278571432588345345>;;
Haha Singapore?;;
might be too big;;
Hahahah;;
Let's just take all of america;;
I really want to go to California;;
My wife does too;;
She can get some mad work;;
And I can be an Uber;;
And wannabe streamer;;
Uber Mango;;
Imagine that?;;
You guys would get in a car with me;;
I'd stream my Uber rides;;
Without showing their faces;;
And talk games;;
Strictly gamer-only uber;;
Yeah;;
With RGB seats;;
That'd be cool;;
<@488734758847905803> oh it‚Äôs ok mango, you didn‚Äôt mention hang out with me but it‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt wanna hang out with you anyways;;
ooooof;;
Or marklar either. I see where your allegiances lie;;
Hahaha I didn't even get to that yet;;
I'd get to meet two awesome dongles;;
I mean guys;;
there is only 2 cities in the world that i would agree to live in. Moscow and New York. So you can choose guys;;
Why not la? <@207416847019016202>;;
New York sucks;;
ask <@416803598173995018>;;
lol it‚Äôs ok mango. I can‚Äôt stay mad at you for long;;
i dont want to live in city with bad transoprt city and low buildings;;
Ahh true but New York is awful;;
my ideal of city is huge city;;
New York is kinda awful;;
I mean;;
It's cool for a few days;;
all of russia thinks moscow is awful <@416803598173995018>;;
The best city in the world is obviously Brussels *nervous laughter*;;
so i totally get it;;
Hahaha;;
Boston is better. Not just saying that cause Boston and New York are rival cities lol;;
Damn <@498246547838992414>;;
and i know that its kinda city i want to live in;;
What is there to do in Boston <@416803598173995018> ?;;
My wife and I thought it kinda looked like a regular city;;
New York is gross, compacted living, awful traffic and crazy expensive to live in;;
all russia hate moscow because, you know, its too loud, too crazy, to many people, more expensive... but i love it;;
Lots of history there if you‚Äôre visiting. Tons of museums and walking tours;;
and also moscow have terrible traffic;;
but why should i care when heres perfect metro system;;
<@207416847019016202>  It's never too many people for someone from India Lol;;
Lol <@455797717763883009>;;
Great bars in Boston and great food. Sports games, cool architecture;;
<@416803598173995018>  you in NY?;;
yeah, i love when city is crowded <@455797717763883009>;;
He's in LA;;
Damn, I'm feeling too lazy to read all these messages;;
go sleep;;
Hell no! <@455797717763883009> lol I‚Äôm originally from Boston but live in LA now;;
From what I've learned, Moscow is basically Brussels, but bigger, more snow and less assholes;;
Haha nice;;
Lol Brussels is nice;;
been there twice;;
Meh, it's alright;;
What's the rest of the poem <@455797717763883009> ?;;
Lol;;
less assholes? dont know, moscow got me <@!498246547838992414>;;
Haha nice;;
Lol Brussels is nice;;
been there twice;;
On my watch there's straight ice;;
<@207416847019016202> I can't man, I've got all the sleep I could get today;;
<@207416847019016202> we are different in that regard. I hate when cities are too crowded. A lot of LA is like that. It‚Äôs a problem here though because there are so many homeless everywhere also;;
I really really like gambling so roll the dice;;
Me always in vegas on the slot machine device;;
then we headin' to domino's for a pizza slice;;
<@416803598173995018> It is true that New York is crazy expensive;;
But my lass is vegan, Imma pick up some rice;;
This is shit;;
Just have a mango slice;;
*mic drop*;;
lol;;
<@416803598173995018> my fianc√© had friends that lived there. They lived in the bad part of the Bronx. There was 4 of them that shared a 2 bedroom tiny apartment and it was almost $3500 USD a month. I think there and San Fransisco are the 2 most expensive places to live in USA;;
<@416803598173995018>  just talking to the mirror lol;;
You just spoke to yourself <@416803598173995018> lol;;
Whoops lol;;
lmao;;
3500$ ???;;
I meant <@348165887347523594>;;
well i get you totally, but i kinda offended that everyonve so smart and starts to tell me educated opinions how new york totally sucks, when i live in moscow and 100% know what im talking about <@416803598173995018>;;
Thats how much i pay for half a year;;
Ok cool, I figured you were lol <@416803598173995018>;;
Don‚Äôt judge me! I can talk to myself if I want lol;;
And i thought Milan was expensive. lol;;
<@207416847019016202> it‚Äôs just my opinion. I‚Äôve been there several times, I just really don‚Äôt like that city.;;
And yes $3500 usd a month <@455797717763883009> lol;;
<@416803598173995018> I know I wouldn't be able to afford it in New York...I'm too laid back for that;;
its not just opinion, i undestand that for you new york is better <@416803598173995018>;;
oops;;
i meant LA;;
lol;;
Everyone is different though. I have friends that hate la and like to live far out in the country. I don‚Äôt live in la, just close by. We live in a smaller city about 20 minutes from la and it‚Äôs perfect for us. Everyone has their likes and dislikes.;;
IMO stay where you find it to be comfortable and travel everywhere <@207416847019016202>;;
Exactly <@455797717763883009>;;
i said something against? <@455797717763883009>;;
youre saying it as if i dont agree;;
Haha, i wasn't countering you. Just adding to your opinion;;
oh ok;;
My grandmother lived in Brooklyn for the major part of her life in Flatbush avenue. Not really a place that I'm missing . <@416803598173995018>;;
I did that last year, spent all I had and travelled to 16 countries from Jan '18 to Dec '18;;
Best decision ever.;;
Now I'm broke lol;;
<@455797717763883009> Nice though;;
I really wanna visit NY, especially after playing Spider-Man;;
You better have some nice savings <@455797717763883009> lol;;
Surprisingly the flights are cheap <@348165887347523594>;;
<@348165887347523594> yeah it‚Äôs just personal preference really. That‚Äôs awesome <@455797717763883009> totally worth it;;
I think you have to visit N.Y.  it is a cool city, just not for me;;
<@455797717763883009> , you mean the flights when you were visiting all these countries, or the one to NY?;;
The one to NY;;
400‚Ç¨ roundtrip;;
<@416803598173995018>  yeah it was! Gonna take it slow this year. Make some savings and repeat it in 2020;;
<@455797717763883009> very cool, I want to travel alot;;
I would love to do the same too;;
okay, lets check out what game orange is playing in 20 minutes;;
is it me or discord is going crazy?;;
Going crazy how?;;
Well most my messages would not go through for the past 5 minutes;;
Yeah, messages aren't going through;;
Finally;;
yeah;;
now its ok i think;;
ATOM RPG;;
It was for you too ? I restarted my  internet and all thinking it was maybe on my side;;
it was discord;;
i tried to say it to you <@348165887347523594>;;
but discord didnt let me;;
Ok same thing here;;
it was discord;;
"you cant say ""it was discord"" when youre on discord";;
lol;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1EqciwkyJU;;
ohh ok <@348165887347523594> I wasnt having any issues;;
<@!498246547838992414> is live right now;;
Atom won? <@207416847019016202>;;
<@416803598173995018> How can you know if you weren't speaking haha;;
yes <@416803598173995018>;;
Ho yeah you did answer to me though;;
you mean god answered your prayers and its ATOM time? <@348165887347523594>;;
Yeaheeeeyeaahhhhh!!;;
Atom has won by far though;;
Shut up! <@348165887347523594> lol nice <@207416847019016202> when are you going live?;;
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW <@416803598173995018>;;
let me do announcements and im ready to go;;
hhhmmm both <@502171199850414081> and <@!498246547838992414> are live. This is conflicting. I'll try to hope on theirs while you are still preparing.;;
take your time, watch them <@348165887347523594>;;
you can do a multistream and have multiple streams watching at the same time;;
https://multistre.am/;;
Ho, I'll try that <@416803598173995018> , if my internet lets me... Twitch server doesn't like my location apparently;;
I still have 40gigs on each my 4g subscriptions...I'm still wondering if I should use it to download Anthem, and deal with my adsl line for the rest of the month;;
tough decision;;
Got 1 month EA Access on xbox to try Anthem;;
10 hour trial from 15th January;;
Damn <@455797717763883009> , my wife and I traveled for 8 months;;
In 2016;;
From May to January 17;;
<@455797717763883009> , ea access gives you anthem?!;;
<@488734758847905803> 10 hours;;
Yeah! just a 10 hour trial;;
It's not bad;;
Ah damn;;
But still, its better than nothing;;
I won't be at home on Friday;;
4‚Ç¨ a month, the vault has Unravel 2 also;;
It is better than nothing;;
And a nice discount too I think doesn't it <@455797717763883009> ?;;
I actually got it for 2‚Ç¨, had 2‚Ç¨ credit on microsoft;;
yeah a 10% discount;;
if you buy the game, and progress carries over;;
I'd buy the physical version, so i can trade-in <@348165887347523594>;;
Ok, I'm still wondering if I'm going to get it on xbox or ps4...if there is an overwhelming amount of friends playing it on either platform, I may;;
And I will need to see if it will still crashes on my computer like it was while the demo...Cause by the end of it, it was almost impossible to finish a game;;
Too*;;
Yeah <@348165887347523594> I'm.wondering tol;;
<@416803598173995018> , are you getting anthem?;;
<@488734758847905803>  it's starting from Feb 15th;;
you can try for 10 hours any day;;
10 hours is a good start...and it's on any platform <@455797717763883009> right?;;
No, just Xbox;;
EA Access is only on xbox;;
But there's Origin for PC;;
Yeah, well <@488734758847905803> can get the trial on xbox than...He doesn't have to right pc yet <@455797717763883009>;;
With Origin Premier you get the full game;;
its 15$ a month;;
And Origin Basic for 4$ a month and 10 hours of playtime;;
Yeah I was just looking to prepare myself financially to get a PC, and the cost came to almost 2000$;;
I can't afford another pc now. It's just not worth the price. Here the pc I wanted would cost me close to 3000 euros. I'm still good with my actual setup though;;
With the prices of pc part now, I may come back to more console gaming if my pc ever shows signs of weakness. Actually I have not experience so many crashes for a long time before Anthem's demo. I just hope the build will be fixed and those new nvidia drivers will handle the game correctly.;;
It crashed so many times that it corrupted my hd and I had to restore an acronis system image;;
Which card you got?;;
I have two gtx 980 strix, but sli didn't not work with Anthem. I had to disable it;;
damn;;
I got the second card not long ago. It was a bargain. The guy was selling it it for 100 euros. Since he came all the way down to my town, I gave him 140 for it.;;
Haha how kind of you;;
He was initially selling the card for 150 to a friend of mine. Then, my friend got him to lower even more the price the day of the transaction. My mind was already set for 150 if you see what I mean;;
And I felt bad he had to drive almost an hour to get to me considering the price he was selling it for;;
Ah like that. Still a good deal;;
Yeah, verry good deal, it's a good gpu .;;
I cant wait to build a PC. Probably wont be until next year at this point though;;
Thanks for stopping by guys!!!;;
The overall price isn't that expensive if you don't count the gpu...But once you add the gpu it gets crazy;;
How much is a good gpu to play games and stream?;;
Down here, it's around 600 euros;;
And not the best one;;
Damn, yeah Im gonna just work on my PS4 set up first. If streaming takes off more for me, then I will build a pc;;
I still would love to get a 1080 ti, but it's still over 1000;;
<@416803598173995018> yeah, honestly I do not want to invest more money on my pc...Even if I could, I don't think I would. I do not agree with the prices . They are ridiculous;;
wow thats expensive. Yeah for right now I will just get a capture card and cam after June;;
Maybe you can find better deals in the u.s;;
Probably but it will still cost me bout $1200ish USD to build a decent pc. I figured I can spend around $500 USD on a PS4 setup and go from there;;
I totally agree honestly;;
These past times, I'm not sure if I'm in favor of promoting investing to anyone on an expensive pc. especially now that consoles are back in the game. It's been a wonderful gaming year so far .;;
Yeah, I cant justify a PC right now. First because I would terrible with it lol. I have been playing consoles most of my life so it would be a tough adjustment and second, the price. If I can get bigger with a good PS4 setup, then I will buy a good PC;;
<@416803598173995018> Well thought. I'm slowly going to focus on my consoles than pc until prices lower down a bit.;;
Yeah thats a good plan;;
"When origin says ""preload now"" it really only means ""start downloading"" right?";;
lol no clue, sorry;;
haha;;
Hope you all are having a fantastic day!;;
So far so good <@524820041976250368> , hope yours is going well too üòâ;;
Thank you! It‚Äôs going good, dr wanted to admit me to the hospital for a 24 hour watch to make sure nothings wrong but I said no. So I gotta go back to the dr tomorrow <@348165887347523594>;;
does anyone know if theres a way to have google chrome warn you before closing multiple tabs? I just closed my browser by accident and cant remember what I had open, im annoyed lol;;
<@524820041976250368> Ho ok, I hope you do feel better though and make sure you visit the Dr tomorrow;;
I will, i may let them admit me tomorrow if I‚Äôm still having the pain I just hate hospitals and everyone‚Äôs jumping my ass cause as they say I‚Äôm playing with my health but it‚Äôs all good I‚Äôll be okay <@348165887347523594>;;
Go to history <@416803598173995018> than recently closed;;
<@524820041976250368> I understand, I hate hospital myself... I don't even go when I should go visit someone (which is not being a good friend but I hate it there);;
Awesome! Thanks so much <@348165887347523594>;;
You're welcome <@416803598173995018>;;
Yeah I know but being stuck in there for 24 hours is just too much for me cause if something is wrong they will keep me longer and well that‚Äôs just not happening lol <@348165887347523594>;;
How‚Äôre you? <@416803598173995018>;;

Exactly origin basic;;
Good job <@!455797717763883009>, your dongle just grew to 10!;;
Wohoo 10 <:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840>;;
Comes with the Vault games;;
shame it's not crossplay;;
Yeah;;
Let's see how it performs;;
Looks like all releases this week are doing well;;
Metro and Crackdown;;
yeah Crackdown IS crossplay though;;
so I'm gonna play that on xbox;;
love my xbox one x;;
Yeah will install it too;;
Gamepass for the year sorted;;
I remember like a year ago I was to that point that I hated my xbox...Now I'm all over it again...it's crazy how the gaming industry got back into the right path between 2017 and 2019;;
True that  <@348165887347523594>;;
Around the time when Forza Horizon 3 released. That's when I got my first Xbox One S;;
I got mine when it first came out. I was just talking to <@488734758847905803> about the fact that I'm probably not going to get one of the latest version cause it will be tough to sell. But if there are sales when cyberpunk comes out...maybe I'll reconsider it;;
There'll definitely be a CP77 bundle;;
If not a special edition;;
Yeah most likely. Right now there is an Anthem bundle;;
If they announce a special edition I might swap this One X for that üòÇ;;
If they do and by then feel more comfortable with my finances, yeah pretty much. I don't think they've announce a release date yet...so maybe there is still time;;
Most probably an E3 announcement;;
Yeah, the game looks phenomenal;;
"Should label a ""Cyberpunk 2077 funds"" Jar";;
And put some money in it;;
Yeah üòÖ;;
I've been saying that if Cyberpunk 2077 fails, I will lose all hopes lol;;
Naah;;
Highly doubtful;;
They have the experience and the right people on it;;
Not to mention the time they're taking;;
True true, but it looks to good to be real lol;;
And definitely all the feedback;;
Haha;;
Yep;;
It's like how RDR2 blew everyone's mind;;
Very true, they took the time, the resources and made a piece of art;;
There will always be someone who's not satisfied though;;
Exactly. Worth the wait;;
I can't say that I'm not satisfied with RDR2, but I did have a hard time getting use to the controls. But it's definitely one of the best game that came out this last decade;;
Yeah, the whole initial part in the snow is to get used to the controls lol;;
Guys, <@207416847019016202> is officially AFFILIATE now! ;;
CONGRATS COMRADE!!!;;
Wohoo;;
Are we doing a celebratory stream?üòÄ;;
Very cool !!!;;
We should lol;;
haha thanks;;
i need to catch up with the chat;;
#1 spot is still yours  <@207416847019016202> worry not;;
big gratz my dude <@207416847019016202>;;
thank you so much dude <@278571432588345345>;;
i hate filling forms;;
Was it in Russian?;;
How is atom rpg going?  <@207416847019016202>;;
its hard to tell, i tend more to chat than to play;;
and today i got singdeath and mangos voices at the end of stream;;
and we mostly chatted;;
so maybe i got bored by atom a little;;
Hey <@488734758847905803> and <@348165887347523594> you guys free for some apex?;;
next stream i will do just elder scrolls legends so i would be able just to chat;;
mostly in english <@455797717763883009>;;
then i had to create paypal account in russian;;
Nice!;;
<@207416847019016202> you didn't invite me to chat?;;
Now I'm jealous.;;
It's because I'm not a fan of How I met your Mother?;;
i did invite anyone, it was in <#540304697572196363>  and i said it with voice on stream haha <@345380744375566338>;;
but also you need to watch at least 8 seasons haha;;
9 is cool, but kinda filler;;
I am thinking of just streaming with no camera. I just don't know how I cAn get a consistent schedule. It's hard for me during the day. Maybe just a weekend thing. Chill relax game and hangout. But all you guys are always streaming.;;
for me its usually easier to listen to stream when he have camera on, but its not mandatory, if streamer speaks actively;;
like <@416803598173995018>;;
Im going to get a camera eventually. Probably sometime in June;;

I don't understand;;

Fucking great playing with you again <@348165887347523594> and <@488734758847905803> . Best community there is here!;;
<@488734758847905803> why don't you answer your own question?;;
<@488734758847905803> lmao man...I don't know, but it has been fun sucking together;;
<@416803598173995018> Same here man ...I can't get enough of this community;;
I think it's the people we play with <@524820041976250368> üòâ;;
I think so too! <@348165887347523594>;;
üòÖ;;
lmao yeah <@524820041976250368>;;
I was mostly talking about myself;;
yeah <@416803598173995018> it's awesome playing with you guys;;
lmao <@351323158826975232> because i was asking for myself hahahaha;;
<@348165887347523594> I love the mango tree as well;;
Haha I know lol <@488734758847905803>;;
I'm actually getting ready to ask some of you guys to be recruiters;;
"PurpleMango to recruiters: ""Make me an army worthy of Mordor""";;
lmao;;
that's right;;
been a while since i've seen ya <@351323158826975232> , how have ya been?;;
Given that any time longer than 12 minutes is a while spent away from here,  It's hardly remarkable. Nevertheless it is going as dandy as a dandelion;;
lmao that's true;;
good to hear üòÉ;;
<@488734758847905803> You ask, we'll try to do bro;;
are we recruiting for <@488734758847905803> pyramid scheme?;;
Yeah this community rocks. Just got another apex win. My teammate had 9 kills üòÆ;;
<@488734758847905803> I used to do recruiting lol so I‚Äôm good to help with that;;
And I like the LOTR reference too so I‚Äôm extra good to help! Lol;;
congrats <@416803598173995018> !;;
Lol thanks. The guy who had 9 kills obviously carried me haha. Some people are already so damn good at this game;;
It really is addicting lol;;
it really is addicting man;;
"Kinda laughed when <@348165887347523594> said ""if this pain comes with no explanation"". Because, you know, usually you open your mail and there's letter from your body, explaining why you're feeling pain.";;
Morning to everyone;;
Morning everyone, what's up for the day?;;
Morning  <@87241615671832576>;;
üëÄ;;
How are you;;
Marks daughter, can you please untape marks mouth, so he could say how he loves us?;;
Lol;;
‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§;;
I have no clue about what's going on;;
It's in <#512649569595555860>  <@87241615671832576>;;
Ahh :) That's way to early for me;;
Oh good, I will come up with some jokes then;;
You wanted to play some puzzle game, did you check it you yet?  <@87241615671832576>;;
Yeahh I played it on Monday :);;
Oh good. How is It?;;
Can you remind me name?;;
üòÇ;;
It was named Euklidian skies and it was an okay game. A bit to hard for me though, the mobile version looked way cooler though, as it is in an AR environment where you can walk around the puzzles.;;
Euklidian skies!!! yes!;;
thats the name;;
dobroye utro <@207416847019016202>;;
good morning <@87241615671832576>;;

haha yes;;
oh good, so we have 10 minutes to talk;;
haha;;
what up people;;
hey <@442488674144223242>;;
all good;;
Morning fellas üêº;;
good morning!;;
morning <@455797717763883009>;;
How's everyone's thursdays?;;
mine is good;;
as good as any other day;;
yeh good;;
finally had a chance to go through game footage and get a new vid up;;
good to hear guys!;;
hbu <@455797717763883009>;;
Day started with the city bike service down, so had to walk to work;;
hm;;
interesting;;
Otherwise, same old same old;;
we have bicycle services, but its in no way convinent;;
it just for fun or for tourists;;
I've been using it for 1.5 years now;;
Trams arre slow;;
not that you could use it for going to work;;
Not many bicycle paths?;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c;;
HYPEE;;
very very not many <@455797717763883009>;;
and they mostly in downtown;;
and they not convinient if, you know, you want to go from place to place;;
also, its a big city;;
bycicle trip from work to home would take me 2-3 hours;;
and i would not cross any bicycle path;;
Yeah, Milan is not that big in that way. You can cycle from one end to the other within an hour;;
you can ride a car from one end of moscow to another within a 20-40 minutes, but at night, when theres no traffic jams;;
and in metro, in 40-60 minutes;;
Big cities are always sometimes messy to get around;;
well metro+buses are good here;;
so its actually no troubles to get around;;
its just, moscow shape is circle, with diameter like 30 km, its tough to go anywhere by walking or on bycicle;;
"i had bicycle rides across moscow, like ""from here to other side of the city and back"", and it was like 70-80 km trips for 7-8 hours";;
Yeah it's huge. Here I mostly walk round or take the bicycke;;
and me and my gf we can walk arounf city, but you know, 8-12 km max;;
In the snow? Brr ‚ùÑ;;
why in the snow?;;
i mean, sometimes we walk in the snow;;
but you dont think that snow is whole year in russia?;;
also, moscow is getting cleaned pretty good from snow;;
No i was just generally talking about the cold weather;;
Haha not the whole year. But yeah, I've seen snow for not more than 2-3 days;;
well its no problem to walk around in cold too;;
and as i was saying, moscow is 100 times better than st petersburg in terms of cleaning streets and such;;
i will suggest not going there any time aside from summer;;
but moscow i think all right all year;;
but still in summer its better;;
Yeah summer is better for me.;;
More of a tropical person. haha;;
hey <@488734758847905803> look what i found <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;

is today - the next day? can you go to doctor now?;;
shit hope it's nothing serious;;
I go at 9am in 2 and a half hours;;

<@416803598173995018> this is insane...I've been talking a lot here...and can't keep up with your fast growing dongle;;
You could sound like Arthur if you tried. Should be easy for you haha;;
<@416803598173995018>;;
<@524820041976250368> very well;;
<@207416847019016202> it's a great emoji though haha;;
No, better try sadie  voice   <@416803598173995018>;;
It all God's work  <@348165887347523594>;;
And by God i mean <@409836692158021632>;;

<@207416847019016202>I feel liek thats a girl lol;;
<@207416847019016202> I knew <@409836692158021632> had a secret...I just knew it;;
Yeah she is... <@416803598173995018>;;
Wait, you didn't play yet?;;
Haha Sadiee;;
<@207416847019016202> I have but not very much so I dont know who that is;;
damn, this is weird, I was sure Anthem was out today...I don't know why I was sure it was;;
Haha Early Access tomorrow;;
Release 22nd;;
I think it's because Metro, Crackdown and Far Cry reviews are out;;
Maybe lol;;
I'ts fine though...I had to throttle the download so I could still use my internet ...so it is still at 35% in;;
I was just about to accelerate the download and noticed it wasn't coming out until tomorrow.;;
You Pre-ordered?;;
I'm on access premier;;
origin;;
Ah sweet;;
Pre load?;;
yeah since yesterday;;
Gonna check if i can do it from work;;
I was wondering if my origin access premier account works also on my xbox;;
That's EA access. Separate;;
Ok damn it;;
Are you just going to ask me every day now <@348165887347523594> when I am getting anthem? lol;;
haha;;
No no lol, I know you 're not going to get it right now lol <@416803598173995018>;;
So much hype around it. it better be good;;
Even though I felt like asking you again <@416803598173995018>  üòÖ;;
lol yeah I am going to wait. I will rent it first, Im going to start doing that with every game. I got burned my spider man and I just havent really liked red dead either. Feels like a waste of money for me;;
lol <@348165887347523594>;;
Damn Spiderman and RDR2?;;
<@416803598173995018> Renting is a good idea;;
How do you rent a new game?;;
<@455797717763883009> spider man got so boring so quickly for me. It was too repetitive;;
"they have places called ""redbox"" here in the states that you can rent from";;
It got repetitive once i finished it;;
Ohh;;
<@416803598173995018> I liked both lol...I haven' t finished RDR2 but I only blame it on myself;;
"All we've got here is the fuckall ""GameStop""";;
Finished Spider-Man in a week though;;
Took 2 months with Red Dead;;
I finished spider real quickly....I loved it;;
And we got internet here and we don't bother with physical stores  <@455797717763883009>  <@416803598173995018>;;
gamestop's are dying here lol thank god;;
<@207416847019016202> lol yes we have that too but you cant rent online, I dont think;;
Yeah no renting online;;
But I should never leave a game like RDR2 to start playing another. That is what happened. I have not found the courage yet to get back to RDR2 even though I know it's a great game.  The learning curve scares me;;
Atleast I can go trade in the physical ones;;
<@348165887347523594> I think thats what happened to me too. The story was getting a little slow and I went back to Rainbow Six Siege to get immediate satisfaction and just never went back to RDR2;;
Yeah, I was looking for immediate fun me too at a certain point....let the game go for a week or so, and never could get back to it. Then I was pressed to play Metro last last redux, and Wolfenstein 2...and you name it ...I haven't been able to get back to it yet.;;
From now on, when I start something, I'm just going to keep to that one game I'm playing to make sure I finish it.;;
Yeah same for me. I should have just stuck with it;;
RDR 2 to me is one of those great games that isn't all the time fun and exciting. It can get , not boring but tedious or just a shore sometimes....I just wanted to run a game and have some raw fun....like you said immediate satisfaction.;;
Exactly. Lol kind of like how apex has been the past week;;
Yeah lol, I haven't been playing any solo player since apex came out haha;;
Well... you still play solo with dongle? <@348165887347523594>;;
Or is it coop too?;;
It's been solo for sometime now <@207416847019016202> üòÖ;;
Haha apparently it's due to bad connection  <@348165887347523594>;;
Lmao;;
I know  <@416803598173995018> plays coop, but it's very expensive;;
Hahahaha <@207416847019016202> it is sometimes;;
You streaming today? <@207416847019016202>;;
Anny of you play mobiles games?;;
I've been playing Clash of clans for years now...but this game is getting so time consuming;;
I played a little PUBG a few months ago on mobile but it got annoying, that was really it;;
Ok;;
lol my friend plays that and said it takes over his life sometimes;;
clash of clans I mean;;
It really does;;
No, next stream is Saturday  <@416803598173995018>;;
Cause you have so many imperatives(if this is the right word). So many quests and challenges and clan wars, now leagues of clans. And your clan counts on you to do all these things;;
<@207416847019016202> ok, was hoping to have some entertainment at work today lol. <@348165887347523594> yeah that's alot to keep up with;;
It's hard to leave a game that has taken almost 6 years of you life...but I'm feeling like I can't do it anymore;;
Haha sorry, but it will be dull work day for you   <@416803598173995018>;;
I did with dota 2  <@348165887347523594>;;
<@416803598173995018> And your clan members will get mad at you...I mean really. Sometimes the nicest members will go all crazy and start cursing. 50 members going mad for losing a war or losing ranks is not fun lol;;
Some stuff you gotta leave behind;;
<@278571432588345345> I heard dota 2 was very time consuming too. My friend told me his entire clan imploded;;
<@207416847019016202> thank you for your positive words lol <@348165887347523594> yeah that doesnt sound fun lol;;
<@278571432588345345> hey! How you doing?;;
Doing great man and you?  <@416803598173995018>;;
Last week we were losing the clan war league. The cclan Chief started to use some very nasty words towards co-leaders...I just said fuck it I'm not doing it haaaha;;
<@278571432588345345> just bored at work lol;;
<@348165887347523594> yeah I dont blame you. Its just a game, not like its pro level or something so no need to get so upset;;
I was wondering if guys ever encountered that kind of behavior on not mobile games?;;
Yeah <@416803598173995018>;;
not on mobile games but definitely on console;;
"And I can't classify this in the ""toxic"" users categories. I put the blame more on the games being too damn completive . We had a meeting with all co-leaders and leaders and admitted that it went out of hands";;
Some dude wanted to buy my coc account for 600 euros...and honestly, I believe that if I had to sell this shit it would cost at least 3000  euros considering the time I've put in it. But I never really considered it like that before.;;
yeah too competitive is probably right. All the issues Ive had is just toxic people on PS4, thats why I set my messages to friends only and I always make party chat cause I dont want to listen to anyone else lol;;
<@348165887347523594> damn thats alot of money lol;;
6 years playing almost 40 hours a week is priceless, But i guess this is what free to play gaming has come too.;;
lol yeah I think so as well;;
Damn. Clash of clans?  <@348165887347523594>;;
Clash of clan is the  only mobile game I will ever invest so much time on...when I'm done, I won't even try any of them anymore;;
Yes <@455797717763883009>;;
I even dated a girl I met on that game;;
Wow;;
That game gave you a girl and some money for your time;;
haha yeah;;
Only mobile game I played for more than a month would be Pok√©mon Go;;
Pokemon go was a god damn phenomenon;;
I never played it since all my time was given to coc;;
It was. And will go down I'm history as the game that got everyone's ass outside;;
<@455797717763883009> so true lol;;
lol I played that for like 3 months. Was fun and then got boring for me but yeah <@455797717763883009> it definitely got people to be active lol;;
I would go out at midnight to the stream nearby to catch a squirtle;;
And then directed a bunch of kids to where you can catch them;;
I heard some people getting hit by cars playing Pokemon go...I don't know if it's true though;;
Haha yes;;
This is crazy;;
Only game I remember having this effect on people was POGs and it wasn't even a video game;;
I spent my birthday drinking beer and walking around this huge park to catch this one evasive charizard;;
Good job <@!455797717763883009>, your dongle just grew to 11!;;
<@455797717763883009> üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;
Yeah. Good times lol;;
Now I just go out to get groceries;;
Waiting for that Harry Potter game from Niantic;;
lol;;
Lot of Potter heads in my city;;
Including me lol;;
Really haha;;
Yeah. It definitely had a positive effect on me;;
I don't know how many members here are old enough to remember POGs....that was a pretty crazy time too.;;
The guys that created it made billions;;
What's POGs;;
Hang on, gonna find a link that explains what it was;;
Ah its like tazos;;
http://mentalfloss.com/article/54202/weird-history-pogs;;
Yeah, it finally got banned from schools for obvious reasons as the craze was getting out of hands. It was like money for us kids...Gambling for teenagers . I remember big brawls exploding in my schools because some rich kid would decide to distribute them out the windows.;;
A pog was worth 1 Franc back then (before we had euros), and 1 euros is about 6 francs. So this shit was like real money for teens and kids;;
Wish that a lot of money;;
For back then;;
Yeah read how it got banned and then the craze disappearing;;
Yeah, it wasn't sitting well with parents at all. It was getting violent. And pickpocketing pogs was a real thing;;
There‚Äôs just a lot of pot heads in my city <@455797717763883009> lol;;
Lol  <@416803598173995018>;;
I remember pogs lol;;
I just remember Tazos;;
Because we got milk from a guy who delivered it in cans;;
I think different brands tried to do their own;;
You had to go hold a bowl and get it filled from a bigger can on a bicycle;;
Has the Mango Council disbanded?;;
Why <@498246547838992414> ?;;
I was wondering why Orange wasn't in it, and why <@193534318704852993>'s name wasn't yellow;;
Just curiosity;;
I think that now they put it up to votes;;
On the vote channel ...(I think);;
Ah yeah;;
it was, now its voting <@498246547838992414>;;
*a democracy*;;
what a strange name you have today <@498246547838992414>;;
I decided to spice it up a little <@207416847019016202>;;
lol;;
Lol back to normal <@498246547838992414>;;
I will never return to normal;;

<@524820041976250368> hope it all goes well;;
This clip reminds me so much of Police Academy;;
Now should we worry about <@278571432588345345> 's dongle too  ü§î;;

<:fry_ns:423742470216482827>;;

hahaha;;
<@278571432588345345> howd you get a futurama emoji??;;

Fucking hell, apparently lol;;

<:kfc:537956449439973376>;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> this is the only emoji I care about anymore;;
Fuckin KFCCCC;;
:kfc:;;
zzz;;
God damn now you're are just reminding me how horrible life is without KFC;;
ohhh I need kfc;;
Ive only had KFC once in my life, maybe twice lol. I havent had it for probably 15 years;;
It's far from my place and the traffic is bad here;;
I wonder if fast food is better in other places. It's really gross here in the states I think;;
I wish! <@207416847019016202> and thank you! <@498246547838992414> <@348165887347523594> <@416803598173995018>;;
It's not bad here <@416803598173995018>;;
Take care <@524820041976250368>;;
<@416803598173995018> In the states, I only went to 24 hour dinners for fast food <@416803598173995018>;;
I will! <@455797717763883009>;;
<@348165887347523594> some of those places can be good. I wish the food here was like the food we had in France. God the food was so good everywhere there. Fresh, no preservatives and all that crap;;
<@416803598173995018> ha, but didn't you think it was quite expensive. I admit that I like french food a lot;;
<@416803598173995018> But I miss Deny's;;
<@348165887347523594> I'll stuff my face in your honour;;
<@278571432588345345> hahahaha,  well you are too good;;
<@348165887347523594> the places we went to weren't bad. We paid about the same as we would here or less. I've never eaten at Denny's lol;;
One thing that I can confirm, I stay away from Mc Donald's. I don't like it where ever I try it .;;
I don't even like driving next to a Mc Donald's. I find the smell repulsive.;;
not even morning mcdonalds? <@348165887347523594>;;
What's a morning mcdonalds?;;
You mean 24hour mcdonads?;;
I think he means their breakfast food;;
yeah;;
There is something about the smell that repulses me. I can't say cause I haven't tried their breakfast for a while.;;
their breakfast menu is totally different;;
i mean, totally;;
ok;;
and buns are different;;
so maybe its even different smell üòÄ;;
Maybe lol...I like breakfast buns though.;;
I don't remember when was the last time I tried mcdonalds;;
Maybe you are right;;
<@416803598173995018> you clearly have never been to Chick-fil-a;;
I like your buns <@348165887347523594> üòô;;
<@345380744375566338> yeah I have, only once though;;
It's the ONLY place I go visit home;;
<@416803598173995018> üòÇ üòÖ ü§ó;;
When I visit;;
yeah its not bad. I just dont really like fast food in general. I always feel like crap afterwards;;
I hear you. Chick-fil-A has actual food though. I never felt sick. They have great salads;;
What I don't like are sandwiches in general;;
Ive been there once so I honestly dont even remember what I got lol;;
Damn the states have a lot of Fast-food joints;;
I only know McD and KFC of the lot;;
They do <@455797717763883009>;;
And mcd is not one of the best;;
yeah its cause everyone here is fat and lazy lol so they need fast food;;
The only thing i have in McD is Coke float;;
lol;;
Wait people have breakfast at mcdonalds?;;
Like what?;;
I remember in all my time in the U.S...I would only cook noodles;;
Lok;;
Man I looove noodles;;
Noodles every day for years.;;
Got thru my masters on noodles;;
<@278571432588345345> exactly lol;;
lol yeah my first year at college I lived on noodles;;
Got through my masters on Kebabs;;
I became a noodle master after a while;;
How did you survive  <@455797717763883009>?;;
<@455797717763883009> god damn, same question here haha;;
I didn't üòÇ;;
Lol;;
It was a tough time;;
But thenn there was pizzas too;;
Thanks Mario & luigi for that;;
Whats the deal with Europe and kebabs? lol I always see stuff about kebabs on the Europe subreddits;;
Hahaha its a virus;;
Pizza Kebab is a legit dish on the menu. In ITALY!;;
Yeah;;
So gud;;
lol we have them all over the place here too;;
But will make you obese or dead;;
well in the area Im in at least;;
Kebabs are so guuuuuuud;;
yeah they are;;
Yeah i gained a bit during that period;;
Being a true panda;;
üêº;;
Ho one other thing I don't like much in the U.S...well at least where I've been are pizzas....they are so thick;;
Ya dude;;
Too thicc pizza;;
You went to the wrong pizza places then lol;;
Way to thicc;;

Here in europe when you see american pizza it's always deep pan;;
Not a fan of those;;
I mean its still good;;
But not the same;;
like this style?;;
Ho yucc,;;
Damn that IS thicc;;
Chicago style lol. They call it deep dish;;
Yeah, doesn't taste the same as wood fired pizza;;
Not like that, not that thiccc;;
not for me;;
i dont like it that way;;
impossible to eat;;
;;
Like that is my favorite;;
Yess;;
Oh yeah;;
Italian thin;;
The best way;;
This is how eurropen pizzas look <@416803598173995018>;;
Very thin;;
Nice, thats what Im used too as well;;
Sooo hungry;;
OK. Now I'm hungry;;
only a few places have thick crust here and the first one I sent is a specific type of pizza. It very good but difficult to eat;;
<:kfc:537956449439973376>;;
Good morning, everyone!;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Hey Mark!;;
Yo <@409836692158021632>;;
Creator of my new favorite emoji;;
<@345380744375566338> thank you! I just dabble with the arts every now and then üòÇ;;
Where I've been they were always thick  <@416803598173995018> , but it's been a while so maybe people's taste have change;;
Hello <@409836692158021632>;;
<@348165887347523594> I like my girls a little thick but not my pizza;;
This is why I kept a bad memory of pizzas in the U.S;;
It's HERE <:kfc:537956449439973376>;;
<@416803598173995018> Same thing here haha;;
<@278571432588345345> Enjoy your meal you lucky one;;
lol enjoy <@278571432588345345>;;
<@348165887347523594> lol;;
@kellyd if you eat pizza at a fast food place you are doing it wrong;;
*goes silent and eats*;;
<@345380744375566338> Maybe, thing is where I lived in the U.S...it was mainly papa johns and dominos that were around;;
ohhh thats why then;;
yeah those are shit;;
The best Pizza places in the States usually involve a brick oven, and an old Italian staff;;
I lived in Palm Beach Boca-Raton;;
Ive been to Florida twice and I always thought the pizza there was shit;;
Most of the best places in the states are in the east coast;;
<@345380744375566338> correct;;
<@416803598173995018> well now I know lol;;
NYC Boston, Philly;;
They have east coast places here in Cali but theyre not the same. Very good but not as good;;
Youll never beat a true NY pizza;;
I hope I'm gonna get a chance travel to the U.S very soon. Every year I keep pushing it to next year;;
Boston or NY are cool cities to visit. I dunno, honestly I dont think theres that many great places to see here lol;;
Most of the country is just boring with nothing in it. Id rather travel all over Europe but thats just me;;
<@416803598173995018> This is what I say about Martinique, but people seem to love visiting down here;;
Well I take that back. If you like nature etc Yellowstone national park is very beautiful and there are places in Washington and other states that are gorgeous to see but not like Europe and all its history;;
Colorado is nice;;
Ive never even heard of where you live before you said it lol but it does look beautiful there;;
yeah Colorado is nice for outdoors stuff, very beautiful landscapes;;
I'm sure I will find a bunch of amazing place to see in the states that are unique;;
It depends on what you like to experience. History, culture, nature, etc;;
Btw  <@348165887347523594> Anthem preload is only for Premium subscribers. Not for basic and EA Access on Xbox;;
<@455797717763883009> So only origin subs right?;;
Will need to load it tomorrow morning at 10am;;
Yeah only Origins Premium. Not the Basic tier;;
<@345380744375566338> you nailed it;;
<@345380744375566338> True, I'more of and history and culture , nature comes after.;;
So you'd like the northeast then;;
Philly, Boston and NY;;
Those are the places that this country started in;;
<@455797717763883009> I'm sure it's not as an issue for you as it would've been for me. My internet is shit.;;
<@416803598173995018> Cool. Noted üòâ;;
Nature is good, but where I live,nature is overwhelmingly all around;;
D.C. isn't bad either if you like some history as well. <@348165887347523594> honestly if you visited the East coast you could visit big cities with history and their own culture. And great pizzaüçï;;
Even my garden is good enough;;
oh fuck I forgot about DC lol;;
How big is the file?;;
51 gigs <@455797717763883009>;;
Not bad. Shouldn't take more than 3-4 hours;;
<@345380744375566338> Yeah, more the type of destination that I would aim for;;
I read that quickly and thought you said 3-4 months lol;;
Lol;;
I was like god damn! Kelly's internet really is bad!;;
üòÇ;;
lmao;;
Thats worse than Internet Explorer;;
Well, honestly, with my internet, without my expensive sometimes downloading a game can take up 2 weeks or so;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 23!;;
damnit!;;
Wow;;
stop talking so much kelly;;
looool <@416803598173995018>;;
Don‚Äôt visit California in February lol. It is not sunny and warm;;
Im trying to catch up! lol now youre 3 ahead of me again;;
It takes so much time because I have other stuff to do with my internet than just waiting for a game to download, so I'll stop it or throttle it <@455797717763883009>;;
<@416803598173995018> hooo it does look grey;;
Yeah its very dark lol pic doesnt do it justice;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>  I ‚ù§ <@488734758847905803>;;
lol!;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>  weak americans!;;
<@409836692158021632> knows what I mean, weather is shit here lately;;
It is shit here in summer <@416803598173995018>;;
haha yeah <@416803598173995018> I'm soaked right now;;
Like the worst time to come here is summer;;
lol <@409836692158021632> it captures him so perfectly;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>  weak american weather! come to Russia!;;
I read that in <@207416847019016202>  voice üòÇ;;
üòÇ <@416803598173995018> it needs 200% more hate I think;;
It's hurricane season here in summer and that kind of sucks for my renting business. <@416803598173995018>;;
<@348165887347523594> I imagine its very hot in the summer there and busy;;
since <@207416847019016202> is a very toxic internet person;;
ahhh ok;;
lmao <@409836692158021632>;;
IT's gets very hot and rainy;;
is the weather humid there?;;
We have the same weather pattern than Florida. But less humid though;;
ahhh ok. Florida has awful humidity;;
Its very dry here;;
<@416803598173995018> Florida is way more humid...I can't even compare ...It's humid here but Florida is just unbearable ...People here don't need A.C to live;;
<@348165887347523594> lol yeah my Mom lives in Florida. If you dont have AC, you die there;;
But we have the same weather pattern, meaning that we get the storms and hurricanes ..then Florida gets it like a day or two after.;;
<@416803598173995018> Exactly lol..like really haha;;
discord is perfect way to look busy at work when its dead by the way lol. People come by and they see me typing and leave me alone hahaha;;
<@416803598173995018> üòÇ üòÇ;;
nice;;
Yeah I could never live in Florida;;
Need to watch more pro gamers play apex, they play so differently and are obviously so good at it;;
Without a.c, I honestly think it wouldn't be possible. And we're not even talking about the insects;;
do you have mosquitos?;;
<@416803598173995018> yeah, I need to see how they can get +100 kills  in such a short time;;
<@416803598173995018> Not where I live no...depends of the time of the year...but it's not a big issue;;
Im watching some now, its amazing lol;;
oh thats good, we dont have them here really either but in Boston they were everywhere. Nasty little demons;;
Happy Valentine's Day, y'all!;;
Same to you Mark!;;
Everywhere there is water,  there will be mosquitoes.;;
Haha <@416803598173995018>  they get suspicious when I'm seen typing a lot;;
<@409836692158021632> same thing to you;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> ‚ù§;;
lol <@455797717763883009> what do you do for work?;;
you too <@348165887347523594> !;;
3D artist;;
So mostly modelling something;;
ahhh ok, so more mouse movements than typing id imagine;;
Yup. Sometimes I just put a tutorial on full screen. looks like I'm working <:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840>;;
lol thats awesome. Days like today when its really slow, I just hang out here and watch streams;;
gotta try and get my dongle as big as kellys;;
oh that's awesome <@455797717763883009>;;
Haha yeah 3D is fun  <@409836692158021632>;;
Sometimes frustrating. But it's good;;
<@416803598173995018> today is damn slow;;
<@455797717763883009> agreed, its going by very slow today. Weather is dark and rainy so thats not helping either lol;;
I cant even draw a stick figure well lol so I appreciate all types of artists;;
It starts with a stick figure, once you're past it. It's all a breeze;;
Oh who am I kidding <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Never <@416803598173995018>;;
<@455797717763883009> lol yeah not everyone can be an artist. Some day I will catch your dongle! <@348165887347523594>;;
I'm do my best to keep this from happening lol;;
Lol;;
For every word you say, I'll post 3;;
The xp count is only one message per minute right?;;
doesnt work that way though lol Each time you post a message you get a random number of XP between 15 and 25.;;
;;
To avoid flood, you can only gain xp once per minute.;;
Yeah exactly;;
damn it damn it damn it;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Hahaha;;
fucking love that emoji;;
Well in this case, i'll do what's best...I'll just pray;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> <@416803598173995018> wants to catch <@348165887347523594> 's dongle???;;
pray to the dongle gods lol;;
Exactly lol;;
you know it! Gonna grab the dongle and make it mine;;
üôÑ;;
lmao;;
<@409836692158021632> He is trying. <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
How you doing today? <@409836692158021632>;;
Once you guys see my face, I'll have you make an emoji too lol;;
soaked haha. how are you?;;
<@416803598173995018> emoji will be Brad Pitt;;
lol;;
Brad Pitt aka the slightly less better looking me;;
<@409836692158021632> bored at work lol. When it rains, its usually slow here. Not a bad thing though;;
<@416803598173995018> voice and looks. Why aren't you in Hollywood? <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
I am....;;
I mean I work close by at least;;
lol;;
that's cool <@416803598173995018> slow work pace leaves you more time to think about Apex;;
lol yep Im watching pros stream it so I can try and learn lol;;
you main Wraith, right?;;
I do, probably shouldnt but I do lol;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUFwunMKa4E;;
FUCK! This looks so good;;
damn, that does look good;;
whens it being released?;;
March 15th;;
"<@416803598173995018> Wraith is good. Which pro are you watching for Wraith ""research""?";;
Nice! That‚Äôs soon. None of them so far have been using wraith which makes me think I probably shouldn‚Äôt use her lol. She‚Äôs not anything special, I just feel like she plays faster than the other legends. I like speed over everything else;;
Wraith is excellent, man. Dr. Disrespect mains Wraith and he's a beast with her.;;
Her phasing and portal ultimate open up a lot of tactics and strats.;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wka5RovFEo8;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> Neill Blomkamp!!!;;
Oh really? I‚Äôll have to watch him later then. I need to get better with the portals for sure;;
I'll look for other pros that use Wraith and DM them to you later along with the noods;;
Lmao just the pro wraith stuff please hahaha. Noods not necessary;;
ok...I tried...;;
Unless they are orange noods...;;
Dude if Neil Bloomkamp is doing a trailer for it...it must be good...Fuck it I know now...deep inside the deepest tunnels and wonders of my dongle this game will be good;;
Exactly;;
I just watched it....I hate doing this but it looks like they have been hiding lots of great things .;;
And concerning the release dates...I've been reluctant about giving my 2 cents about it. It doesn't really  bother me. What I mean, is that I don't mind getting the game before others if I did pay for a special access. Not that I care so much, but to me it's just a way to get a special treatment.;;
Yeah now it's all about that premium treatment;;
I have paid for many things in my  life to get special treatment, and I feel no shame. In game purchases. Special seats for a show, lots of Champaign to feel like a star in certain  clubs you name it .;;
Doesn't matter to me. It's good they have a 10 hour trial going on;;
Agreed;;
If I like it, I might be getting it;;
Yep;;
Let's see how it goes tomoorrow;;
wait <@455797717763883009> is in this discord wtf;;
Lol <@160543395037708288>;;
I think he has been for a while lol;;
mind blown;;
Yeah I was off for more than a month;;
I'm back now;;
I think I remember you being more here when I joined indeed...than nothing until lately;;
Boy ho boy, that trailer by itself is exciting...just a day before release..;;
When did you join?;;
<@455797717763883009> About a month ago;;
Oh not so long ago;;
No really, but it feels like I've been here for longer haha;;
Haha it always feels like that;;
<@455797717763883009> damn that Blomkamp trailer!!!;;
right? <@409836692158021632>;;
I don‚Äôt even remember when I joined lol. It wasn‚Äôt more than a few months ago. Maybe 2?;;
maybe;;
im here 2 months too;;
i really appreciate that you force my emote so much <@416803598173995018>;;
im pretty sure you want to use it on twitch <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Lol obviously I want to use it on there too;;
üíµ üíµ üíµ üíµ üíµ;;
Help me grow my dongle past Kelly and I‚Äôll put the emoji everywhere I can lol;;
I gotta get mine done soon too lol. I don‚Äôt even have any subs though;;

pretty accurate;;
thank you, Orange üò¢;;
hahaha;;
you already working on image of the hole as an autoportrait? <@409836692158021632>;;

I'm not sure, Orange. maybe Sunday with my daughter. I'll let you know.;;

Fuck he has a lot of ads though;;
ill try to be on your stream <@409836692158021632>;;

Good job <@!345380744375566338>, your dongle just grew to 6!;;
thats not too bad for temperature;;
hahaha what a great message to grow your dongle too;;

Lol;;
You have the most popular avatar in chat;;
i work 10-19, officially. (10 am - 7 pm) ;;
"but i got pretty loose schedule, its more about ""do your work"" that ""sit your hours"", so i wake up at 9-10 and arrive at work at 10-11, and leave at 17-18 <@416803598173995018>";;
so sometimes last days its just 11-17;;
Thats pretty nice;;
and i stream at 19:30, so its no way for me to do it if i was strict on work schedule;;
My schedule is much stricter lol. What games you thinking of playing tonight?;;
dont know... maybe ill continue wolfenstein bad blood, maybe some apex dying with randoms (cant do mic already), and maybe something else...;;
i dont remember if you was there, but last 40 minutes of my stream yesterday we just voice chatted with mango and singdeath <@416803598173995018>;;
i think you left;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
I haven't played that wolfenstein yet. I do love those games though. Yeah unfortunately I had to go and do work stuff but I heard about it;;
lol sorry;;
I have to leave now for work stuff for about 20 minutes too, forgive me!;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
okay, ill forgive, but you need to use emoji a lot;;
i just started that wolfenstein recently, just in very beginning;;

yeah orange it doesnt matter how many mangos, you will always triumph;;
i love that my emoji is really bigger;;
well, not ony emoji;;
your dongle too;;
<:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840>;;
hahaha;;
somebody said dongle? <@348165887347523594>  is here;;
<@416803598173995018> There is lots of stealth in Wolfensteins  is you decide to play it this way;;
<@348165887347523594> I never do lol. Always go in guns blazing! haha;;
well bad blood in the start really pushes you to stealh. like. really;;
<@207416847019016202> I can't get away from this chat a second lol....You guys never stop chatting;;
even to the point that you can get a gun, but when you go to the next door, character drops gun and go melee again;;
<@416803598173995018> Yeah, and maybe it's more fun this way. I've been battling myself to play differently;;
lol I only do it that way cause I suck at stealth for the most part;;
so why waste my time? Im gonna get noticed anyways so;;
wait kelly, stop talking! Im catching up to you;;
I do think that it would suck to watch a full gameplay of Wolfenstein the way I play it;;
Here's how Orange plays stealth...;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> - Stealth!;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> Die Die Die;;
<@207416847019016202> It's like metro, I played both 2033 and last light with almost zero kills..But watching <@160543395037708288>'s gameplay felt more balanced.;;
well i suck at stealth more than i suck at anything;;
lol <@409836692158021632>;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> I suck!;;
dongles?;;
and i hate mandatory stealth when game over if you fails;;
Yeah that and escorting people in missions is really annoying;;
Escorting is the worst;;
I understand though, I just can't help getting the no kill achievements;;
That's pretty impressive <@348165887347523594>;;
i love stealth, but when i do it, if someone catches me i dont restart;;
i just go along with it;;
especially for a first run;;
i just react;;
oh hey <@160543395037708288>;;
<@416803598173995018> I'm a king in now kills gameplay though;;
oh hey <@207416847019016202> i NEED you man;;
so many russian signs;;
cyka blyat;;
<@160543395037708288> It's much more fun and entertaining;;
haha;;
üòÑ <@348165887347523594>;;
you play second metro ?;;
—Å—É–∫–∞ –±–ª—è—Ç—å;;
im almost halfway through;;
finishing it tonight then starting exodus RIGHT away;;
My way is the boring way...and what you guys would take 12 hours to finish, it takes me the double;;
gonna be a loooong night boys;;
I love the metro games;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> I can't read!;;
<@160543395037708288> should be good;;
ya im reaally loving metro;;
quickly making it to my top 10 franchises;;
Metro is one of my fav too;;
oh fuck me, I forgot the new one gets released tomorrow;;
It's crazy. Too many games out, seriously;;
seriously! lol I cant keep track of them all;;
It's like they are trying to make it up to those past years;;
lol yeah probably. Been a lack of great games the past few years;;
Yep, it has been pretty bad;;
Ill still wait to buy all of them though;;
Last year was good but none really stick out a ton for the past few before;;
Yeah, last year was good....Since E3 actually. Well I bought my first ps4 after E3;;
<@416803598173995018> have you been to E3?;;
I haven‚Äôt but want to so badly;;
isnt E3 in LA?;;
whats the problem?;;
Hey guys little tip for those who plays apex;;
It's for covering Maximum distance at higher speed;;
i didnt even know before that you really control anything when youre jumpmaster haha;;
I'll get you in this year <@416803598173995018>;;
I didn‚Äôt get tickets in time <@207416847019016202> and I wasn‚Äôt following games etc as closely as I am this year so it snuck up on me.;;

<@207416847019016202> , did you get a chance to play that game you won in my giveaway?;;
Ah true that <@348165887347523594>;;

I'm convincing her to download the app on her phone so she can talk to us more;;
I would love to see you guys play a very scary game...like funny scary...Like amnesia or something like that <@416803598173995018> <@488734758847905803> <@207416847019016202> in those times;;

What do you mean <@348165887347523594> ?;;
"in russian we dont have one ""inlaw"" word, but we have fucking separate word for each in law";;
Ah yes;;
In portuguese it's sogro and sogra;;
"you can say just ""anyone in law""";;
in russian its fucking old word for any in law;;
Cunhado is brother in law;;
Cunhada is sister;;
im not only about father/mother;;
Oh damn;;
all that kinda brother in lasw;;

<@488734758847905803> I would be good if you guys play a very scary game like Amnesia some time;;

Well, she doesn't get mine cause it's too small;;
But still, she understands it is what I mean;;
lol I forget why we started saying it so I gotta go back so I can explain it better to her;;
It was the Hitman stream;;
I needed a PC dongle;;
Good ol' times;;
"And I was like ""that's super sexual""";;
Dongle sounds wrong;;
And then it began;;
Yeah <@498246547838992414>;;
What up boi?;;
That's one of my favourite streams of all time;;
Doing good  <@488734758847905803> I just got home;;
Also because of some rl shit I can't stream one week, and can the other;;
So I'm maybe gonna upload stuff to my youtube;;
shitposting;;
hahaha oh thats right, I missed it live but watched it after lol. Whats up? <@498246547838992414>;;
Hows your dongle dangling today?;;
I wonder if that stream is still on twitch;;
I want to get that moment;;
I got home from a pretty easy day at school  <@416803598173995018> so now I'm laying on the sofa, and I'm gonna play some games, I'll maybe stream a bit if I feel upto it;;
<@488734758847905803> Isn't it like really late for you?;;
<@488734758847905803> not sure, I think they save for 30 days? Maybe? <@498246547838992414> its 1313 for him. What games you gonna play?;;
Maybe a bit of Skyrim or rocket league;;
Idk, I'll see;;
Love skyrim, never played rocket league though;;
<@488734758847905803> you're hitman streams are still there, I just dont know which one it was;;
<@455797717763883009> and <@348165887347523594> watching KingGothalion play anthem now, it does look good;;
your*;;
lol now KingGothalion cant get into the game, matchmaking errors. Gonna be watching the Rainbow Six Siege Invitational all day, its playoffs! Love this stuff;;
<@416803598173995018> nice!;;
I'm on my way home. Need to wait till it downloads;;
Haha;;
Hopefully you dont have the issues these guys are having lol;;
Yeah let's see how Xbox fares;;
They are on PC so hopefully better than them! lol;;
Lol true that;;
Whats everyones plans for the weekend?;;
Got a lot of work to do, so I have to be a grown up unfortunately. I'd much rather stream some indie titles.;;
I'm gonna lay in bed for 2 days straight and play some random games;;
Gonna play cards and get some writing done;;
Then do some stream stuff, add some bot commands;;
Wbu <@416803598173995018> ?;;
Lol nice everyone. I‚Äôm gonna try and stream today when I get home from work. Saturday and Sunday will be spent cleaning out my garage and I have Monday off so I‚Äôm going to my friends house to plat video games all day;;
Play*;;
Sounds like a retro console experience ;);
We will probably break out the N64 lol;;
Sounds awsone;;
Super Smash Bros and StarCraft 64 are go to's for us on there;;
Cool;;
<@348165887347523594>  it's only 34 GB on Xbox. Anthem;;
"And thank engineers for the ""Ready to Start"" option. Another 2 GB and I'm ready to go! üòÑ";;
I ready to start like an option to play limited before the game downloads fully?;;
Yup. Like a substantial part of the initial game is installed. So I can play while it downloads on the background;;
I was surprised when I saw it on Apex, Blizzard has been doing it for years and I never understood why other games didn't do it.;;
And stop being so mysterious of the streamer studio thing ;);
<@455797717763883009> that's awesome, I love when games do that;;
I agree with  <@87241615671832576>;;
you guys dont know what the streamer studio thing is?;;
*no*;;
oh man, that sucks. Its so good;;
You are incredibly mean;;
Tell me;;
*now*;;
Cant, its only for people with the rank of Master Chief;;
Yeah yeah;;
You don't even know;;
Or do I/;;
?*;;
I don't want to be a Master Cheif, as I never played Halo;;
I want the princess nyllaa role;;
Halo was one of my favorite games growing up lol;;
I know most people here dont like Rainbow Six Siege but the invitational has been so much fun to watch. I love how Esports are getting big now, man it's so exciting to watch these guys win and go crazy;;
My problem was I didn't have the console, the whole exclusivity deal again.;;
the streamer studio is a VIP only club which requires special access to join;;
so y'all need to sub to Mango NOW;;
How do you earn a right to any role anyway. I have always imagined myself as an indie champion;;
VIP read hentai ;);
<@409836692158021632> should be clip master;;
once you've become a member of the streamer studio you'll get the following perks:;;
1. Mango Bio Butter (1 bottle per month as long as you stay subscribed);;
2. Autographed photo of Purple Mango;;
3. Bigger, thiccer Dongle Emotes;;
Ahh ok, yeah I always had xbox and playstation. I was here when the discord was kinda small and mango just asked what role I wanted lol;;
lmao <@409836692158021632>;;
Me likey  <@409836692158021632>;;
Lol;;
Lol;;
My suit just caught on fire.;;
But man, the game is running smooth;;
good day everyone! glad to see y'all hear and keeping Purple Mango's discord alive and dongling!;;
<@455797717763883009> you're killing me with the Anthem updates! I love it tho! Lemme know if the story is any good!;;
I've been wondering if I should go for an all castle gimmick. Just armor, swords and knights, while fighting for indies.;;
<@455797717763883009> can you get out of the suit or do you just burn alive? lol;;
he can jump in water to cool off;;
Haha it just cools down;;
and there are underwater areas as well;;

Yeah man..the latest one is fucking awesome;;
I'll get it....eventually lol;;
I've had an issue with my anthem installation. It installed on my main ssd drive and filled it up. But wouldn't let me move until now. I'm waiting for the move to be done and I cross my fingers. If it fails...boy this would be catastrophic .;;
Hope it all works out <@348165887347523594>;;
Does this mean no more apex for you? lol;;
If it doesn't, I'm not even going to be able to play it for the next few days....My data plan is almost reached;;

By the way <@488734758847905803> Im spamming your dongle mango emoji in the R6 chat for the invitational lol. People keep asking wtf is that???;;
Just for today at least, I think it's gonna be only anthem....if the install doesn't fuck up;;
I hope it goes through and installs <@348165887347523594>;;

I'm good as well.;;
just doing some editing on my channel and stuff;;
and working on the Streamer Studio twitter and everything;;
that streamer studio is a great idea <@488734758847905803>;;
thanks <@409836692158021632>;;
<@467974634977886220> and I are foking visionaries;;
every time I see foking, I just imagine a Scottish?Irish guy lol;;
lmao me too;;
lol me and <@537319907541516311> are going to have a joint stream too and have an accent challenge;;
soon* not too;;
oh nice!;;
what i kinda hate about discord is unability to quote;;
it kinda makes reading 292 messages pointles;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> ;;
oh no...he's awake!!!;;
because no point in quoting half hout ago message everyone forgot about;;
i wasnt sleeping haha;;
i read it all;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
and thank you for waiting for my stream <@409836692158021632>;;
When's the stream  <@207416847019016202>?;;
it will be fun if you will turn off at that exact time;;
in 12 hours <@455797717763883009>;;
10 am my time;;
Oh no! Baba Yaga is here;;
I was just being nice when I said that, Orange.;;
the time you stream is when I go do other, more important things;;
i see you guys read russian fairy tales;;
"lol honestly, I got it from the movie ""John Wick""";;
i know that its well known thing <@416803598173995018>;;
but baba yaga seems appropriate title for you orange;;
i saw it in couple of games;;
its not <@416803598173995018>;;
baba means grandmother;;
Ok let me specify, baba yaga from john wick does, not the fairy tales;;
hes called the boogeyman in that movie;;
cause he just fucks people up and never dies;;
baba yaga in john wick is a MAN?;;
haha yeah, doesnt seem accurate translation now that you say it means grandmother;;
yeah;;
hes an assassin that is so good and no one can kill, so the russian mob boss calls him baba yaga, or the boogeyman as the explain in the movie;;
what i really hate is how american movies does some russian female surnames;;
yeah thats not good, I didnt know it meant grandmother;;
lol I am reading an article now about how wrong the movie is with calling him baba yaga;;
haha;;
for example, Natasha Romanoff from avengers;;
yeah, <@207416847019016202>  - I agree about quoting. you have to retype the person's message;;
and the guys names who are supposed to be russian are Iosef and Viggo, apparently not Russian names lol;;
Romanoff  is actually Romanov, but its not a point. Romanov is a male surname. Female one would be Romanova, 100%cases, with no exceptions;;
It is a great movie though, outside of those wrong things;;
what movie is that <@416803598173995018> ?;;
so it should be Natasha  Romanova, but fuck, for some stupid reason...;;
Damn, movies really get that stuff really wrong;;
<@488734758847905803> John Wick;;
ah true;;
I love me some keanu;;
actually Dreamfall Chapters got it pretty good and Baba Yaga there is really some old witch, as in russian fairytales <@416803598173995018>;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>  `so it should be Natasha  Romanova, but fuck, for some stupid reason...`;;
lmao;;
<@488734758847905803> Keanu is possibly my favorite celebrity of all time. Is that a movie orange?;;
interesting <@416803598173995018>;;
i like it, i should use emoji in front of my every message;;
I like him, but I think eminem is cooler;;
Dreamfall Chapters is a game, you fucking FPS sicko <:Orange:545555843978887170> <@416803598173995018>;;
Its sequel of old point and click The longest Journey;;
the longest dongle;;
Donglefall Chapters - the sequel;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>  `my favorite game is the longest dongle`;;
lmao;;
the Mango Dongle;;
<@488734758847905803> not cause of his acting, he‚Äôs a very giving human. He‚Äôs had a rough life and gives back way more than most celebrities do. He‚Äôs awesome. <@207416847019016202> sorry comrade, never heard of it lol;;
Donglefall sounds nasty <@488734758847905803>;;
yeah I know, <@416803598173995018> - i think he's an awesome human being;;
Donglefall sounds like... multiple partners;;
i want to vomit when you guys speaking about how its good to help people.... ill return in a minute <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
stop fueling your hate <@207416847019016202> you fok;;
Lmao donglefall;;
found the origin of the dongle joke guys, it's in <#512649569595555860>;;
üòÇ;;
love it!;;
im back;;
if ill stop ill die <@488734758847905803>;;
do you want me to die?;;
maybe;;
how would you die?;;
happily at the age of 85?;;
i always wanted to do it at 120;;
so far im not doing good in that direction;;
yeah, kfc won't increase your longevity;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> üêî;;
I think we'll only hear from <@455797717763883009> and <@348165887347523594> in a few weeks;;
Anthem is amazing;;
Ahaha;;
<@348165887347523594> `yeah having multiple beach houses is cool...but have you played Anthem???`;;
lmao <@409836692158021632> hhahahaha;;

make sure she appreciates you or find a daughter who  does;;
Yeah being alive is cool, but have you tried Anthem?;;
<@488734758847905803> my daughter hates my jokes üò¢;;

<@455797717763883009> `sure it's cool meeting a six foot 2 Panda...but have you played Anthem???`;;
hahaha;;
<@409836692158021632> lmao;;
how come your messages sometimes have that darker border <@409836692158021632> ?;;
<@207416847019016202> robots don‚Äôt die, the my expire or something;;
I DONT UNDERSTAND;;
lmao;;
they get rusty;;
They*;;
Fuck discord mobile app!!!;;
<@409836692158021632> you have a daughter?;;
I found an alternative for quotations;;
use the grave accent before and after the line;;
the grave accent is under the tilde accent;;
yes <@455797717763883009> I have a daughter and a boy and they both love making fun of their old man;;
Why did I think you were 24 years old?üòÑ;;
becoz according to my daughter I am a man-child;;
so you're not far off <@455797717763883009> üòÇ;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> `hate hate hate hate`;;
Hahaha;;
How off am I though? Technically speaking;;
if i had a daughter she would definitely hate my jokes;;
just reverse the numbers and you got it, <@455797717763883009>;;
Woah for real? <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
I still listen to my 8 track;;
Damn, I thought I was second oldest to orange in here lol;;
I have to take meds to remember all your names;;
the Mango Bio Butter keeps me young tho;;
im 24 heh;;
lol, I was reading your messages just now <@488734758847905803> and <@409836692158021632> ...anthem is running as smoothly as mango butter now;;
yassss <@348165887347523594>;;
we just need to convince <@160543395037708288> to play Anthem and our mission is complete <@348165887347523594>;;
zzzz;;
downloading;;
Hooooo shit yeeeeeeeeesss;;
i mean i have it i might as well download;;
doesnt mean i will play it;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> `Anthem is scuffed!`;;
anthem scuffed;;
exodus unscuffed;;
It's not the same Anthem from the demo;;
everything i love about exodus is what i hate about anthem;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> `Anthem was developed by Scuffed Studios`;;
I've got to get use to the new interface ...no more bugs...no more glitches...it was really an old built;;
nah not even talking about bugs or anything;;
just overall game design;;
The menu changed;;
For the best;;
I still wonder why they used such an old build for the demo;;
that ui was herrendous;;
It was;;
Lol <@409836692158021632> yeah man, you old!;;
but game releases with THREE dungeons;;
lol;;
3;;
feels GOOD man;;
Glad you got it to work <@348165887347523594>;;
...;;
<@416803598173995018> thanks man...I was worried lol;;
aaanyways downloading;;
im sure ill play;;
will be fun flying killing shit;;
Just to try it out <@160543395037708288> , you'll make your judgement;;
need to get it on ps4 too to play with my dad if he likes it;;
<@416803598173995018> yeah man...I thought this discord had a senior discount but naw...got tricked again by the Mango!;;
But it's not the same thing I've tried a week ago;;
I mean two weeks ago;;
Just discounted dongles;;
<@160543395037708288> your dad plays games too? naisu!;;
yeee;;
<@160543395037708288> very cool...I'll probably try to get it on multiple platforms;;
destiny mostly, division, anthem, battlefield;;
that's dope, <@160543395037708288>;;
True dat;;
My father plays with his trees in the garden that's all;;
i'll sub to you <@160543395037708288> if you give the Anthem storymode a shot;;
<@160543395037708288> go for itt dude!;;
How you like it <@455797717763883009> ?;;
Really enjoying it. Smooth;;
The fucking game is so great so far...Why would they risk to lose all potential players with those wrecked demos that is my question;;
Need to get used to the flying though;;
I didn't play the demo;;
So is the game better than the beta?;;
So it's all good for me. Now the story is all that matters;;
that's great to hear <@455797717763883009>;;
It's not even close <@416803598173995018> ...the demo were bad if you didn't have the patience;;
Fine <@409836692158021632>;;
Good job <@!160543395037708288>, your dongle just grew to 8!;;
Damn. Maybe the demo helped anthem get where it is now?;;
Im prolly playing it with karak and tkd after the podcast;;
Now that i think about it;;
<@455797717763883009> I don't know...the demo sucked dongles;;
üòÇ <@160543395037708288> ;;
i'll be watching you play it my dude!;;
Lol that‚Äôs good <@348165887347523594> that‚Äôs why they do betas. To work out all the bugs. Just sometimes, companies don‚Äôt fix a lot of the problems so it‚Äôs good to hear that they did;;
It was also called a demo;;
And not beta;;
Which was a mistake;;
On their part;;
<@416803598173995018> The thing is that they weren't betas;;
Also it was the alpha build;;
Ahhh shit ok;;
That was dumb of them;;
Yeah what <@160543395037708288> said;;
Yeah I'm sure there was a lot of feedback;;
I just wanna knoe if they fixed mouse keyboard flying;;
<@455797717763883009> They used 2 months old bettas as demos....so fucking weird;;
<@160543395037708288> I hope they did...this I can't be sure..But I've watched some positive reviews of the latest build on the subject;;
Poor choices. Now I remember people shitting on anthem at that time;;
<@455797717763883009> I'm tenacious this is the only reason why I saw potential...but it was near shit;;
Ok boys...I'm going back to it...Talk to you later mangos and dongles, and oranges of course <:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;

I underestimated Putin;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> `shut up MEE6!`;;
<@409836692158021632> are you really 42? Because you seemed so young, i always thought you were 41;;
lmao;;
So mark is the oldest, Orange is second and I think I am 3rd;;
nope;;
kelly 37;;
I'm youngest;;
At 57;;
im sure crim youngest, he is in school;;
uh, thank you? Orange;;
Oh yea;;
you re just average <@455797717763883009>;;
The Average Panda üêº;;
God damn Kelly is 37?! Shit I thought he was in his 20's;;
<@455797717763883009> I dont believe you lol;;
Haha;;
I'm 26;;
lol yeah that sounds more accurate;;
I cant keep track of all these ages and locations lol;;
i write it down if i cant remember;;
We need to set up like a pinned announcement with everyones info lol;;
or code it in every name;;
like oneMansOranGe29DongleRussianSmarterThanYou;;
but you're not 29 lol;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
!rank;;

You better stay in that level;;
Thats not age;;
its like in apex, you can hide statistics;;
lol good one Orange;;
Your'e Orange crushing mango now;;
You're*;;
i always was;;
Yeah but now you're really taking off lol. He wont catch you;;
It's still my goal to catch Kelly;;
But it is hard;;
like my dongle;;
as i said, i was month behind and catch him up;;
yeah that is good;;
that means my speed was always greater;;
and your dongle was greater;;
I dont understand, what is the story with Anthem? Looks like you just fight creatures;;
i dont know;;
im pretty sure they said several times that story doesnt matter much in that game;;
thats why im not interesting;;
yeah thats too bad, so far it looks repetitive to me;;
Very good looking game but I think I would get bored quickly;;
im pretty sure it is heir to andromeda;;
in terms of more things, like story quality;;
and i hated that in andromeda;;
I didnt like that game;;
The first Mass Effect was good;;
actually 2 and 3 were good too;;
Anthem looks like a 3rd person Destiny to me;;
yeah, 100% agree <@416803598173995018>;;
kelly the only one who liked andromeda;;
ooo boy, that game was bad. So many bugs;;
i dont care about bugs, i want to enjoy overall story and world;;
and i didnt;;
Most bugs arent bad, some can be annoying but yeah I also didnt care about the story at all. Hey <@207416847019016202> I know you dont like Rainbow Six Siege but the Russian team is beating the South American team right now, just like how you beat mango;;
in their pro league I mean;;
whats more important, mango wants russian team to win;;
so basically he wants orange to beat him;;
lol he is picking the right side now;;
he has given up on his country;;
im pretty sure his country US;;
so yeah, you right;;
–†–£–°–°–ö–ò–ï –í–ü–ï–†–ï–î what does this mean? People keep posting it in the chat;;

<:Orange:545555843978887170> `ewww gross`;;
Russia won! They advance and South America goes home;;
to be robbed;;
hahahaha;;
how is crime in russia?;;
–ø—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—É–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ;;
give me context;;
maybe ill give you better word;;
robbery - –æ–≥—Ä–∞–±–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ;;
Yeah I know robbery is kinda big in Brazil, its big here too. Is it bad in Russia?;;
no i dont think so;;
it was huge in 90s;;
crazy time;;
now imo its pretty safe;;
"we have no places like ""if you will go there you will definitely get robbed or killed""";;
Good to know, I thought it was pretty safe there.;;
Oh thats good lol. We have those places here;;
its honestly strange for me;;
90s were russia childhood basically;;
everything fucked up;;
but in US...;;
of course, some people getting robbed or killed here;;
but is not ususal common thing;;
That's good though, it's very common here. Especially in certain parts of cities. Crime is very violent, lot's of gangs and the last few years as you probably know, a lot of shootings;;
fuck its very uncommon for me;;
There are parts of LA that I will never go because I know something bad will happen;;
everyone who survived in 90s, live in peace here now haha;;
thats good though;;
and not a lot survived haha;;
well thats not good lol;;
theres no parts of moscow or any russian city ive been that i would advise never go in;;
of course you dont want to go to random small villages;;
youll find some local unfrienfly folks;;
but thats all;;
I wish it was different here. I dont even like to go to the movie anymore or the bank cause Im afraid of a shooting happening. They are so common here now, its sad;;
why are the folks unfriendly in small villages?;;
i mean, you know;;
all these photos of russian guys;;
sitting;;
in hats;;
lol I actually dont know what you mean;;
wait;;
I don't know either;;
;;
lol ohhhh ok;;
Like this;;
But Sao Paulo has A LOT of places where you don't want to go in;;
why are they bad?;;
Rio too;;
its kinda common look for russian 90-00s local distrinct criminals;;
that would beat and robbed you;;
<@488734758847905803> LA is the same way, maybe not as bad but still pretty bad;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah its basically the entire city lol;;
Adidas and hats;;
*district;;
china adidas of course;;
Yeah <@467974634977886220> and I are always careful when we leave the house;;
Hahaha China Adidas lmao;;
<@416803598173995018> we have never been there, but it seems like it's a safe place, or am I wrong?;;
so these guys kinda extinct now. mainly... but in the small villages... they basically all of citizens <@416803598173995018>;;
maybe i exaggerate;;
ahh ok <@207416847019016202> . I will tell you a story. 3 years ago, I am working security. We had patrol cars and I was responding to a burglary alarm. It was a very bad part of LA, I drove by some gang members and they flashed their gang signs at me etc, next thing I know, I hear a snap and a bullet went through my back window and out the front. It hit the headrest and missed my head by about an inch. I quit shortly after and decided I dont want to be a cop in this city or do security anymore. It wasnt worth it. The people here, not at all but alot hate the police so much and all the gang members want to kill you;;
<@467974634977886220> LA? Most of it yes, just a few spots that are very bad but the crime is limited to that area;;
Most of it is safe I mean;;
just like any city in America;;
to be objective, hows criminality on New York comparing to LA? <@416803598173995018>;;
The story I just said was in one of the bad parts that you shouldnt go lol but for the most part is very nice city.;;
<@416803598173995018> wow that's a crazy story, so glad nothing happened to you!;;
Im not sure <@207416847019016202> NY used to be very, very bad but it has gotten better;;
ok anthem feels good;;
UI is still herrendous though;;
like mega herrendous UI;;
NY in the 70's and 80's and some 90's was very bad with crime;;
<@467974634977886220> yeah me too lol;;
<@160543395037708288> you feel good;;
inside you;;
<:Emote_DONGLE_MASTER_112_00000:543050254157873173>;;
i heard about it being very bad in 80s and such, but dont know about now <@416803598173995018>;;
<@416803598173995018>  damn. you were a cop?;;
I dont think its as bad. My fiance went there a few months ago and she said it was pretty nice. Still some crime but not like it used to be;;
<@455797717763883009> yeah and worked security/executive protection for almost 6 years;;
<@416803598173995018> we visited New Jersey and NY in 2016, and I felt super safe there. Like 100 times more than Sao Paulo;;
yeah I think its pretty good now. Just like LA, overall very safe but some places you just dont go;;
Glad you're fine buddy.;;
Thanks man, got stories for daysssss and I only did it for 6 years lol;;
Dongle jousting here now;;
thank you so much, i will use it against you in the next LA vs NY topic;;
<@416803598173995018> <@467974634977886220>  <@488734758847905803>;;
lol <@207416847019016202> NY and LA are very different cities but both are cool;;
<@467974634977886220>  I've heard worse things about Brasil and Sao Paulo form my Brazilian colleague;;
<@160543395037708288> , does the story really suck though? I'm sad;;
<@207416847019016202> do you have a topic picked out?;;
<@488734758847905803>  what story/;;
im pretty used to live in a city where are no BADLY dangerous districts <@416803598173995018>;;
Oh shit <@416803598173995018> don't die;;
topic - i love NY, how about that <@416803598173995018>;;
Yeah Just a dangerous President <@207416847019016202>;;
The story in anthem <@455797717763883009>;;
really?;;
Didn't see you were still online haha. You can answer that as well master;;
that's awesome  <@207416847019016202> I would love to visit Russia someday;;
Abssii said it was more focused on multiplayer;;

Haven't had any loading screen issues yet;;
Me neither...this is what I was wondering about...It's been  loading screen free so far.  But I had them in the demo.;;
"<@207416847019016202>  NYC and LA used to be bad news, but if you google safest big cities in  America, NYC and LA make the top 20. Philly on the other hand....""While 49% of Americans believe New York to be either fairly unsafe or very unsafe, it actually has a murder rate per 100,000 (5) that is less than one quarter of that in Philadelphia (21.5), the most surprisingly dangerous big city in America.""";;
Its recently gottwn a little better but its not a safe city by any means;;
well after what <@416803598173995018> said its strange to consider LA as safe city for me <@345380744375566338>;;
Most cities have thier bad and good areas. SOme cities bad areas are really really bad;;
<@348165887347523594> anytime you enter or exit a dungeon or a building theres a loading screen;;
theres one in the first mission you do with other players;;
<@207416847019016202> lol it is for the most part, crime can happen anywhere. The only difference, is there are some areas here you want to completely avoid. Theres no reason you should be there in the first place though;;
<@160543395037708288> hooo ok bro...I  see. I see...It was alright for me...My gaming hd is ssd. It wasn't to bothering.  I did get it but I played a lot solo today...just the story;;
Im headed home guys, will streaming today in about an hour or so;;
<@416803598173995018> Ok boooiiiii;;
"well this ""areas you should totally avoid"" thing is pretty unusual for me <@416803598173995018>";;
I'll  do more multi once  I upgrade my javelin a bit more;;
and all these shots;;
ya exactly install on ssd you should have no problems;;
rip console tho;;
üíî;;
Yeah I can understand that <@207416847019016202> I don‚Äôt think many places in the world are like that;;
i wish i streamed before you guys so i can raid all yall like you do with me üò¶ im always the last one on;;
mb;;
slowest one? <@160543395037708288>;;
slowest one?;;
<@207416847019016202>;;
haha forget it <@160543395037708288>;;
so, no story in anthem?;;
not much?;;
<@416803598173995018> fuck im pretty sure i will drop sleeping very soon;;
will not be able to enjoy your voice;;
Sadly. I'm experiencing lags;;
<@160543395037708288> when is your next stream session?;;
hey guys;;
quick questionaroonieville;;
https://teespring.com/chilling-in-the-shade-mug#pid=658&cid=102952&sid=front;;
what do you guys think?;;
is it too small?;;
Make it wrap around;;
I don't know if I can;;
I think it only allows you to do one side;;
Ah;;
well, it lets you do both, but you have to pick a different image or repeat the old one;;
maybe it need to be one big mango cup sized, without background? because this small background imo looks not enough;;
Can you fit it top to bottom?;;
Or just the box;;
?;;
yeah, i agree with <@455797717763883009> , it would be better top to bottom;;
like jonny did basically;;
<@455797717763883009> , it only lets me stretch it diagonally, i can't just stretch it vertically;;
hm;;
fok;;
<@348165887347523594>  you getting connection issues?;;
Just let me play offline üòü;;
I think I'll have to do different sizes;;
damn, it's not letting you play offline <@455797717763883009> ?;;
Yeah  <@488734758847905803> you need to resize the image;;
Nope;;
that  really sucks;;
So much fucking potential;;
gonna have to wait till <@467974634977886220> stops working then;;
cause I know nothing about Photoshop and suhc;;
Ah;;
what do you know? <@488734758847905803> ;;
besides neymar and pele;;
<@455797717763883009> next stream in 2 hours babycakes;;
wait;;
i meant <@409836692158021632>;;
woooops;;
Haha;;
lmao <@207416847019016202> i dont know pele;;
<@488734758847905803> use a png for the image;;
not a jpeg;;
stacy round 2 <@160543395037708288>;;
so with no background;;
it is a png;;
so it can look like the purplemango is on the mug itself;;
yeah but you have a background;;
ah yes;;
makes it look stretched and offput;;
I am going to make a few different mugs;;
just have the purplemango, and then a background color on the mug itself;;
Yeah without the sky and ground;;
I thought the background could look coolio;;
not that no;;
but I'll take your advice;;
lmao;;
im blunt a f sorry;;
but thats my 2 cents;;
I love bluntness;;
ok good baby ‚ù§;;
fucking love it;;
I hate beating around the bush;;
TELL ME THAT YOU HATE ME;;
yeah for real;;
do it;;
do it;;
i dont do small talk either lmao;;
I HATE YOU OKAY;;
jk;;
lmao;;
i hate you, dont thank me <@488734758847905803>;;
won't thank you <@207416847019016202>;;
i'll fill your dongle hole;;
instead;;
thanks for not thanking me <@488734758847905803>;;
<@467974634977886220> used to get mad at me when we first started dating;;
Your loss <@207416847019016202>;;
she would ask if her work was good;;
"and if it wasnt, i'd be like, ""I dont think it's good""";;
she couldnt find dongle? <@488734758847905803>;;
Lmao;;
she'd be like üò≤;;
I feel it's better, because when it is good, I tell her and she actually believes me;;
But you're actually lying;;
Because you want some dongle action;;
üòÄ  <@455797717763883009>;;
hahaahah;;
plot twist;;
I only say that it's not good enough for her not to get smart on my tactics;;
thanks for outing me <@455797717763883009>;;
Super glad to üêº;;
thats one smart panda;;
Now the panda is waiting for serves to connect to;;
Servers;;
Now it asked me to restart Anthem;;

<:Orange:545555843978887170> üçÜ;;
Mango tea, mango sugar and mango baked eggs;;
And he washes them down and drinks Mango tears;;

<:Orange:545555843978887170> `Mango tears is delicious Russian beverage!`;;
i dont actually like mangoes üòÑ;;

Hahaha <@442488674144223242>;;
<@442488674144223242> God damn, your dongle will grow fast here;;
why is that?;;
There are three gods here... The greatest is the Mango god, the second but insolent is the Orange god, and the third but unstoppable and unpalpable the  Dongle god <@442488674144223242>;;
supposedly you are the one whose dongle grows the quickest;;
Not really, actually the two fastest are <@416803598173995018> ...and the Orange;;
hahaha 3 gods! ;;
the Dongle Trinity!;;
In the name of the Mango;;
and of the Orange;;
and of the holy Zorbacles;;
Amen;;
üôè;;
ive only really become active on here the last few days. pretty much lurked until then;;
I'm a bystander ... I'm the ghost spell of what is happening here  and <@409836692158021632>  is the archangel  encouraging  all this;;

i got wonderful raid today with 20+ people, thanks to game i choose (TES Legends);;
Is there a way to play TES legends against you? I'm not good but it would be fun to play a few games. Or another game that is similar;;
<@207416847019016202>;;
Sorry I couldn't stop by  <@207416847019016202> I was completely wrecked this morning;;
its okay <@498246547838992414>;;
i think there is way, in left lower corner of TES legends is friend list, i got no friends there so i dont know how it works. add me there, my bethesda net name is septorus <@345380744375566338>;;
Am I dead to you as well?;;
no, you had immunity <@498246547838992414>;;

lmao Sorry <@207416847019016202> !;;
I stilll love you;;
I will drop some mad bitties on your chest!;;
On his dongle*;;
if you want to go nasty and do 69 bits, than <@409836692158021632>  already did it, so i suggest something like 666999 <@488734758847905803>;;
oof  <@207416847019016202>;;
or 694206942069;;
lmao;;
I'll do my best to reach that number someday <@207416847019016202>;;
that number you mean 69? <@488734758847905803>;;
yeah, you need to be flexible to do it;;
I mean 6669999;;
That's a big number;;
yeah;;
3 people + 4 people;;
fuck, thanks to raid i ALMOST got it;;
it was just a momentary;;
uuuuuu;;
so close;;
tes legends has drops system, when you get something in-game for just watching streams;;
ah true;;
league of legends has that as well;;
i almost always lurk someone who playing tes legends;;
so, playing that game basically gives you army of lurkers;;
Ho boy ho boy;;
I want to get back to sleep;;
But these freaking clients took all that goodness out of me;;
lmao;;
<@207416847019016202> it was good stream. Very impressive you had so many viewers, very awesome! Good morning all;;
haha thanks <@416803598173995018>;;
as i said, pick the right game - receive lurkers army;;
guy who raided me said he looked for somebody who played it;;
true that;;
That‚Äôs awesome <@207416847019016202>;;
Evening fellas üêº;;
Day 1 and you've hit almost 50 already. Nice  <@207416847019016202>;;
beginners luck <@455797717763883009>;;
just for curiousity... how much 100 bits costs for you in your money? <@455797717763883009>  <@416803598173995018>  <@488734758847905803>;;
without considering minimum wage lol <@488734758847905803>;;
because for me its 1,66 bucks;;
Which currency is bucks! <@207416847019016202>;;
USD i meant;;
or what is your question means? <@455797717763883009>;;
It's 5.7‚Ç¨ for 500 bits;;
So close to 1.1 for 100 bits;;
you dont have option for 100? <@455797717763883009>;;
Okay, 500 is 7,08 euro here;;
as always, everything fucking more expensive;;
oh i hate this country;;
i dont really get how this works;;
oh, you got salaries several times less than in europe? come here, check out these HUGE prices!;;
100 bits = 6 BRL;;
lmao <@207416847019016202> yeah same;;
oh why cant everyone say it right away in USD;;
ok, 1,62 dollars;;
well i can understand why;;
Hahaha;;
in russia we have very low income tax for citizens;;
13%;;
but it compensates by other taxes;;
that are always included in product costs, as a result;;
so if you re twitch and you going to russia to sell your stuff, you need to pay this 20% tax;;
or something like this;;
and you just include it in price;;
so russians would pay it;;
i think thats the reason in this case;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> I hate Russian taxes;;
haha;;
im pretty sure it made for rich people;;
i mean its better for rich;;
I downloaded TES legends. Lets play in the future;;
i can now if you want, but without voice;;
with voice - tomorrow in the morning - noon;;

Very quiet today, how are you all?;;
Hey  <@348165887347523594>;;
Quiet day indeed;;
We had a lot of dongle talk yesterday;;
yeah, it was dongle day;;
i feel kinda sick all day, i think i got flu or something;;
so my body on low power mode;;
playing through the intro;;
oh good;;
intro is very good explained imo;;
I just fell down the fooking stairs lol;;
wow;;
are you still in one piece?;;
Barely;;
He wouldn't be on the phone otherwise  <@207416847019016202> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
damn;;
you're alright man?;;
So... I'm incredibly stupid;;
<@498246547838992414> reset your save point;;
<@207416847019016202> You're taking some medications brother?;;
So I'm walking down the stairs like normal right, and I forget that there's 1 more stair, and I just flop forwards, and bash my face against the wall;;
I wish lol  <@455797717763883009>;;
you need only hands to use phone <@455797717763883009>;;
Today honestly felt like I needed a real day off video games....Like i've been playing way too much lately...not only that...watching and talking only video games...I had to shut it down for a bit;;
<@348165887347523594> yeah, kinda some basic stuff, to not get worse;;
Damnn;;
<@207416847019016202> I hope so bro...take good care of you;;
yeah thanks <@348165887347523594>;;
i want to stream tomorrow but im not sure how i will feel;;
Oof  <@207416847019016202> don't be a sick orange, now;;
You can take tomorrow off <@207416847019016202>;;
And we can just hang out here;;
im always a SICK ORANGE <@498246547838992414> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
I've been saying that we should do a movie thing one day...like getting on sync on a movie and hang out on the chat channel;;
Yeah  <@348165887347523594>;;
Rabbit?;;
And hang out on vc?;;
<@455797717763883009> I think it'd be a good thing;;
Any movie on Netflix or Amazon Prime;;
Yeah it'll be fun;;
<@488734758847905803> get on it;;
what's vc <@498246547838992414> ?;;
<@348165887347523594> Voice Chat;;
Voice chat;;
<@498246547838992414> Yeah;;
We could do that once a while;;
Yey;;
Once <@488734758847905803> shows up, if I'm not here...talk to him about it;;
I'll try to remember  <@348165887347523594>;;
I'll be up for a while;;
<@455797717763883009> I haven't got Amazon prime, but netflix...should be good;;
Netflix is cool;;
<@498246547838992414> Me too, I'll be here for a while too;;
Yeah Netflix is cool;;
I'm looking forward to that;;
I'll be playing games and watching streams all night;;
Maybe I won't even sleep;;
Smuggle some food into my room;;
Set up a tent;;
I don't know about games....last week I've only done that...playing watching people play...talking about games...I need a break;;
Smells like a plan to me!!;;
<@348165887347523594> Yeah, sometimes it can be overwhelming;;
But videogames are all that I have rn, sooooo;;
Oh yeah the movie thing is awesome!;;
We can do it with womango too;;
Hey  <@488734758847905803>!!!;;
Hey <@498246547838992414>;;
You beautiful waffle;;
(cause you're Belgian );;
<@498246547838992414> Yep, and I admit that choosing the wrong javelin ruined my mood for freaking real...played like a beast to change it...I'm so tired of it;;
*RACIST*;;
I added you <@207416847019016202>;;
<@488734758847905803> Super man...we should try to plan this one day;;
When timezones stop being assholes  <@348165887347523594>;;
haha;;
Haha;;
In a few months you guys  (Europeans) will be 4 hours ahead of.me;;
Dude, this is one thing I hate about games as services...you can't go back and you got to grind to fix shit;;
Yeah that really freaking sucks;;
Though I used to hate Pokemon because of that too;;
The fact that I chose the wrong Javelin ruined it all for me;;
You could only have 1 game on your cartridge;;
But;;
Couldn't you go back to a previous save?;;
<@488734758847905803> There are no save bro;;
Aaaaaahhh;;
its online game, i cant see how there would be saves;;
God dammit;;
I should be close to get the necessary level but I played so much to get it back yesterday that I'm kind of disgustted;;
I freaking nearly fell again;;
I stood up too quick;;
you just love it <@498246547838992414>;;
No saves?!;;
I love breaking myself  <@207416847019016202>;;
<@498246547838992414> is like my spirit animal;;
He falls all the time and is clumsy af;;
lmao;;
i mean, its normal to assume that it all autosaves <@488734758847905803>;;
with no going back;;
Why?;;
There are plenty of games that don't do that;;
Normally I'm not clumsy at all, but today is just hard for me to exist in general  <@488734758847905803>;;
I mean, they should at least ask if you're sure what javelin you want;;
did you play ANY game that can be considered as game service??? <@488734758847905803>;;
Game as services usually don't give that option <@488734758847905803>;;
exactly <@348165887347523594>;;
Hm;;
Like the fact that you can't pause;;
yeah;;
Well, games like destiny and stuff they ask you if you're sure that you chose the right thing;;
Or if that's not the case, you can just start a new game easily;;
well they still dont allow you to load other save <@488734758847905803>;;
i think;;
That's it, I'm not gonna get out of bed out of fear that I break something, MY WATER BOTTLE WILL BE MY TOILET;;
dont you afraid that bed will break you? <@498246547838992414>;;
It did not...it did warn before chosing <@488734758847905803> ...but on one click I did this freaking mistake;;
Omg, true  <@207416847019016202>;;
;;
I'll grab duct tape, and tape myself to the floor, so I can't move and break something;;
<@498246547838992414> Glassdate;;
OMGGG  <@351676358864142336>, Welcome under the shade of the mango tree dude!!!;;

Hey hey!! That's a welcome! üòÑ;;
<@348165887347523594> which Javelin did you go for?;;
Storm;;
I hate it;;
Welcome  <@351676358864142336>!;;
Oh wow. I went for the interceptor;;
JK! <@351676358864142336> is amazing people and we are honored to have him here!;;
(Seriously, you're too good to be here man! Leave now while you can!);;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Ooooh, Anthem....I'm starting it tomorrow! Any tips?;;
welcome <@351676358864142336> ;;
mute this server from now on, or you will hate your life, reading all this shit;;
I feel so uncomfortable with it . I wanted the ranger...but the damn game did not even give me a confirmation warning;;
Lol  <@207416847019016202><:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
The general chat is nothing but pain  <@351676358864142336>;;
Yeah even I think the ranger would've been a better option.;;
But seriously, guys. <@351676358864142336> is an amazing person. ;;
Thanks for being here, sir. ;;
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§;;
<@351676358864142336> Just make sure you take your time when you choose your Javelin;;
emoji competition;;
Also the flying is awesome  <@351676358864142336>;;
Just have fun with that;;
Thank you all for the welcome, and thank you <@348165887347523594> for the advice! I briefly played the demo, but I can't wait to get in to it properly.;;
Getting to level 8 isn't that hard...but when using a javelin that you simply hate makes it not fun at all;;
did you finished trial? <@455797717763883009> ;;
will you buy it?;;
How much is anthem actually?;;
I'm trying to not spend my life savings;;
isn't it 60 euros?;;
Are you console or PC <@!498246547838992414>;;
Pc  <@351676358864142336>;;
Yeah it's 60‚Ç¨;;
And it's included in origin premier;;
I'm on Xbox;;
60 isn't bad tbh;;
I'm still in two minds.;;
Because the trial is laggy af sometimes;;
I'll drop it if I like what I see;;
I'm on console for the time being, I'll be on Xbox with it from tomorrow with the trial;;
Yeah just try it <@!498246547838992414>;;
üëÄ;;
<@351676358864142336> Yeah, let us know what you think of it;;
Yeah just try the trial with Access;;
I'm gonna play Mirrors edge and Unravel 2. So worth the 4 bucks;;
Will do!;;
<@287320205020102667> Them thicc eyes are making my dongle wobble;;
<@287320205020102667> I'd tap them eyes all week long baby;;
Haha hey <@348165887347523594> how‚Äôs your day going;;
Oh snap! Lol;;
<@287320205020102667> good my man...how has been yours? it's 5pm here;;
It‚Äôs 3pm here and I haven‚Äôt done a damn thing but lay around lol;;
I just went get me some good. I‚Äôm gonna clean and organize a little bit to be somewhat productive and then I‚Äôll hop on the game;;
Me too...I brought my father to the airport this morning...then got back home...Then put myself to bed....I've been in a bad mood because of anthem the whole day;;
What‚Äôs wrong with anthem;;
It's good, just that I chose a javelin that I hate...and it's ruining it for me...I should be able to get to level 8 and change javelin pretty soon...But I had enough playing with this stupid javelin....it's no fun;;
How much is anthem and what platform are you playing it on;;
It's 60 euros..probably 60 dollars too(so cheaper for you)...and I had it included with origin access;;
Are you on pc;;
Or PS4;;
Pc;;
For Anthem, I'm on Pc right now;;
Other than that I'm on pc, ps4 and xbox;;
What ya play on PS4;;
I haven't got much on ps4 yet...only solo player games...The only mp game I got on it is Apex Legends;;
I got my ps4 just for all the exclusives initially...when god of war came out;;
<@287320205020102667> I also have fortnite but I can't get into it.;;
Awe bummer I like that game;;

Haha;;
I just got the ranger. I grinded like crazy for about an hour;;
I hated the storm. It has it's own abilities and you may like it. For me, it took away the fun. I like shooting things;;
Ranger is the best choice as first javelin;;
I went for the interceptor because it looked cool in the trailer;;
But yeah, the first mission as a ranger was nice;;
I wouldn't change it;;
So you like the interceptor?;;
And some one get Iron Man game rolling;;
I never got the chance to play with it properly. Because of the lag;;
which one you like better? the ranger or the interceptor?;;
Ranger for sure;;
Right now after having tried the colossus, ranger, interceptor, I will stick to the ranger;;
Yeah....the ranger is just great for doing everything.;;
Interceptor was cool, but ranger felt more good;;
Yeah overall;;
<@488734758847905803> did you notice that me and you are only one who is not talented here?;;
Did <@361554595354509312> says which one he like the most?;;
Not sure;;
<@207416847019016202> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
<@207416847019016202> You are not one of the most popular here for nothing. Talented boy;;
Are you still undecisive about buying it <@455797717763883009> ?;;
Yes I am a bit. I checked few videos on the previous demo. And I seem to have the same issue;;
My character keeps going back to the same spot;;
And I'm not able to move forward;;
Maybe because it's trial and they don't give a fuck maybe? <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
I had this issue with the demo....like a lot...it's game breaking...but not since the last built...It's internet related. Have you check if you aren't downloading anything while playing?;;
Nothing. Everything else was fine;;
Saw a Reddit thread on it too;;
It's servers;;
damn..I thought it was only me and it was due to my fucked up internet access;;
It's not doing it right now;;
I have a pretty decent internet here;;
I would've told you to try a vpn;;
But Xbox;;
It's not about your internet really, it's about the server;;
I'm gonna give it a shot by using my mobile data as hotspot;;
I use express vpn when I'm about to go online;;
On my xbox and ps4;;
I really like the environment and how the Javelin controls;;
Oh;;
On my pc I use speedify;;
How do you do it on the console?;;
Abssii uses expressvpn as well...and his streams are a whole lot easier for people like me;;
Interesting, I will check it out. Thanks  <@348165887347523594>;;
Expressvpn is configurable on xbox or ps4 or pc;;
But it's like 12 dollars üò¶;;
Does it have a trial period? üòÇ;;
Living on trials;;
No...not expressvpn...no trial..but it's the best out there...they don't give a fuck;;
12 dollars if you want to get it for a month...then..if you take a longer subscription, it's 8 I think...so yeah...that sucks...but like I said..it's the best vpn outhere the fastest... and they don't care;;
Hmm I will see how it works for me. Because I barely do online gaming;;
ok...I was just saying....So you know üòâ;;
Haha yes. Will wait for the reviews for drop;;
Because it looks like I won't be able to do anything with the 8 more hours left in my trial;;
I'm not using expressvpn just for game though...overall it just gives me a beter access to everything;;
Ah, I don't have issues generally;;
Even for piracy;;
Italians don't give a fuck;;
There are lots of region blocks here...The goverment says that they are trying to fix it...but we are struggling with all kinds of region blocks...so the vpn makes everything available;;
Yeah, I got yu;;
Ah region blocks;;
That sucks;;
Yeah,sucks...cause we have all the rights to go over all the internet but Martinique is not listed into a lot of proxys;;
Ah;;
It's a very very small island...even though it is France...we have those issues;;
That's bad;;
At least you're on an island;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
hahaha;;
hope everyone is having a good weekend;;
Yeah...and I have the solutions...I use vpns, and all these 4g boxes I spoke about before...so I don't really feel the limitations.<@455797717763883009>;;
Good here <@311684705810513921> , hope yours is wonderfull;;
But most people here won't go as far as I am;;
Yeah looks like you've got it sorted <@348165887347523594>;;
Most people anywhere won't;;
I just hope the issues are because of the traffic;;
Maybe it'll be better later down;;
haha....I think that most people moving from a place that had great access to a place with limited access would try;;
Yeah, i'm sure it will üòâ;;
In Palm beach I didn't have any of these issues;;
Lol. If I'm moving to an island. I'll be happy with an offline game and then some beers by the beach;;
lmao...I'm happy with that too;;
How‚Äôs everyone doing?;;

I don‚Äôt think many did. Fortnite is still pretty strong;;
"Well that's good. When these new br games come out. It's amazing how they try to label something as a ""fortnite killer"" almost like when a new mmo comes out to be a ""wow killer""";;
Yeh lol;;
They keep flooding the market with these battle royale games and people will get sick of them;;
"I at least try to give some a try. But my issue is when I see a br game and I go ""hey that will be fun to stream"" then I see everyone single big streamer on it and it's kinda like üòÖ üòÖ";;
Never mind;;

also getting back into my writing streams again;;
dongle dance woo;;
#unleashthemango;;
true that <@311684705810513921> ;;
just a matter of sitting down and doing it;;
#unleashthemango;;
I forgot about that hashtag;;
<@207416847019016202> - <@467974634977886220> made it, but only <@278571432588345345> can use it;;
because he has discord nitro;;
lol;;
Yep, i'm bad at focus lol;;
I'm more like George R.R Martin and need to be more like Steven King;;
i knew she loves somebody more than you <@488734758847905803>;;
*oof*;;
Wassup chat;;
lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
hahaha dont be like stephen king <@311684705810513921>;;
his books only have 1 good character - when he writes himself;;
only I can fully unleash the mango;;
an alcoholic writer;;
lmao <@278571432588345345> yeah;;
hey <@345984543246909442> !;;
what's up dude?;;
How you been bro <@488734758847905803>;;
<@488734758847905803> more like the amount of writing he does... I like his books, but yes some of his stories aren't the best character wise;;
only you decide when I go #fullmango <@278571432588345345>;;
I've been good dude, hbu <@345984543246909442> ?;;
<@311684705810513921> ;;
i am not a big fan of his work.;;
the ones I read had good ideas imo, but since he doesnt seem to think the plots through, there are always some absurd explanations and dialogue;;
It had some of the most fucked up shit;;
The Shining had some bad dialogue and explanations as well;;
Been ok bro;;
what hav eyou been playing / streaming <@345984543246909442> ?;;
but I get waht you mean about focus of course <@311684705810513921>;;
I think some issues stem from all of his books being in the same universe and having connections to everything he has written.;;
"The explanation can be washed by ""it's from another world"" or something like that";;
meh. I don't buy it;;
that turtle business is bs;;
from IT;;
did you read IT/;;
there's a scene in the end that I found to be so ridiculous it would hav emade me stop reading had it been anywhere else in the book;;
Lately I been streaming madden;;
But right now I‚Äôm streaming BO4;;
I‚Äôm taking like a 30 min break I‚Äôm eating & feeding my son also;;
true that;;
post it in <#494741950575149056>;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah, I know what you're talking about... it's a bit... odd. Then again I think IT was doing his cocaine days;;
yeah it was def during his cocaine days <@311684705810513921>;;
he doesnt even remember writing it lol;;
What do you think of his son, Joe Hill?;;
never read  his stuff;;
Horns is one of his;;
I enjoyed the movie, need to read the book;;
Morning everyone;;
true that <@311684705810513921> ;;

I‚Äôm alright I feel like someone beat me in my sleep I think it was the catüòÇ lol I‚Äôm so sore from being in the hospital and the cat likes to lay on me in my sleep. How‚Äôre you? <@311684705810513921>;;
it is here in Brazil <@311684705810513921>;;
oh damn <@524820041976250368> haha;;
<@488734758847905803> lucky! I want to watch it again.. I think I own it though;;
<@524820041976250368> I am doing pretty good. About to be off work so even better!;;
Though I think your cat may be trying to kill you in your sleep;;
lmao;;
Yeah lmao <@488734758847905803> and haha it‚Äôs not actually my cat so I wouldn‚Äôt doubt it he can be a ass <@311684705810513921> and that‚Äôs awesome! I hope you‚Äôre day is going well!!;;
so far so good;;
That‚Äôs good! I actually just woke up lol;;
lucky;;
lol;;
Lol it‚Äôs only 10am here haha;;
Same, but i've been up since 430am;;
I didn‚Äôt go to bed until a lil after that haha plus I kept waking up trying to respond to everyone and well needless to say I kept dropping my phone cause I was too weak to type so I gave up üòÇ;;
haha;;
did you drop it on your face though?;;
and sleep! the conversation will be here when you wake up;;
Yes sadly multiple times. And I don‚Äôt like to get behind on everything it‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt typically sleep haha;;
lol;;
you wont get behind and sacrificing sleep isn't good for you üòõ;;
But I walk away for a second and there‚Äôs usually over 50 messages so imagine sleeping that number grows tremendously üòÇ;;
"I'm in over 20 discords. I miss a lot of conversation, but that's ok... because I can just jump in when I can. Don't worry about what you ""miss"" because we will always be here and won't forget about you if you sleep";;
I‚Äôm only in 13 but I only tend to keep up with 4 of them. Haha 4 of the best onesüíú I absolutely love being in this one;;
Hello mangos. I hope everyone one is having a nice day .;;
Kelly! I hope you‚Äôre having a good day!;;

I haven‚Äôt been chatting much either <@524820041976250368> ive met a really nice woman and been trying to get my life straight before I go to far and waste time;;
That‚Äôs understandable. I hope it works out for you! I‚Äôve pretty much been single all my life but 6 months. Haha. I‚Äôm more the type to try to get people together and the observer type and advice giver üòÇüòÇ;;
<@448648678224429068>;;
lol i'm the opposite <@524820041976250368>;;
most of my life I was in a relationship or another;;
since I was 14 basically;;
Haha really? <@488734758847905803>;;
I dated a girl for 3 years from 14 to 17;;
then I was single for about 6 months;;
dated a girl for 2 years;;
Yeah I‚Äôve went through a rough time but I‚Äôm hoping this helps me come out of the spell;;
then anotehr for 1 year;;
then womango and i started dating;;
but we have known each other since we were 14;;
it will <@448648678224429068>;;
if it's not this girl, it will be another;;
I didn‚Äôt date until I was 21 and lasted for 6 months before I gave up I don‚Äôt give up easily tho. And then back to the single life haha. <@488734758847905803> and <@448648678224429068> I‚Äôm sorry you went through a rough time I hope this is the one and you don‚Äôt have to go thru anymore pain. But just know that each failed relationship will lead you to the best one of your life, keep holding on you got this!;;
haha are you sure it works this way? <@524820041976250368>;;
We talking about dating?;;
i think yeah;;
Well then, I'm not much help then;;
It‚Äôs what I believe lol but I don‚Äôt really date (not my choice). Just trying to be positive for him, <@207416847019016202> and why‚Äôs that? <@498246547838992414>;;
Meh, love ain't for me for now;;
Still getting over my past gf;;
That‚Äôs understandable sorry to hear thatüíú;;
Alrighty I‚Äôll brb;;
Ah, no problem <@524820041976250368>, this happens, we're still friends and all, it just didn't work out;;
Lol you all are the best;;
"hey what do you mean ""not my choice"" <@524820041976250368> ";;
nobody wants to date you? thats not the world i want to live in;;
lets find you somebody;;
we got young belgian here for example;;

Sorry, I'm not with it this weekend;;

lmfao;;
XD;;
<@488734758847905803> let  <@467974634977886220> take over;;

Then orange is happy I think;;
yeah;;
orange doesnt even care about having the orange  tree;;
all he wants is to kill the mango tree;;
Yeah, *scorched mango tree*;;
Aww it happens like that sometimes, but proud of you for still staying friends not many people can do that cause the pain over takes <@498246547838992414> and <@207416847019016202> I‚Äôve been trying to date someone I like for over a year and well it‚Äôs complicated. And <@467974634977886220> not many do believe it, but it is true, some find the one early on and some don‚Äôt it happens just gotta keep pushing forward!;;
How does one find love when said person is a fugly bastard?;;
Asking for a friend here;;
<@498246547838992414> are you talking about <:Orange:545555843978887170> ?;;
XD;;
<@488734758847905803> i believe you have a community that‚Äôs got a lot in common with one another and I must say it‚Äôs amazing being able to just freely talk and be comfortable with everyone in hereüíú;;
Exactly that  <@524820041976250368>, I'm normally a really closed person, but I've shared my feelings here, more than in real life lol;;
Yeah you called Orange a fugly bastard;;
Lmao  <@455797717763883009>;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>  rageee;;
T'was I who I was talking about;;
Same here <@498246547838992414> I usually keep to myself but feel comfortable with all of you so it‚Äôs easier for me to talk;;
Yeah, I love how supportive everyone here is;;
I would've been a whole different person if not for mango;;
On a serious note. I would say, just go with the flow on what makes you happy. And not to dwell too much with the past.;;
I agree  <@455797717763883009>;;
If you do so you can grow to 1.8 <:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840>;;
"oh i laughed so much when you said ""he loves a good waffle"" <@488734758847905803> ";;
"we have waffles in russia, but aside from food it also has slang dirty meaning, like ""to waffle"" = ""to give blowjob""";;
Agreed <@498246547838992414>;;
And üòÇüòÇüòÇ <@207416847019016202>;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Waffle can also mean a hard slap, as a slang word here;;

<@455797717763883009> Yes I am....I've just played almost 5 hours of game with no issues;;
Playing on hard can be extremely challenging. I was playing with <@278571432588345345> and another friend and we struggled to pass that one mission. Took us something like 10 retries and lots of strategy;;
Yeah;;
Good times;;
That‚Äôs good! <@348165887347523594>;;

Hey! <@409836692158021632> !!;;
Thanks..I'm pretty much used to it..just need to rest my head at a certain angle.. but I'm okay now..;;
How are you <@409836692158021632> ?;;
Go to sleep <@207416847019016202> .. <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
no, its okay for me;;
i go to sleep somewhere from 3 to 5, and wake up at 9-10;;
5-6 hours is ok for me;;
True.. 5-6hrs is okay;;
Lmao that was my bad about the dating talküòÇ and I‚Äôm doing alright! <@526319824704634881> how‚Äôre you?;;
that's alright, it's just that dating is not my thing too.. lol;;
I'm okay..just prowering through work. ;;
Not sleepy <@524820041976250368> ?;;
I understand that same here. I mean I‚Äôd love to but just not in my goals as of right now. Haha. Nope not sleepy actually energized. How long til you get off work? <@526319824704634881>;;
9yrs down the drain..so I'm pretty much done with dating/relationships. Lol.. ;;
It's late there too right? On your side of the world?;;
7 more hours..sadly..;;
Oh wow, sorry to hear that! But totally understand. Don‚Äôt give up hope tho the right one will find you and when they do you will know it, And it‚Äôs currently 6:49pm;;
Just focusing on myself and my health for now...actually, being single is not bad at all.. ;;
Oh it's still early.. sorry, I'm never good at remembering timezones.. so basically I'm 14 hrs ahead.. wow..;;
It‚Äôs not actually, it allows you to focus on you and that‚Äôs what I love about being single. Not that being in a relationship is a bad thing it‚Äôs just you get to know yourself better when you can focus on you! And omg wow didn‚Äôt know that! Where you live at? I‚Äôm not so good with time zones either haha;;
Agreeee..;;
I live in Mordor.. kidding;;
Philippines..;;
How are you guys;;
Hey <@348165887347523594> !;;
Oh okay cool! <@526319824704634881> and I‚Äôm doing alright! How‚Äôre you? <@348165887347523594>;;
I'm glad Anthem finally worked for you <@348165887347523594>.;;
I'm fine..still anxious for tomorrow...I just got out of a long long Anthem session. Like so long that I feel weird lol;;
<@526319824704634881> thanks..it's been very fun;;
Hahahhah.. it got weird? in what way?;;
What‚Äôs tomorrow? <@348165887347523594>;;
Never happened to you to play a game for such a long time that you have a hard time getting back to reality? this is it lol;;
<@524820041976250368> I'm taking the plane for Florida tomorrow morning;;
I haven't even started packing;;
Oh yeah! Plane rides are fun!;;
Oh..that's not weird for me.. that's the main reason I play to escape reality.. lol;;
I‚Äôve never been to Florida yet tho, maybe one day;;
Cool! That's exciting <@348165887347523594>.. but I understand the anxiety of travelling..;;
<@526319824704634881> True true, this is what I've been doing to avoid thinking about tomorrow. But I need to start focusing on the things I need to do before living. I'm pretty much not going to sleep tonight;;
<@524820041976250368> I don't really like traveling. I wish I could just teleport;;
<@526319824704634881> Yeah, and it wasn't planned. I decided to make the trip Saturday morning.;;
Haha I wish I could too! But I love traveling more;;
Impromtu travels are sometimes best..so there's no anxiety build up..;;
<@524820041976250368> I just don't like airports or planes in general.;;
Do you like traveling by car? <@348165887347523594>;;
I developed a very high  fear of car or plane doesn't matter what. I'm scarred of a lot of things.;;
I bought a big car just to have the courage to drive;;
Mordor = Philippines, same ish <:Orange:545555843978887170>üòÇ;;
<@409836692158021632> üòÖ;;
Right?!! <@409836692158021632> üòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
I understand that, I hope for safe travels tomorrow and that you don‚Äôt get too scared! <@348165887347523594>;;
You can do it <@348165887347523594> !! Is it a long plane ride?;;
Thanks <@524820041976250368>;;
üòÇ <@526319824704634881>;;
No problem! <@348165887347523594> üíú;;
<@526319824704634881> The flight should not be long normally. The problem is that there are no direct flights right now. It's a two stop trip;;
So it gets long for nothing;;
Wow <@526319824704634881> 9 yrs down the drain? So sorry to hear that. ;;
Mine was 6 yrs I think...;;
I don't even want to hear about dating. I'm getting too old for those heart breaking things;;
Exactly <@348165887347523594>;;
Oh damn..well..just think that the stop is a breather before the next flight..;;
Some time it sucks when all your friends are in couple but not you. But fuck it, It tends to wreck my life and I don't want to live trough this again.;;
Yeah.. I'm getting too old for dating too <@348165887347523594>;;
When you're alone for a while, you're just like...damn why was I so hurt?;;
<@526319824704634881> Yeah, with age, I think that it hurts even more each time;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> Orange has no heart. No heart = no hurt! Play TES legends!;;
<@409836692158021632> hahaha.;;
Been single for more than 2 yrs now.. it's kinda cool to focus on myself for once..;;
I can sense the scars are deep there <@348165887347523594>... I'm sorry..;;
Lmao <@409836692158021632>;;
One year for me...And I'm just starting to feel myself again. I had to take a break from everyone though. Since she is all around  my friends.;;
Damn, I'm going to start packing in about 2 hours...and just chill right here for now;;
Damn that's difficult..;;
I'm lucky that we have only a few friends in common..but we're civil now.. but I want to punch his face once for cheating.. ahhahahha..;;
üòÇ üòÇ;;
My last relation was a train wreck...I try to avoid crossing her path. I don't want to see her even from afar;;
I‚Äôd never hurt you <@348165887347523594>;;
Everytime I travel I always have my headphones on..could help with the anxiety <@348165887347523594> .. or play mobile games.. or sleep on the plane..;;
<@416803598173995018> thank you my love üíú;;
You shouldve glued his dongle to his stomach üòÇ Just saying  <@526319824704634881>;;
<@526319824704634881> Yeah, I'm making sure that my extra phone batterie is charged before leaving tomorrow;;
<@524820041976250368> üòÇ;;
I just hurt people in apex lol. Up to 80 kills now. For reals though, being single is good and being in a relationship is good. Don‚Äôt ever look for something cause then you settle for what you think is right. The right person comes along when they are supposed to. At least that‚Äôs what I think about my relationship now lol. I could be totally wrong haha;;
Omg <@524820041976250368> ! I should have!;;
Bet he‚Äôd learn not to cheat againüòÇ <@526319824704634881> and <@348165887347523594> üòÇ;;
I did the thing to never do even though I knew I should've never done it ...I went on her phone one day...and the things that I've seen have disgusted me till this day from any kind of sex related talk  It was that bad;;
<@416803598173995018> I think that you re are right buddy.;;
80kills?! Damn pro <@416803598173995018>!!;;
<@416803598173995018> is a beast at those games really;;
Teach me your ways <@416803598173995018> !;;
Wow I come back and there is still dating talk going on lmao;;
Oh shit @kellyd! I did the same thing! Found stuff on his phone too.. the fucking asshole wasn't even sorry..;;
<@448648678224429068> lol, sometime it feels good venting haha;;
Lol I‚Äôm trying! Yeah <@348165887347523594> my fianc√© and I met at the perfect time in our lives. We needed each other at that time and been great ever since;;
Apologies <@448648678224429068>;;
83 kills now <@526319824704634881> lol. I just got 3 more;;
My bad <@448648678224429068>;;
<@348165887347523594> I was with the same woman for 10 years and caught her cheating last year we have 3 kids together so it is hard to get over that stuff but I finally did it this weekend and got into a relationship with an amazing woman;;
And that‚Äôs fantastic to hear! <@416803598173995018>;;
<@526319824704634881> Well, she wasn't either. The girl was making live videos for some dude on fb messenger...Then I learned she was popular at the swinger club...I mean god damn this thing wrecked the hell out of me;;
Happy for you and your fiance <@416803598173995018> !!;;
<@448648678224429068> Ho man, this give me hope....nice to hear that you found  another relation ship. It most have been so hard to deal with this;;
Damn.. I've been playing apex for quite sometime and I only got 18kills  with bloodhound..;;
<@526319824704634881> You're doing much better than I;;
Thanks all! Hasn‚Äôt been all easy, we have been through hard times but they have only made us stronger;;
"I met <@207416847019016202> through ""Bitter Russian Singles Dot Com"" and I've never been saltier in my life.";;
<@348165887347523594> definitely bro but if you give it time something much better will come;;
Good job <@!448648678224429068>, your dongle just grew to 15!;;

Omg! That's bad <@348165887347523594> .. damn.. sorry dude..;;
<@526319824704634881> yep...I tend not to tell  more people down here about it since everyone knows...I felt the shame to be this blind until this day. And Martinique is a small place.;;
Okay.. <@416803598173995018> you're just bragging now.. <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> ;;
Kidding.. ;;

I don't know how you do it <@416803598173995018>;;
Hahahaha I kinda am but I‚Äôm pumped up with adrenaline! Lol;;
Years of playing FPS lol;;
It‚Äôs all about movement in this game I‚Äôve noticed;;
<@416803598173995018> Too bad I won't have anything to game with while this trip. I just hope I'll be able to connect to discord and even twitch sometimes.;;
Who cares what everyone else thinks?..you did nothing wrong.. she should be ashamed not you <@348165887347523594> ..;;
Good job <@!526319824704634881>, your dongle just grew to 7!;;

Yeah not gaming hurts lol but I hope you have a good trip! <@348165887347523594>;;
I main wraith <@526319824704634881>;;
<@526319824704634881> I know, what worked is just letting go of those people and focus on my work and this community.;;
<@416803598173995018> Thanks man, I sure hope it goes well üòâ;;
<@348165887347523594> just keep your head up;;
<@348165887347523594> Yes! This community is awesome.. ;;
I don't usually talk about this stuff, but I feel safe here for some reason..;;
<@526319824704634881> we are a community that‚Äôs what we do is help each other;;
<@416803598173995018> I don't know how to use wraith..stream more and I'll study your ways.. lol;;
What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs favorite song?;;
Yeah, I love it here;;
My world by seckond chance <@524820041976250368>;;
Agree.. awesome community <@448648678224429068> ! Thanks @everyone;;
Wraith is fun lol. Damnit I just had a 7 kill game but I only had 1 teammate and we lost to the final team;;
Omg yes! <@448648678224429068> love that song!;;
That is my song for my kids;;
Soul to squeeze by Red Hot Chili Peppers is my favorite song I think. Really tough to choose though;;
That's a difficult question <@524820041976250368> ... Hmmmmm;;
There a loot..but maybe Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen..;;
<@524820041976250368> I don't think I have one...Or maybe Unchained Melody if there is one.;;
I like old classic slow songs;;
I love One Step Closer by Linkin Park.. Enter Sandman by Metallica as well..;;
Depends on my mood really..;;
How about you <@524820041976250368> ?;;
I almost never listen to music. When ever I listen to something on the radio or pc, it's more nature sounds or podcast or just talkshows.;;
Sometimes I've just put on <@207416847019016202> 's stream on just to fall asleep üòÇ üòÇ <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Lol I think I‚Äôd die without music;;
I'm the opposite <@348165887347523594>.. I can't survive not listening to music, especially while working.. I'm listening to Toxicity rn.. lol;;
System of a Down? <@526319824704634881>;;
Yes;;
I like you! lol I love them;;
Hahahahah!!;;
Imma have to listen to that! <@416803598173995018> and <@526319824704634881> I think I‚Äôve heard that one but imma listen to it! <@348165887347523594> there is nothing wrong with that! And I like that one too! <@416803598173995018> I would die without music too!;;
I should though, I use to listen to lot of music...don't know when and how I stopped. Now when I'm in the car I usually have some audio books on my phone for background listening ...or I tune in to some intellectual bs talkshow;;
<@524820041976250368> soul to squeeze puts me in a good mood whenever I listen to it. It‚Äôs definitely my favorite RHCP song, maybe not favorite song ever. That‚Äôs really tough to narrow down lol. I like a lot of music;;
They are awesome! But all I know are their popular songs.. Chop Suey, Toxicity and Aerials..;;
And mine is picture by Sheryl crow, cookie by r kelly, and wifin you by Montana of 300 <@526319824704634881>;;
"Lmao ""intellectual bs talkshow""..";;
I love a lot of songs in different genres..;;
Let me listen to Picture.. I think I know that song..;;
Is it a duet with kid rock <@524820041976250368> ?;;
I love a lot of music too! Music is my life! Haha <@416803598173995018>;;
Yes <@526319824704634881>;;
Same <@524820041976250368>;;
Gotta go. Should be on later. Have a good rest of your nights/days!;;
<@416803598173995018> Later bro;;
Oh! I know that song <@524820041976250368> ! That's a cool song too..;;
You too! We will be here when you come back! <@416803598173995018>;;
Later <@416803598173995018> !;;
And yeah it‚Äôs one of my favorites <@526319824704634881>;;
But it's such a sad song tho..;;
Yeah it is in a way but it speaks to me if you know what I mean;;
Oohhhh.. got it;;
Before..I could never listen to Lips of an Angel coz it huts so much for me.. lol;;
I love that song too! But it is sad;;
I couldn't imagine life without music..;;
Do you play any instruments <@524820041976250368> ?;;
So, this is a bit when and how I stopped listening to some of the music I use to love...Please don't take me wrong and bare with me. I don't want to lunch a pity party here lol. But many of the songs I use to love only remind me of a time where my life was different and makes me feel depressed. So slowly I found my self avoiding listening to he radio and started replacing music by nature sound tracks like rain sounds, beach, blizzard you see what I mean. And lots of talking material.;;
That‚Äôs understandable <@348165887347523594> üíú and <@526319824704634881> I use to practice guitar and piano but I‚Äôm not good at it lol. What about you?;;
Good job <@!524820041976250368>, your dongle just grew to 16!;;
Totally understand <@348165887347523594> .. I was the same back then..I cry eveytime a certain song comes on so i just avoided all the songs that reminded me of my horrible past..;;
<@348165887347523594> I try not to associate the music with time or people in my life for that very reason;;
I agree with that but it‚Äôs hard <@343707181377388544>;;
Allows me to still enjoy the music I like;;
<@524820041976250368> I know how to play the basic chords on a guitar and ukulele.. I've always wanted to learn piano..but I'm a lazy potato..;;
That‚Äôs awesome! And Haha! <@526319824704634881>;;
It's hard not ro associate <@343707181377388544> ..but I see what you mean.. in time, the song just becomes just an ordinary song...;;
I want a another potato now thanks;;
<@343707181377388544> I agree, but this is very subjective. I was refraining myself to explain why because I know my reason is indeed subjective. I don't associate music to people, it's more that it reminds me before a very traumatic event happened in my life. Most happy moments that I have yet to find back.;;
Lmao.. sorry <@343707181377388544>.. here ü•î..;;
I just ate 4 baked ones at the restaurant I went to the waiter just stared at me;;
Good job <@!343707181377388544>, your dongle just grew to 5!;;
So whats everyone‚Äôs favorite movie?;;
Not to familiar with your traumatic event <@348165887347523594> but hope you get what need to be or feel better;;
Lmao <@343707181377388544> .. ;;
Stare at him too till you get another potato..;;
Let me think about that a moment <@524820041976250368>;;
<@343707181377388544> Thanks...I'm doing my best to get there üòâ;;
We are all here for you! <@348165887347523594>;;
<@524820041976250368> don't have a favorite but have quite a few if they are on I will finish it and not change the channel.;;
"It is hard to answer, so I'll tell you that the movie I probably watched the most was ""the matrix""";;
No particular one favorite but a lot <@524820041976250368> ...;;
I have not seen the matrix. I don‚Äôt think. <@348165887347523594>;;
Just watch the first one <@524820041976250368>;;
Same thing here....I had multiple movies I loved throughout my life. But pining one out is tough;;
And mine would be August rush or anything horror or comedy lol;;
On thw top of my head.. Inception, I Love You Man, Saw 1-3;;
Another one that I watched a whole lot is Fear and Loathing  in Las Vegas  with Jonny Dep and Benicio Del Toro;;
I understand that <@272988530278662146> here lately I haven‚Äôt had much time to watch tv or movies;;
I love all these movies you listed guys lol;;
Count of Monte Cristo;;
I haven‚Äôt seen those! <@348165887347523594>;;
I like the classic and the one with Leonardo <@526319824704634881>;;
Never saw that <@348165887347523594>.. but will put that on my list.. I love johnny Depp!;;
<@524820041976250368> Fear and loatthing in las vegas is a  masterpiece;;
Oh really?;;
To me,  Jonny Depp and Benicio del Toro's best work;;
There's this one Bollywood movie I absolutely adore.. 3 Idiots..;;
For musicals.. Phantom of the Opera..;;
Phantom of the opera also is a masterpiece;;
I love a lot and in different genres..same in music..;;
And yeah, found one that is one of my most beloved The life of pi;;
One of my bucket list is to watch Phantom live in London..;;
Haven't seen The life of pi.. is it heavy drama?;;
It must be quite an experience.;;
I‚Äôve seen phantom of  the opera it‚Äôs amazing;;
<@526319824704634881> It's a must see. One of the best movie I have ever seen. It's recent;;
Live <@524820041976250368> ?;;
No not live but I would love to see it live! <@526319824704634881>;;
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454876/;;
Is it heavy drama <@348165887347523594> ? I can't handle heavy drama as of the moment.. lol;;
I don't know if it can be called sad drama....It's not a comedy though...It is a drama. But I got out of it feeling very good <@526319824704634881>;;
Omg I love life of pi!;;
Right <@524820041976250368> ? it's a wonderful wonderful movie...like one of the best.;;
It is not a sad drama <@526319824704634881> , more an epic adventure with drama. One that I have only seen in this movie;;
Yes it is for sure! Have you seen wonder? <@348165887347523594>;;
I'm not sure,let me google it;;
It‚Äôs a good movie if you haven‚Äôt seen it;;
Okay..will watch The Life of Pi... Is it on netflix?;;
No I haven't <@524820041976250368> ...I like the cast...will do üòâ;;
I‚Äôm not sure if it is! <@526319824704634881> and let me know what you think! <@348165887347523594>;;
I don't know either <@526319824704634881> , it's not showing up for me...but there is the region lock thing so you'd have to check if it is available at your lacation;;
If I type the life of pi on google I get a result from netflix, but not when I log in Netflix;;
Sure <@524820041976250368>;;
"I'll check.. I was away from my pc for a bit there.. hehheh.. ""escaping"" work";;
Haha hopefully works going good!;;
lol;;
Work is fine...it's chill so far.. I went for a brunch break and walk around for a bit..;;
Life of Pi is pretty good;;
That‚Äôs awesome what kind of work you do? <@526319824704634881>;;
Hey! <@409836692158021632>;;
You see <@526319824704634881> , even <@409836692158021632> says so haha;;
Dude! We should totally do the movie thing you suggested <@348165887347523594>.. watching movies at the same time..;;
I would love to. It would be fun;;
Oohh! It's on Netflix! Wootwoot;;
Great haha !!!;;
Okay.. if the 3 of you approve then I'll watch it..;;
It's so much better to watch movies with people;;
Yeah you should, you won't regret it...it's not sad drama believe me...Or I would not even suggest it as me I too avoid all kind of depressing meterial;;
"I'm gonna watch this while ""working"".. wootwooot";;
Haha;;
I'd love to watch a movie but with <@207416847019016202> narrating it...;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> Life of Pi! I don't see any Pie???;;
That would be awesome <@409836692158021632> !;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;

I'm 10mins in watching Life of Pi.. but will check his stream and do a lurk maybe..;;
<@526319824704634881> Enjoy your movie üòâ;;
I will continue the movie.. it's interesting..but job stuff need to happen first.. lol;;
Thanks for the movie suggestion;;
Hope you enjoy the movie!;;
I'm done packing. I'm sure I'm not going to find any sleep...I'm going to finish gathering my papers in about 3 hours then get ready to leave;;
have a great trip <@348165887347523594> !!!;;
Thanks brother...I feel a bit more relax now I've finish packing. And I found someone to bring me to the airport. So I should be relaxed  when the time comes;;
nice! that's a true friend right there who's willing to take you to the airport;;
Yep, really that's nice...and it avoids me from paying the special parking for one week.;;
Where you going <@348165887347523594> ?;;
Florida;;
This is where most my family is;;
Very nice. Should be nice this time of the year there. My moms just north of Tampa;;
Oh ok, didn‚Äôt know that. Very cool!;;
Tampa is great...I have family there too;;
Lol small world! She‚Äôs in Port Richey, I think it‚Äôs about an hour north of there?;;
I'm not sure, I would need to check. Last time I went, I visited bush garden...had lots of fun there;;
It's a hot place though;;
Oh wow I haven‚Äôt been there since I was 15 or so I think lol. I enjoyed Orlando a lot. Universal studios was a blast;;
God damn Universal studio...damn, some of the best times in my life over there...especially Island of Adventure;;
Haha yeah man. I think it was 12 or 13 when I went but I remember everything. We did sea world, Disney and universal I think. The jaws ride was my favorite but it‚Äôs gone now sadly. Second was the terminator one, so much damn fun;;
Yeah yeah hell yeah;;
No maybe I was 11, I don‚Äôt remember lol. I only went once;;
I remember being terrified of the jaws ride. My dad tried so hard to convince me to go on it. Took forever lol. Once I did it, I couldn‚Äôt stop. I think we went like 5 more times haha. He‚Äôs like there‚Äôs so much more to see! Lol Jurassic park was cool too. Damn I remember a lot of that trip, good times;;
"The last time I went to Universal studio I got very lucky. My girlfriend at that time and I were going to check the price on the express pass( you know the pass that lets you go in the express line so no waiting in lines) . And when the lady told us it would be 80 more dollars for each of us (I think the ticket for one day was around the same price) we started to walk away and some guy walked to us. He said ""here, my family didn't show up and I got 4 express passes  so two days worth almost 360 dolars.";;
We have spent 2 days doing all the rides multiple times and could not believe this had just happened to us;;
Damn his family didn‚Äôt show up? lol that‚Äôs kinda sad but super awesome for you!  That‚Äôs so cool lol. Got to ride all the stuff multiple times. How far is it from where you are?;;
<@416803598173995018> I did feel pity for the guy...he seemed glad to make us happy, but I remember thinking wow, this is sad.;;
"You mean from where I""m going to be this week?";;
Orlando is at about 3 to 4 hours drive from Palm beach;;
Yeah that was really nice of him to do that. Ahh ok, never been to palm beach;;
It's at about an hour from Miami;;
Florida is the only place I know really in the states. I was too young to remember around when my grandmother was still alive in NY. The last time I went to NY I was probably 13 years old...a long long time ago;;
Haven‚Äôt been there either lol. I‚Äôve only been to Orlando, Clearwater and Tampa/port Richey.;;
I went to Texas multiple times also, but to young to remember around;;
Ahh ok. Yeah it‚Äôs tough to remember places sometimes;;
Lots of nothing in Texas lol;;
<@416803598173995018> yeah lol...and I think that my family despises this place;;
Despise Florida?;;
My uncle was shot there 5 years ago...in the leg in front of his house. He spent hours telling the cop to let him get to the hospital. They kept interrogating him for I don't remember how long. When he finally got to the hospital,he died from bleeding to death.;;
<@416803598173995018> no texas;;
Geez that‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm so sorry Kelly;;
I hope that cop lost his job;;
There is still an ongoing lawsuit against the cop but, at this point, we almost lost hope anything will happen;;
That‚Äôs so tragic. That person should not be a cop;;
This is the first time I actually felt he may have died because of his skin color;;
<@416803598173995018> yeah...bad training or I don't know what...I don't even wamt to know...I lived in a bubble all my life preventing me from dealing with that kind of shit;;
Unfortunately racism is still big in this country. As much as people want to not admit. I‚Äôve said before, I used to be a cop and honestly, one of the reasons I got out was cause my co workers. Not the majority, just a select few but they were awful;;
<@416803598173995018> Yeah, I believe the vast majority are not...but just one bad apple is enough to make some horrible deeds;;
Maybe 1 in a thousand is bad but they are very bad;;
Yeah exactly <@348165887347523594>;;
This is why I try not to think much about it. I was born French...and I'm verry different from my cousins...I don't really fit in with my American family cause I have not live their life...I can't even and don't considerer myself as Afro-American since I'm not...I'm just black...and they called me light skin black in the U.S. But racism is quite heavy from what I've seen in the us...from every races I mean;;
Yeah it truly is. I‚Äôve seen so many different forms from everyone. I look white but I am Portuguese and Senegalese so not white lol but people have called me all sorts of things. When people found out I was German in grade school, they all called me a nazi too. It‚Äôs sad. I‚Äôm not sure what it‚Äôs like in other countries but I hope not like this;;
<@416803598173995018> Racism in France is a lot more muffled if you see what I mean. America is one big place. But France is a Country spread all around the world and had to deal with segregation, racism and slavery much earlier than the U.S...so we don't have the same history.;;
"Racism exist everywhere...but some places it's just not that visible. In france, I would say that racism has been replace with xenophobia. It's more about where you came from. There is not that Black vs white thing that I've sense when I""m in the U.S";;
<@416803598173995018> I'm sorry to hear you have been called names...The human being can be pure shit sometimes;;
Ahh ok I understand. thanks but it‚Äôs never affected me. I don‚Äôt let what people say to me get me down or mad. It‚Äôs a waste. I‚Äôm sorry if you have ever experienced that here or anywhere else;;
Humans can be shit but I think there‚Äôs a lot more good people out there than bad. Unfortunately, the bad ones make the news headlines and the good ones go unnoticed a lot so it seems there‚Äôs a lot more bad than good;;
So true. No I never had to deal with it. The only thing me and my sister had to deal with were when we were in the states...Just being different...So we were more attracted to live in places where they are lots of immigrated students and visit our American family on weekends. I had people making jokes calling me Carlton (from fresh prince) lol but I never cared haha. Deep inside they just accepted that we were different from different culture. But I'm also proud of my American culture here. We just keep the racial thing away and I honestly don't give a damn about that light skin black bs. There is no such thing down here.This is pure american concept.;;
That‚Äôs good you had that mindset and never had to deal with it for the most part. Lol the fresh prince thing is kinda funny though;;
Yeah haha. I realize that I was probably seen like this...but it's more funny than bad ...I loved that series;;
"I'm gonna stay one entire week with no video games and I""m not even sure I'm going to have internet. Feels weird";;
Lol fresh prince was one of my favorite shows growing up. No games is ok, no internet would be very strange lol;;
You should come to California when mango does next year and we can all meet up, that would be great;;
I've been thinking about that for real. That would be awesome.;;
Yeah it would marklar is here too;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> I am?;;
Ho is he? I don't know why I thought he was in europe;;
ho my god <@409836692158021632> you made me jump hahaha;;
It's because of my proper English accent, mate! üòÇ;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
<@409836692158021632> Yeah maybe;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> Tea and Crumpets!;;
lol;;
I need to do more multiplayer and interaction with you guys to get my accent back in order too lol;;
This last month, I think that I spoke more english than I actually spoke French;;
Lmao <@409836692158021632> tea and crumpets;;
I‚Äôve been watching lots of different tv shows with people of different accents to practice for my accent off with sky daze lol;;
<@416803598173995018> I want to speak like skydaze so much lol;;
To me it's more about vocabulary xD;;
<@87241615671832576> Yeah of course...it's more about the vocabulary true. I've been reading watching and listening to so much in English lately that my French is getting bad like when I moved back here lol;;
Lol, well I am in a perpetual state of thinking English in my head and not being able to talk Danish and the other way around when I need to formulate my thought in English;;
<@87241615671832576> I see exactly what you mean lol;;
Lol I can replicate his accent pretty well  I think. I‚Äôve been practicing so much I accidentally spoke like it at the supermarket the other day. The girl said ‚Äúoh my gosh, you‚Äôre Scottish! What part are you from?‚Äù Lol it was funny;;
Lol I can replicate his accent pretty well  I think. I‚Äôve been practicing so much I accidentally spoke like it at the supermarket the other day. The girl said ‚Äúoh my gosh, you‚Äôre Scottish! What part are you from?‚Äù Lol it was funny #;;
God damnit. I hate discord app so much;;
haha Scottish changeover!;;
<@416803598173995018> When you stay in character so  much you lose your accent lol;;
Jess gimme mah Foking grossries lassie!;;
I've heard of many actors that have completely lost their native accents;;
lol yeah it‚Äôs tough. Especially when I do Irish, it just eventually turns into Scottish haha;;
Oh yeah I see what you‚Äôre saying. Yeah I can see that happening to actors;;
<@409836692158021632> lol;;
Irish, Scottish. Both are into alcoholic beverages, soccer and hate the Brits. I guess the accents are only one coincidence.;;
lol reminds of a scene in trainspotting ‚Äúsome people hate the British, I don‚Äôt. They‚Äôre just a bunch of wankers! We on the other hand, are colonized by wankers‚Äù;;
It‚Äôs a Scottish movie if you don‚Äôt know it lol;;
üòÖ;;
Good evening to you guys;;

That‚Äôs good to hear. I hope you keep improving! Yeah got a lot done around the house. How about you? I have Monday off too so that‚Äôs nice. It‚Äôs a holiday here in the states;;
Okay, I read it all. Here was a lot of heavy emotional stuff, and I will respond to messages that really touched my heart and made me cry:;;
 <@416803598173995018>;;
<@524820041976250368> ;;
I would die without music too!;;
<@416803598173995018> ;;
<@526319824704634881> ;;
I fucking love System of a Down!!!! Been to all 3 of their Moscow concerts.;;
<@526319824704634881> ;;
"I love ""I love you man"" too!";;
Halp meh;;
I'm in school;;
It's cold;;
<@348165887347523594> ;;
I understand that some music is heavy assosiated  with bad events, but what about new songs? There are always a lot of fucking cool new music;;
System of a Down is really cool;;
As Avril Lavigne new album for example haha;;
I prefer her older stuff  <@207416847019016202>;;
Me too;;
2nd and 3rd albums are the best;;
But I enjoy all the rest, and I love this new;;
It came out on friday;;
<@207416847019016202> that‚Äôs awesome! They are one of my favorites;;
I keep getting on my diet and I have appointment tomorrow for the following of things and see how much I lost etc ... i am nervous and excited !!;;
<@416803598173995018> here too in France it‚Äôs holiday !! Time of year everyone go to ski;;
Oof congrats  <@502171199850414081>, hope you do well!!;;
<@498246547838992414> thanks a lot ü§ó it will help my mind and my health state too !!;;
I'm glad;;
It‚Äôs weird because i am the type@of person who doesn‚Äôt look at how a person look if he or she is skinny or no etc I don‚Äôt care and it‚Äôs not the look who does a person but for me ... it‚Äôs another story I am suffering from a thing called;;
Let me find the traduction;;
Dysmorphic at a light state but still;;
If it makes sense;;
It looks like I am not seeing myself as i really am;;
The diet I am on changed my life. I always had always had bad stomach pain when I eat and the doctors couldn‚Äôt figure it out. I started doing the keto diet and I have barely had any since. Diets make a big difference so I hope it helps <@502171199850414081>;;
It surely will help the pain in the joints of my body <@416803598173995018> and just for that I will be thankful !!;;
That‚Äôs great to hear!;;
omg, person in the mirror looks so much like me;;
omg üòÇ üòÇ;;
<@207416847019016202> I was just saying why and when I slowly stopped listening to music brother. Some time I do, but mostly I find nature sound more relaxing;;
I like listening to that kind of stuff https://youtu.be/SynzKC4fWp0?t=339;;
sound of peeing under orange tree? <@348165887347523594>;;
Yeah that also lol;;
8 kills from 100 on wraith in apex lol. I think I‚Äôm playing too much;;
and too good for us;;
<@207416847019016202> ive never seen System of a Down live. I want to so badly though, I love them;;
what movie got a sequel, i cant find it in the chat and its bugging me üòÑ;;
how is it possible? <@416803598173995018>;;
they didnt play in LA?;;
first time they came in Moscow, it was 2011, and i lived in Vladivostok, 9000 km away from moscow. ;;
me and my brother spent a lot of money on tickets, but went there;;
<@442488674144223242> ;;
i read all of chat, but apparently i missed something about sequel;;
wait, trainspotting;;
i found it;;
They did but not when I lived here. They never came to Boston;;
wow thats strange;;
i was sure that bands come in every US city haha;;
Some bands don‚Äôt hit Boston, not sure why.;;
they were in russia 4 times;;
3 in moscow, and 1 on big festival;;
I missed a lot of bands that did country tours because they never came to Boston;;
That‚Äôs awesome <@207416847019016202> I‚Äôm jealous you saw them. Are they still together?;;
that is one of the main reasons why we moved to Moscow. ;;
90% bands who come to russia, come only to moscow;;
That‚Äôs a good reason to move there lol;;
That‚Äôs good thing about LA. Everyone comes here;;
they kinda fell out in 2006, then they came back in 2011 and started toured.;;
After that, theres on and off cycle of rumors that they fell off again, but after that theres new tour each time <@416803598173995018>;;
they have been in russia in 2011,2013, 2015 and 2017;;
after 2017 there were new rumors that they are done, but we will see;;
russia is VERY centralised in a lot of ways;;
everything depends on moscow;;
you live in Vladivostok and want your bank to make you new card? Wait 2 weeks till it will be delivered from main office from Moscow;;
Hopefully they come back. I wanna see them. That‚Äôs good about it being centralized;;
dont know, nothing good for people who not live in moscow;;
or st petersburg;;
Ahh that‚Äôs too bad;;
What are your other favorite bands? <@207416847019016202>;;
i dont know, a lot of rock and pop;;
Damn this is bad, I am having a skype meeting for an E course AND you know those people in games, who can't bother to switch off their mic, when they are not talking.;;
Sum 41;;
Avril Lavigne;;
Taylor Swift;;
Simple Plan;;
Panic at the disco;;
its possible the top ones;;
but theres a lot more <@416803598173995018>;;
I got this constant static noise going though my head;;
Arghhh and the person who needs to do the introduction is on a paper line;;
haha i know these people on meetings <@87241615671832576> ;;
btw discord mute sound when you dont speak;;
Yeahh, if I ever needed to have a meeting with a bunch of people I think i'd go for Discord rather than skype;;
<@207416847019016202> very cool. I like a few of those too.;;
Yey! Finally done with work for the day!;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;

Arghhh this sound is so bad!!!;;
tatu you mean russian band? <@87241615671832576>;;
I know what you mean <@87241615671832576>.. that is annoying..;;
Awesome <@207416847019016202>! I wasn't sure people here knew the movie I Love You Man! And yes..System of a Down is a great band..but I only know a few songs..;;
we spoke 2 hours but apparently not enough <@526319824704634881> ;;
missed a lot of movies and bands haha;;
Ikr! Missed a lot of topics to talk about and missed a lot of shots in Apex too.. üòÇü§£;;
<@207416847019016202> yes it was the Russian band.;;
Good job <@!87241615671832576>, your dongle just grew to 11!;;
Ohhh 11;;
the magical number;;
fuck those shots in apex <:Orange:545555843978887170> ;;
<@526319824704634881>;;

<@207416847019016202> next stream you should sing Taylor Swift - Shake it Off everytime you die;;
And good morning fellas üêº;;
I did it?  <@455797717763883009>;;
There gotta be a reason you mention this song;;
Maybe I sang it on stream, don't remember;;
Take care <@348165887347523594> ! Enjoy!;;
Thanks  <@526319824704634881>;;
<@207416847019016202> you were singing 'I just had sex' during your affiliate stream üòÇ;;
And then I said 'Just woke up';;
"And you started singing "" I just woke up"" in the same tune lol";;
Lol;;
I remember that haha  <@455797717763883009>;;
But my question was about shake it off;;
Cause I'm almost sure I sang it too on one if streams;;
Haha maybe, but I haven't listened to it. And hence the request.;;
Haha;;
Haha, the singing death;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> I will make Russia great again with my voice;;
no, i will probably use my voice only for my personal benefits;;
Not even to end world hunger?;;
üòÜ;;
especially that <:Orange:545555843978887170> ;;
<@345380744375566338>;;
to end my gf hunger mostly;;
Does she eat more than me? I eat maybe 5-6 times a day;;
she eats often, but limits her calories per day i think to 1800;;
My eyes!!!;;
They hurt,  I hate all this reading at screens;;
do you prefer paper? <@87241615671832576>;;
Not necessarily, sounds would be my best preference;;
Good morning;;

Lol, thanks. Literally did that for the first time last week;;

Youtube;;

Finally caught one of the We Ran out of Medals in D2 on vid;;
Will do so!;;

oh, also, if you like to read, I am also a writer and you can find sample chapters of my novel in <#512892929900150785>;;
Haha. Nah I'm just a guy who is passionate about gaming and like to comment on Twitter.;;
Ah awesome will take a look;;
But I will upload some random Destiny2/Doom clips now and then ;);
So what's the general consensus her on Anthem?;;
*here;;
awesome!;;
i'll be sure to watch them;;
um...;;
I think only <@348165887347523594> , <@278571432588345345> <@177155130859323392> and <@361554595354509312>;;
have it*;;
<@278571432588345345> played it with all of those guys, and said it was fun with friends;;
oh, <@136319407491121152> has it as well;;
and <@160543395037708288> ;;
fok my memory haha;;
so, yeah. they thought it was fun with friends, but the story wasn't amazing or anything;;
Love the gameplay but yeah it's not a mass effect;;
oh, also, a heads-up: there are A LOT of dongle jokes;;
<:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840>;;
<a:PickleRick:477501475933650955>;;
Haahha;;
Good job <@!504266876361244685>, your dongle just grew to 1!;;
1 inch dongle...awesome....;;
Hahaha;;
Yeah it's not Mass Effect. A lot of reviewers seem to miss the fact that a lot of the priming, movement and gunplay mechanics are posted directly from ME3 and Andromeda.;;
pickle riiiiiick;;
Flying is fun.;;
But story seems to be meh;;
I do an interesting rick impression. will do it on the stream if you stop by <@504266876361244685>;;
hmm;;
I actually didnt play andromeda;;
because people siad it was such shite;;
The patches have made it okay.;;
a shiet I'm a moderator now;;
drunk with powah;;
who moderates me <:palpatine:467237850593755137>;;

UNLIMITED PPOOOWWEEERRR;;
are you a star wars fan <@504266876361244685> ?;;
I used to love them;;
I mean, i still love the old o nes, the first 6 tbh;;
dont want to disappoint you, but its centimeters <@504266876361244685>;;
Well shit.;;
Hahaa;;
Big fan of the Star Wars universe, not a fan of some of the movies;;
Especially the last one. Ruined Star Wars for me a bit.;;
oh yeah, it is cm haha;;
I mean WHY IS LUKE A GRUMPY OLD MAN NOW?!?!!;;
yeah same here;;
right?!;;
THEY RUINED HIM;;
Big fan of the Star Wars universe, not a fan of some of the movies;;
exactly what i said to <@526319824704634881>  yesterday;;
ohhhh boi, we got a comrade in the making <@207416847019016202> and <@504266876361244685>;;
Tbh I have moved to other sci fi Universes lately. The Expanse is so good, and the most realistic one I've seen in ages.;;
And I fell into the Warhammer 40k love hole a few months back;;
my comrades and your comrades are different teams <@488734758847905803> ;;
so he will have to choose <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Going through the W40k Black Library books using Audible. MAAAN that's some good shit.;;
Horus Heresy series isüëå üëå üëå;;
I'll check out the expanse;;
are they novels?;;
they are everything;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DmYLrxR0Y8 - <@207416847019016202>;;
ohh i see. <@177155130859323392>;;
i take it youre a fan?;;
netflix series, audible audiobook;;
nice;;
I've only seen the first season;;
did you like it?;;
a wild <@177155130859323392> appears;;
<a:pokeball:467242552127389707>;;
The series is EPIC, the author actually worked closely with the show creators to adapt the novels;;
Amazon bought it all up recently, you can find all the seasons there.;;
lmao <@278571432588345345>;;
Finished season 3 last night. It's not my second favourite series....next to GoT of course. Because GoT;;
oh thats cool!;;
yeah;;
I do prefer the novels though of GoT;;
*now my second favourite;;
ah i see;;
yeah it's tough to bet GoT;;
Yup. I mean that series is unreal;;
yeah hard to beat the novels where you get all the characters' inner monologue;;
but GoT is still an awesome show;;
must be hard to retain all them names if you didn't read the stuff prior;;
they just name drop countless people hoping people will remember who they were;;
to be fair;;
the first time I read the first novel;;
"I had to just say, ""fuck it, I can't remember all these people""";;
dude I remember all of them, I drank in all that shit;;
random secondaries as well;;
I remember them now, because I read the series 2 times;;
but the first read/;;
like sir arthur dayne the sword of the focken morning;;
fuck. i couldnt;;
epic characters;;
yeah;;
GRRM is amazing;;
I was greatly inspired by him with my novel;;
in terms of how to write;;
POV all the way;;
I can't see myself ever writing something that isnt POV (point of view);;
Missandei sullier or unsullied;;
when Arya sees Illyrio in the dungeon with Varys in the first book;;
"and I was like... ""wait, who is that?""";;
lol;;
yeah I remember that I was confused too;;
and then I realized I wasnt going to be handed the characters' names on a silver platter;;
what does it mean..;;
I thought it was so original;;
;;
what up <@453672505727516673> !!;;
thanks for joining us under the shade of the mango tree, dude!;;
how are ya?;;
yoyo <@453672505727516673> <a:jumpingmango:546688169257467904>;;
just so you know, we got some moderators, <@278571432588345345> , <@207416847019016202> , and <@348165887347523594> if you have any questions.;;
you can post your twitch link in <#494741950575149056> when you go live (or mixer if that's what you use);;
<#546123700852752394> is where you can post youtube videos;;
<#509014397109141506> for your twitter and instagram;;
;;
"We have a ""program"" called <#525283886037467137> , which is really cool. each week a new person gets the spotlight turned to them and I post on my twitter when they go live, we go party in their chat and everything (timezones permitting of course)";;
;;
Each month we vote for 4 in a row, so right now we got <@160543395037708288> , then <@87241615671832576> , then <@409836692158021632> , then <@207416847019016202> ;;
;;
after that, we will vote for 4 more;;
ah, yes. and if you go to <#512649569595555860> and look at the pinned messages, you'll see the origin of hte dongle jokes;;
they happen a lot;;
Why only twitch and mixer? If you stream on chaturbate or something like this, pornhub or something, please post too  <@488734758847905803>;;
lmao;;

You cried? Ho no sorry. I got out of it so happy, I may have cried but not from sadness;;
Well not happy but feeling good;;
YOW <@348165887347523594> !!!!;;

I avoid the sad stuff when possible.;;
Hey <@526319824704634881> and <@343707181377388544>;;
What's up?;;
The movie that made me cry the most and even the most bad ass I know is Hatchico,  or Hatchi.  This shit will dry all the liquid out of your self and your eyes will  burn you for hours;;
I‚Äôve never watched that!  <@348165887347523594>;;
Waiting for a friend to download apex <@488734758847905803> but it may be awhile;;
Yes! Idk what category of emotion that is <@348165887347523594> but I think I understand what you mean..;;
My bad boy friends went full on cry babies live watching it;;
Oh wow;;
üíú;;
Hey <@488734758847905803> ! Just waiting for the time so I can go play or paint..;;
I haven't seen that movie too..is it English?;;
Will look into that movie.. but not now..if I need a good cry will watch that.. hehhe;;
I won't suggest you to watch it  <@526319824704634881> as it is sad. In the other hand I suggest you see it  <@524820041976250368> if you can stand it;;
<@526319824704634881> it's a true storie about the most famous dog in Japan. It has a monument on a public place.;;
The movie starred Richard Gear;;
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachi:_A_Dog%27s_Tale;;
Oh!! I think I'm familiar with that story.. yeah.. I'm not gonna watch that..;;
I‚Äôll watch it tho!;;
I haven‚Äôt seen it!;;
This shit is beautiful but you ll cry so much you will want the world to watch it. And you'll laugh at how much it will make you cry;;
You should;;
Oh wow really?;;
Really, trust me;;
Let me know how it goes <@524820041976250368>;;
Yeah, watch it  <@524820041976250368>;;
I can't wait to know;;
But what did you think of The life of pi  <@526319824704634881>?;;
I will! <@526319824704634881> <@348165887347523594>;;
Welcome  <@546062757032624129>;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 25!;;
Yes!! Done with work!!;;
GG;;
Felzgood;;
Yes...tuesday is done! Feelsgoodman..;;
I'm gonna backtrack a little.. you said you're an artist <@348165887347523594> ? What kind of art are you into?;;
I have been a professional drawer and painter since my teenage age. Like very seriously.  I started at 13 painting nudes which would be considered illegal nowadays.  I stopped after my accident. But I'm trying to find the inspiration back;;
I have posted something about a month ago on the pictures a meme tab;;
It's hard when you take a long break;;
True, but I still have it. I have made a couple returns at the drawing workshop and it seems that it d notre gone;;
I keep buying art pads and new pens or markers they have piled up haven't really been driven to draw in a while;;
<@343707181377388544> is it more because you lost the inspiration? This is what is happening to me. The material I buy usually stays here picking up dust me too.;;
After school I came to the realization that i needed to work a job for the money and wasn't even in a job that used art in anyway so i stop doing it i know i still have the skills but find i don't have the desire when its easier to flip on the game's  or chat up here with you guys but that doesn't mean I don't  want to  but when I get home from work (I stand and walk all 10 or more of my shifts), but it's also a time thing as well;;
I totally get that.;;
Also I would love to get a digital setup with a decent pad and pen;;
My mentor asked me if I could start assisting him with his student last summer and even that did not motivate me enough.;;
But I don't do digital though;;
I want to try I had a lot of my stuff get watered  damaged;;
Students at the drawing workshop I meant.;;
I see  <@343707181377388544>;;
Kinda sucked when I kept everything and I mean everything;;
I don't keep anything. I ve sold almost everything and what I haven't is gone;;
Do you have your paintings and drawings posted somewhere?;;
Nope. I have some picture which I ll post on picture and memes  <@526319824704634881>;;
I could never draw.. but I could paint.. ;;
I never knew it was possible to be able to paint and know nothing about drawing..;;
But my mentor has always pushed me to sell everything I do;;
I think it is possible  <@526319824704634881>. See, I'm not a great painter, I work hard that part and I still avoid it;;
I understand what you mean <@343707181377388544>;;
I hope you guys will get the mojo back and make drawings and paintings and lots of art!;;
I don't believe in keeping, well my mentor has convinced me that it's not here to be kept. Sell it as soon as you ve finished lurking at it. The pleasure is when you expose them.;;
Thanks  <@526319824704634881>;;
I just diacovered painting like a year or 2 ago... And I want to get better..;;
It will happen;;
<@526319824704634881>thanks I hope so;;
<@526319824704634881> if you like it, just do. Don't hesitate taking classes;;
I posted some of my paintings in Social Media in Jonny's discord.. I tried copying paintings..;;
I'm a poor potato...so youtube classes are the only ones I can afford.. lmao..;;
Hello everyone!;;

Nice  <@526319824704634881>;;
We in Russia have fast food chain that basically called baby potato  <@526319824704634881>;;
Whaaaat?!!! I have a baby I didn't know about?!!!;;
And the baby is Russian?!!!;;
And this is chain of babies  <@526319824704634881>;;
OH MY GOD!;;
I hope they grow up to be the best potatoes in Russia.;;
Haha they are not;;
It's fast food, they are pretty shitty imo;;
Damn..poor baby potatoes...;;
They are half breed so maybe that's why it's shitty...;;
 The best potato lives in the Philippines! Lmao;;
Haha you're racist  <@526319824704634881>;;
Or... potatist;;
"Hahahhaha.. ""potatist""";;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
lol;;
hey <@87241615671832576>;;
morning üòÉ;;
Morning;;
almost noon for me;;
Yeahh 9:38 here :), but who counts üòâ;;
How are you?;;
im good, want to eat;;
Any preferences?;;
yeah, it needs to be food;;
if i have lunch alone, i just go to food court and have some fast food;;
if i lunch with colleagues, i eat at lunch place;;
Ahh okay üòÉ;;
How‚Äôre you? <@87241615671832576>;;
I am good, just doing some study and waiting for my coffee to be ready üòÉ;;
How are you <@524820041976250368> ?;;
Sounds relaxing, I‚Äôm good, just laying here listening to music;;
Sounds nice üòÉ;;
What are the music?;;
Lol yes I‚Äôm exhausted, 2000‚Äôs R&B songs;;
Ahh, I actually think that was the only thing which was decent in the 2000's beides the garage punk music, which just wanted to make fun with the establisehd scene;;
Right, lol what I listen to is based off my moodüòÇ;;
I get that. i have the same thing. Currently I have been obssesed with indie musicians who make tribute songs to games üòÑ;;
Oh really! Like who? I haven‚Äôt listened to indie music in a long while;;
I have a small list here;;
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuiUqoacrfldc_IOmVHlo-QKWVJkE9M7L;;
this is more or less everything I have been able to find, but there's lods more and more musicians I have not discovered yet, so it's a journey;;
Unfortunately I've only seen Miracle of Sound go DRM free.;;
I'd love to be able to show  more people this music;;
It‚Äôs great! I love itüíú;;
i have a dream of combiling one big list of these musicians and be able to sort out the best 5 songs of all and just have a big list people can look into.;;
But it require some time and effort though;;
That‚Äôs for sue I hope it all works out!;;
Maybe üòÉ i don't know;;
aye goodmorning everybody!!;;
Morning <@446411352035033089>;;
how are you today;;
im pretty  good just waking up preparing for a morning stream how about yourself?;;
Pretty good, working;;
morning stream is a good thing;;
but for me its only on weekends;;
Morning stream really sounds like something very specific;;
i do it on saturdays;;
wake up in 9 and stream in 10;;
its actually only my stream that <@526319824704634881> can watch;;
I know, but a morning stream could also be something completely different üòÑ;;
it's very yellow and should be done alone üòÑ;;
Sorry i am just being a dick now.;;
"haha i understood after words ""completely different""";;
the rest was extra haha;;
lol i see what you mean but yeah just a early day stream starting at like 8 am;;
Sounds good though;;
would make sense to spread out;;
its a big matter of understanding another language and accepting words from it.;;
"for example, in russian language we of course have word for ""stream"". ";;
"But when it comes to new thing like streaming games and streaming music and video, we dont use russian variant, we just say ""stream"" in english.";;
so for me its different words;;
Morning folks üêº;;
Oh wait, it's noon;;
its evening soon haha;;
It's always evening in Russia;;
its because im most active in evening;;
You're active 24/7;;
haha no;;
I could barely jump on discord yesterday, just the beginning of the week and I was loaded with work;;
Today's much better;;
i dont have a lot of energy during the day, and it decreases when evening is near..;;
and when i come home at 7-8 pm, i really out of power, almost falling asleep.;;
but then i take a shower, eat dinner, and after 9-10 pm its BOOOM, and wow, i got a lot of energy to do anything i want and to go to sleep only in the morning;;
Haha happens, especially when I'm gaming;;
I stayed up till 4 everyday before work when Spider-Man released;;
And I'd go sleep at work lol;;
yeah;;
and i had more tough periods, when i practiced programming a lot and went to sleep at 5-6, to wake up in 9;;
Damn;;
and to be honest, it was not against my will, i have enough energy for that;;
I would just take off the next day. I need at least 4 hours sleep;;
it was what i wanted;;
Then there's just me, who just want to stay up for 20 hours a day, but I can't live on less than 7 hours of sleep;;
if i sleep 7 hours or more, it bad for me, im very sleepy the whole day after that;;
5-6 is optimal;;
I wish I had it like that;;
My head don't work below 7 hours üòÑ;;
I am just sitting and staring out in the open;;
I usually sleep 7-8 hours;;
Don't see any big releases in the next few months that could make me lose my sleep;;
Maybe a different story after E3 though;;
Yep.. I can only watch when <@207416847019016202> streams on twitch on weekends..;;
That sounded wrong;;
we both know it is exactly what you meant üòâ;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Lol  <@526319824704634881>;;
I need to edit that.. hahahahah;;
Good job <@!526319824704634881>, your dongle just grew to 9!;;
wootwoot! dongle growth!;;
i usually sleep 5 to 6 hours;;
now it doesnt sound less dirty <@526319824704634881>;;
maybe once a fortnight I'll crash early;;
It's only in your head <@207416847019016202>;;
everything that i have in my head, i stream on saturday mornings <@526319824704634881>;;
exactly the same for me <@442488674144223242> ;;
5-6 hours, but sometimes i sleep extra;;
Great, now I have 2 burned fingers due to a crazy tortilla;;
at least you have fingers, not everyone can say that;;
i can sleep extra if its sleeping in. but rarely do i got to bed earlier;;
TRUE;;
I just have to power through the pain;;
Hello all;;
I was pleasantly sleeping profoundly and boom , my clients just started harassing me üòû;;
It was too good to be true;;
"did you say ""fuck off im american now""? <@348165887347523594>";;
I honestly wish lol;;
But reality will kick in in a week and I ll still need money;;
Especially when I see how much money these week is going to cost me;;
This week;;
ha i got you, my vacation will cost me too;;
Haha, life sucks üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;
I need to start playng some lottery;;
But then , it's just gonna cost me more money;;
Dude my hotel room is 130 pee night this shit is heavy on my finances. Especially when not planned;;
Ah, life without kids. I used stay up and not take naps. Then I had kids. Its a neccesity because I love my family, and I don't want to be grumpy all day. I also hit the weights hard for powerlifting, so I need the sleep to recovery and build muscle and strength.;;
130 per night is not cheap, i agree. in russia its mostly 50-70.;;
but in hostel it can be 10-15;;
Yow <@348165887347523594> !;;
Yes! Power through <@87241615671832576>! Eat that tortilla extra hard for burning your fingers <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Lol it has been eaten, and are currently being digested;;
Noice!;;
Hey  <@526319824704634881>, hope your day was a good day;;
<@207416847019016202> yeah, I think it is because of the holiday.  I was like what the fuck when I saw the prices;;
I usually aim at 70 if possible. Yesterday was 160 for the majority of decent hotels I found;;
Damn I just converted the prices to our currency..and yeah..that hotel is pretty expensive.. I hope it's a good one;;
how much 120 bucks in potatoes? <@526319824704634881>;;
It's good but not worth that price  <@526319824704634881>;;
<@348165887347523594> my day was decent.. chill day at work..practiced a little ukulele and guitar..and played apex..;;
6200 Mordor Pesos <@207416847019016202>;;
Oh fuck that expensive <@526319824704634881>;;
1usd is about 52 mordor pesos;;
;;
;;
;;
Sounds like a nice day overall  <@526319824704634881>;;
Why are your clients harrasing you <@348165887347523594> ?;;
nice <@348165887347523594>;;
Decent room Kelly!;;
Anyways..gtg..need to sleep.. good night everyone!;;
<@526319824704634881> It's my life story. I fix I.T related issues. And problems seem to occur especially when I'm gone;;
ah, nothing like working a helpdesk;;
suckiest job ever;;
beats cleaning up vomit from public toilets though;;
Yeah üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;
Mornin Mangoes!!;;

working the bacon as well;;
Morning mango seeds!;;
The mobile data and wifi were down until literally this second;;
Now we have mobile data;;
I love this town for a lot of stuff. But  working and basic use of the internet is not one of them;;
Sorry to hear you're sick <@218024335682699264>;;
That suuucks;;
Nice room <@348165887347523594>;;
<@526319824704634881> I love the new profile pic hahaha;;
Hey <@442488674144223242>;;
yo;;
How goes the land of kangaroos?;;
Ah, do you know why kangaroos are called kangaroos? An interesting story actually;;
when they landed here they asked an indigeneous person what it was and that was the response;;
although the different tribes had different names;;
that was the first the english heard;;
Booya;;
Got some culture going in the mango tree;;
However, there's one little detail that is different from what I learned;;
"That the English speakers were like ""what is this?*";;
"And the indigenous people said ""what is he saying?""";;
"And in their language it was ""kangaroo""";;
"So then they would point and say ""what is this?""";;
Kangaroo;;
What is this?;;
Kangaroo;;
But that could be incorrect of course;;
It's just what I learned;;
could be that way too. it was 32 years ago I would have learnt it;;
Oh damn haha;;
i know that when they sent the platypus back to England they thought it was a prank;;
Hahahaahahah;;
Oh shit really?;;
That's hilarious;;
Morning everyone!;;
Yo <@416803598173995018>;;
You early fucking bird;;
Oh shit, the timezone is different now;;
Is it 7:20 for you?;;
haha yep 0720 for me;;
Got up at 0510;;
Fucknuts;;
Well, now we are only 5 hours apart;;
I just fell out of the fucking bus;;
I'm pissed;;
Fell out? How?;;
Are you ok?;;
I have massive pain in my left wrist, and hip;;
<@488734758847905803> nice! How much longer you staying there?;;
wait what? <@498246547838992414> are you ok??;;
As for how i fell, the bus is always packed, so some people try to push everyone out of the way, and I was gonna get out, and my foot got caught behind some persons bag, and I fell on the corner of the sidewalk;;
With my hip that is, so I'll be fine;;
I'm okay, thanks for asking  <@416803598173995018>;;
That sucks <@498246547838992414> ;;
<@416803598173995018> until Sunday now I think, because my brother in law is coming to visit, and <@467974634977886220> doesn't want to leave as soon as he arrives;;

When I lived in Holland in 2011, I went to a McDonald's to use the bathroom;;
I had to pay to use jt;;
I was like wtf?;;
I dropped some coins;;
Under the table. I found a blackberry;;
Yup, that's the Netherlands for ya;;
f that if i have to go i have to lol;;
Hahaha yeah it's crazy;;
Ah true (about your class <@312379820933906442> );;
In Belgium it's only like that in some restaurants;;
Yeah same here in Brazil;;
I like Belgium, despite how much I complain;;
It's comfortable to live here;;
the usa u dont have to pay like anywhere to go lo;;
lol;;
True that haha;;
I think I'd like Belgium except for the cold;;
Yeah <@312379820933906442>;;
In that sense the USA is cool;;
But lots of crazies there;;
It's not that cold here, only in the winter  <@488734758847905803>, In summer it's hot as balls;;
Not that I have a right to talk about crazies;;
Brazil is so fucked up right now;;
crazies are everywhere to be honest;;
Hotter than Brazil you think <@498246547838992414> ?;;
It gets hot as balls here for breakfast;;
It got up to 37¬∞C last summer  <@488734758847905803>;;
Pfff;;
It was 39 degrees during my silent Hill 2 stream;;
Oh shiiiit;;
Hahaha yeah it was crazy;;
And we don't have an air conditioner;;
They're expensive af here;;
But Belgium isn't that cold, only in the winter;;
Spring and Fall are actually pretty warm;;
Here all the crazies live in antwerp  <@312379820933906442>;;
idk the scale between degrees farenheit to degrees celsius;;
Neither do I,  <@312379820933906442> Farenheit is weird;;
In Celsius we boil water at 100 degrees and 0 freezes;;
39 degrees Celsius is 102.2 Fahrenheit;;
I melt at 25¬∞C;;
32 degrees f is 0 degrees c;;
Yep;;
Lol;;
where i live in the winter;;
25 C degrees is nothing;;
it goes down to about 28 degrees at times;;
It is for me  <@488734758847905803>, I can't handle heat at all;;
What state do you live in?;;
and in the summer goes up to 110-120 degrees at times;;
120?!;;
Holy fucking shit;;
i live in virginia;;
Do you live on the part of Virginia that's on the fucking equator?;;
when i say 120 its with the humidity and everything;;
Ah ok;;
So temperature sensation;;
i live in virginia beach;;
Last summer I gave up on living, I just layed on my bed the entire day;;
lol <@498246547838992414>;;
That's insane;;
*Country Roads, take me home*;;
Hahaha;;
yea it normally is about 100 in the summer;;
and the winter is noramally 30s-40s;;
normally;;
That's crazy;;
our weather is usually bipolar;;
like lately one day we will have it up to like 75 and then the next day it will go down to like 30;;
everyones getting sick cause of the weather changing so much here;;
Yeah same here right now;;
Global warming has fucked up our seasons here too;;
yea f that lol;;
It was like super cold in the middle of summer the other day;;
And in the winter we get super warm days;;
We always say that to live in Sao Paulo you have to have a pair of shorts, pants and, a jacket;;
At all times;;
<@488734758847905803> global warming isnt real though! lol;;
Not sure how much you all know about American politics so this actually may not be funny to anyone here lol;;
Hahahaha;;
I know that Trump doesn't believe in it;;
Or he claims to not believe;;
Fucking denier;;
lol yeah, he's just an idiot;;
He really is;;
I don't believe either. Does it makes me trump?;;
You don't believe in global warming?;;
Yeah you are a Trump too <@207416847019016202>;;
It just means you deny scientific evidence;;
Hes orange just like you! lol;;
Yeah.  I just don't care;;
No it means I don't care about science and it's evidence;;
Ah;;
People care too much about shit;;
Not caring and not believing are two different things;;
I mean. I care, but honestly, what can we as citizens do?;;
Feels more like a political/activist thing;;
I feel like no one saw my orange comment or appreciated it lol. I thought it was damn good;;
Hahahaha;;
Omg you're right!;;
He is orange;;
And Trump is orange;;
Okay. But to believe you need first to take time to learn about this. And I don't care till take this time;;
Good job <@!207416847019016202>, your dongle just grew to 30!;;

We're the Russians of the southern hemisphere;;
Haha southern Russians it's something different;;
And you're the Brazilians of Europe;;
I am Brazilian of nothing;;
You are the Pele of Russian hatred;;

They are too empathic for my taste;;
Which is why you're so good at it for a Russian;;

Hey! <@416803598173995018> I‚Äôm good how‚Äôre you?;;
Not too bad, just having some breakfast. Been a stupid day of work so far;;
i told <@455797717763883009> today, i get tired before dinner, but after that i have a lot of energy to get to the morning <@416803598173995018>;;
Get all that fuel from the food in you lol;;
How was your weekend <@207416847019016202> ?;;
Did you miss my voice?;;
"no, i said ""heyguys"" to myself all the time <@416803598173995018>";;
you ask me about last weekend, but im honestly already all thoughts in next;;
especially since its when my vacation starts;;
lol you probably had mark clip me saying that so you can listen to it over and over;;
ahh very nice. Where are you going for vacation?;;
It's the FOOD <@207416847019016202>;;
dubai;;
Damn, thats really cool! I have heard Dubai is a very interesting city;;
<@207416847019016202>  entering the country like;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEO26yNqwns;;
*Tall buildings in Dubai*;;
yeah exactly <@455797717763883009>;;
lol;;
heya <@416803598173995018>  ! ;;
gonna re-watch Fight Club and get ideas for your emote üòÇ;;
lol awesome! @great movie. Thank you!!;;
no worries, man!;;
hello <@455797717763883009> !;;
how is the story for Anthem?;;
is it ok, meh or good awful terrible?;;
also <@348165887347523594> and anyone else who is playing Anthem...;;
how are you liking the story so far?;;
Yo <@409836692158021632>;;
I didn't get through Anthem much;;
The story in the beginning felt a bit bland. didn't feel much depth in it;;
But i was just starting, so maybe the best part is yet to come;;
The matchmaking puts me off though;;
why do you need ideas? i think blooded face will be alright <@409836692158021632>;;
I was doing a mission solo, and had to recover this loot or something. I found it but couldn't open it or collect it;;
Basically I couldn't finish the mission. So i just closed it lol;;
Having a blast  <@409836692158021632>;;
Yeah it's not about the story at all;;
thanks <@455797717763883009> !;;
<@278571432588345345> what are you enjoying about Anthem the most so far?;;
Feeling like iron man;;
I want an IRON MAN game!;;
Gameplay is amazing and looks and runs amazing on PC;;
Also playing with friends is a blast;;
ah ok. ;;
thanks <@278571432588345345> ;;
I had tons of fun with my buddies during the demo;;
Yeah man;;
What are you playing on?;;
I'm on PS4. ;;
I don't have Anthem yet but I'm deciding or trying to decide if I should pick it up this Friday;;
I'm just trying to get first hand opinions from the wisdom of the Mango Tree;;
there is not such thing <@409836692158021632>;;
you better do it random;;
ok...I will seek wisdom from The Orange Tree <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
orange tree is to tall to care about anthem;;
üòÇ;;
<@409836692158021632> I don't think it is worth 60 bucks to be honest . It's very fun and all but not worth full price. Good with an origin premier account or gamepass. But I can't recommend it at full price;;
I would have paid full price happily with just the weekend I had with friends;;
Easy;;
Nice to know  <@278571432588345345>. This is good to hear some balanced opinion;;
okay its decided now, <@278571432588345345> wil pay for <@409836692158021632>;;
üòÇ üòÇ;;
Is that how it works in russia?;;
Others make decisions for you?;;
lmfao;;
In Russia, Orange decides for you;;
yeah. everybody in russia knows jonny will pay;;
I'm not sure what to think about it. If I had not had origin premier I'm convinced that I would've bought it on ps4;;
well i see no joke here, it was exactly what <@278571432588345345>  said;;
I would have paid full price happily <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Language barrier I guess;;
"That somehow means ""pay for someome else""";;
well it was not specified;;
"Or maybe ""exactly"" means opposite";;
haha <@207416847019016202>;;
So not exactly then if not specified;;
It feels that the game has shown all it had to offer in just one weekend .;;
appreciate the feedback fellas!;;
And yet I cant wait to go back to it  <@348165887347523594>;;
interesting <@278571432588345345>;;
Me too honestly  <@278571432588345345>. I was thinking about it last night and today. I need more.;;
I would have been more eager to join if you guys were on a console rather than on master pc;;
but I am still concerned about paying full pric emyself;;
But would I recommend it out of a gamepass or premier access? I'm troubled;;
Pc master race dude;;
Good job <@!278571432588345345>, your dongle just grew to 13!;;
yeah, feelzbad;;
one day;;
one day i'll stand on that podium with you gusy;;
guys*;;
Get rigged or get knicked;;
lmao;;
Lol;;
#GetRiggedorGetKnicked <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> get rigged or get chinese adidas;;
So,  you would recommend it full price on console  <@278571432588345345>?;;
Whoa whoa whoa;;
Why the Adidas gotta be Chinese? üòÇ;;
No, I haven't played it on console;;
Ok ok;;
in russias 90s - it had to <@409836692158021632>;;
cause theyre knockoffs <@409836692158021632> haha;;
Haha;;
https://opencritic.com/game/7084/anthem;;
And I think Karak's review would be to wait for a sale and when more content has been added. Like with Destiny;;
ah true;;
Yeah;;
I spoke to karak about it;;
if you account share maybe it's worth it, since you'd pay 50% off;;
I really love the flying though;;
Ya;;
<@348165887347523594> Will ask you about that mission i'm stuck with later on;;
We agree that it's either a 15 dollars worth game as it is now. A great game on gamepass or premier account, but not worth a 60 bucks as right now.;;
<@455797717763883009>ok;;
Yeah, they're being hasty with the release;;
I would love everyone to get it and assure that it gets better. But I can't in good faith recommend it right now. Maybe in a month;;
I had lots of fun and the combat is nothing like I have experienced so far. Flying around like a bunch of iron men is phenomenal;;
Iron Men;;
Sounds wrong dude;;
Lol;;
iron dongles;;
I thought that I should use plural since I said a bunch lol;;
Yeah it made it a lot worse;;
Freelancersss;;
We ll put this on language barrier Haha;;
lmao;;
Is the game on gamepass though?;;
If it is it's a go;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFJzMKXCj9k;;
Endyo on point lol;;
Not on Gamepass;;
endyo from the ACG discord <@455797717763883009> ?;;
Yes him  <@488734758847905803>;;
Yup;;
He makes these quick reviews. I like the format.;;
And he's got a good voice too;;
yeah;;
very silky;;
His review is a bit harsh but I don't see anything refutable in what he says.;;
Yeah he's blunt, but says it nicely lol;;
I knew already what he had to say about it though . Were you here when we were discussing it  <@455797717763883009>? I'm can't remember if it was you?;;
I don't think it's all there is to say about the game but he outlined a good chunk of it.;;
Yeah I did see what he said.  But didn't involve in the conversation;;
Ok ok;;
The loading screen is a real issue.;;
Silver posted that link lately https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/arp3su/in_a_two_hour_session_the_game_read_610gb_from_my/;;
It's pretty crazy.;;
Damn that does not sound good. Hopefully they resolve it quickly;;
Apex news: ;;
New update posted and the slow mo revive bug is fixed!;;
Pathfinder skin and Apex packs for twitch prime! ;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
nice!;;
too  bad I got apex for ps4 lmao;;
Sweet! <@409836692158021632> I have prime, wonder what they will be;;
You can get these for PS4 too <@488734758847905803>;;
niceee;;
any details on what the packs are? Im assuming just skins;;
They need to fix the bug where you run really slowly and its choppy. Ive been getting that at least once a game every time I play;;
Noice, just claimed mine. Gotta wait until I'm home to see what I got;;
1 pathfinder skin;;
The Apex packs are random;;
<@416803598173995018> they fixed that slow mo revive bug;;
Morning guys;;
whoops, I totally read that and it didnt compute in my head the first time you said it <@409836692158021632> thanks!;;
Too bad I dont use pathfinders lol. Morning <@526319824704634881>;;
Hey <@416803598173995018> !;;
Yeah..I don't use Pathfinder too..;;
Haha;;
That's cool!;;
I hate that bug...;;
Will you guys be streaming more apex? üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ;;
Yeah  the bug was annoying as hell. Yeah I will hopefully be streaming today but if not, definitely tomorrow;;
Hope you all are having a good day!;;

Thank you! <@416803598173995018>;;

Can't sleep!!;;
Why not? <@87241615671832576>;;
No clue, it just happens once in a while for me.;;
Oh okay, how‚Äôre you besides not being able to sleep?;;
I am good :) I've been wondering how I should approach a quick run down of what one hour, one life is.;;
And I find stuff like;;
https://youtu.be/Ut_cfzCD9ug;;
Oh wow;;
And https://youtu.be/7TqEtE79YSc;;
I have totally gone I to an indie corner;;
Those are cool;;
I'd wish I had enough money to just buy all interesting indies, but that's not going to happen üòÇ;;
Haha rightüòÇ;;
Luckily there's a final amount of good titles, compared to the infinite number of bad ones;;
TRUE;;
How are you <@524820041976250368> ?;;
Good not prepared for this sleep study I gotta do <@87241615671832576>;;

You guys should have seen that team kill in the end! Was so damn intense!;;
Oh right, I have to clip that lol;;
wheres <@409836692158021632> ?!;;
It was right around the 1 hour 40 minute mark on my stream. I can't get it to clip the whole team wipe. He's so much better at this than I am lol;;
Got it! Posted in the pics and memes section;;
Morning everyone;;
I just slept 10 hours;;
You can call it Big Recharge;;
It should be enough for my vacation exhausting trip;;
Haha and I am just about to go to bed. Glad you got some good sleep before your trip orange. I‚Äôm headed to bed, night all!;;
Fuck your time zone  <@416803598173995018>;;

It will be in 2 days haha  <@348165887347523594>;;
Ho ok ok lol;;
I don't use discord as much since I mainly use it to watch videos and Netflix right now;;
I just noticed right now that Netflix has a mini floating windows when switching to another app. Very nice;;
I'm using a galaxy s9, not a huge phone but it feels nice being able to keep watching my video and do other things mean while;;
I forgot my surface charger I'm stuck with only my phone;;
Haha I never had surface charger, and my cord charger doesn't work very well, so for me charging is pretty intimate process;;
What?? üòÖ;;
I don't understand a thing of what you just said bro lol;;
What is surface charger?;;
When you just place your phone on a charger?;;
Ho...the Microsoft surface pro;;
It's half PC half tablet;;
"Adding word ""microsoft"" doesn't clear it up";;
Ah ok;;
Google it;;
I thought you meant type of charger;;
No üòÇ üòÇ;;
Hey everyone. Going to sleep but I hope you all have a freaking wonderful day and that you all see dongles raining;;

<@348165887347523594> just goto Russia;;

I'm on the PS4 currently. Some indie PC games like Astroneer etc. I play Apex, BO4, Dead By Daylight, Realm Royale on the PS4;;
I'll dream I'm on a roller coaster ride on the seat right behind you. Your dongle slipping out under the over powered wind and flapping with rage in the vaccum of Disney world. Ho boy what a view  <@488734758847905803>. Dream like;;
Now I'm ready to sleep;;
ah true cool;;
lmao <@348165887347523594>;;
you have to write a book about dongles, cause your creativity is outta this world;;
hahaha;;
so you like more competitive games?;;
Typically yeah but I have a soft spot for adventure games and stories;;
oh nice;;
me too!;;
I love me some final fantasy;;
Also, if you like reading, I got sample chapters of my novel in <#512892929900150785>;;
I haven't played FF in so long. 11 maybe? The last one I played. With the underwater soccer haha;;
that was 10;;
Tidus and Sin and stuf;;
that was the first one I played  and beat;;
10 yeah that was so long ago haha;;
I tried FF7, but I was like 9 at the time and could not for the life of me get past the open world bit;;
Yeah so gud;;
I am going to do a run of that on my stream in the coming weeks;;
I need me some Tidus;;
Ohhh;;
and Yuna;;
Lets go;;
I'm soooo gonna cry with that opening song;;
I wish I could tattoo that song so I could listen to it whenever I wanted to;;
It's ok to cry. Major display of strength and fortitude;;
my dongle just spasmed thinking about that possibility;;
I learned that on guitar;;
To Zanarkand;;
major display of alpha dongle;;
omg that song is amazing;;
on guitar it must be hard af;;
so many cords;;
chords?;;

mckee is one of my inspirations for sure;;
guy is amazing;;
yeah he's insanely good;;
art of motion, drifting;;
such good songs;;
yeah listened to those a ton of times;;
A world announced by all physicists,  an accelerated beam of dongles strings  pulled by a  tear in space time attracting the + and the - capable of punching through the material obstacles and tearing through the evens to bring us us all to the edge of the mango tree of life. No need for games or movies. Every dongles will be dangling everywhere and everywhen in the river of mango juice. I feel that I'm going to have some sweet dreams;;
that's a trip dude;;
how is your trip speaking of <@348165887347523594>;;

We will see;;

Cause game is shit;;
üòÇ game does look difficult but still a good game;;
I'm doing pretty good  <@416803598173995018>;;
I have different standards. If game is tough, it's probably shit for me  <@524820041976250368>;;
Except, this hood is annoying me now;;
Because whenever I exhale, my glasses steam up Lmao;;
Lol CrimseNinja;;

My hair is gonna look bad af though;;
Lol <@!498246547838992414> challenge declined if you take it off;;
I'm still wearing it lmao;;
For now lol;;
I will take it off before dinner, I don't think people will like it if I'm wearing a mask at the table, It would be also very hard to eat;;
üòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
Eat through a sttraw;;
Good advice- shave your head  <@498246547838992414>;;

I love fruit;;
I like oranges just not orange juice unless I squeeze it myself;;
Here goes  <@524820041976250368>, cold hearted Orange squeezer;;
Apples are my favourite tasting fruit, oranges are the best looking;;
I knew you was about to say something like thatüòÇ <@207416847019016202>;;
Wow now I'm predictable orange;;
Yes you are I‚Äôm a good observer;;
Good job <@!524820041976250368>, your dongle just grew to 17!;;
And now we got to observe your dongle;;
Faaack  <@524820041976250368>, you're gonna beat me soon;;
Haha üòÇüòÇ you ready for this competition? <@!498246547838992414>;;
*End me*;;
Would be my pleasure üòÇ;;
Seriously, you beat me at everything lmao;;
Lmao not everything;;
Name 1 thing;;
*I challenge you*;;
I‚Äôm not even a competitive person you started itüòÇ;;
Wha- ME?!?!?!;;
Orange was the one who started it lmao;;
Haha no he encouraged it you started it  lmao;;
Okay okay...;;
And the one thing you‚Äôre beating me at is the fact you‚Äôre a streamer and I‚Äôm not but don‚Äôt hold your breath haha;;
You gonna stream one time?  <@524820041976250368>;;
Haha not likely;;
Also, you have more followers than me lul;;
*I'm gonna jump off a cliff*;;
On what twitch?;;
Yes;;
*teach me*;;
Twitch mee;;
XD <@455797717763883009>;;
Oh haha it comes along with being a supporter of a lot of streamers and connecting with them;;
Lol. I'm so fucking bored at work;;
Don't mind me, I'll just pop in and pop out <:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840>;;
It comes along with being a good person so forget it  <@498246547838992414>;;
Lmao^^^ he‚Äôs right;;
See, I got like 20 from doing the same, then I stopped lmao;;
And yeah <@207416847019016202>, being a good person is hard for me;;
And never supported anyone, it's just everybody loves salty;;
üòÇ myself if I ever became a streamer I‚Äôd still be supporting others it‚Äôs just in my nature to do so.;;
I lost the will to live after having to keep up with more than 30 different streamers;;
So I gave up lmao, now I support streamers who I personally really like;;
Haha ask  <@524820041976250368> she will teach you how to handle it;;
Do I need to put your dongle back in its place? <@!498246547838992414>;;
Yeah, I support when I can, just not trying to actively support, if that makes sense;;
I know lol;;
lol oh ok <@207416847019016202> I didnt know how far you were getting;;
Look at you two, touching each other dongles already   <@524820041976250368>  <@498246547838992414>;;
Haha;;

haven't slept, but still wide awake;;
I hate when that happens. I used to get that all the time when I worked night shift;;
My sleep schedule gets messed up from time to time;;
Same. I work early on weekdays but end up staying up super late on weekends usually;;
yeah kind of the same. work days I wake up at 430am, and then my days off I stay up super late because i'm a night owl;;
Morning! <@311684705810513921>;;
how are you doing <@524820041976250368>;;
define super late <@416803598173995018>;;

<@311684705810513921> same. Love the night time. <@207416847019016202> lol it depends on how tired I am but usually 0300 or so? Compared to during the week when I go to bed around 2200;;

Breakfast sounds good <@311684705810513921> ;;

"especially when you said ""oh no... orange is here""";;
Lol I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre really good man. If you‚Äôre half as funny on stream as you are here, then it‚Äôs definitely good content;;
I'm not really funny at all <@416803598173995018> ;;
<@537319907541516311> writes all my stuff here on discord;;

And he sells KY jelly for a living! That's a job? Such a lucky man!;;

Open your window <@498246547838992414> ;;
Orange is outside waiting...;;
Oh, okay;;

<@409836692158021632> I also enjoyed it a lot. Russian grade content !;;
What up <@311684705810513921> ?;;
God damn, there is no way ima catch up with chat. There is like 2000 lines since I left this morning. I almost got a panick attack trying to read this;;
russian grade? is it bad?;;
Good day all;;
Do you think Russia is bad <@207416847019016202> ?;;

<@348165887347523594> I thought u were a kebab man?;;
That‚Äôs awesome! <@488734758847905803>;;
leaky dongle itis haha;;

I can almost see y our dongle in that pic <@348165887347523594> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
<@537319907541516311>üòÇ üòÇ , not today brother;;
The one I‚Äôm going to see is about 30min from me. I have 2 here in Texas one in Missouri;;
<@488734758847905803>;;
<@416803598173995018>lool;;
ah true that;;
OOOH <@524820041976250368> Where In Texas are you from? I recently visited Houston. ne of the best holidays I have ever had! We saw the Texans play at the NRG stadium.;;
Good job <@!537319907541516311>, your dongle just grew to 6!;;
Oh wow that‚Äôs awesome! I live about 2 hours from Houston! <@537319907541516311>;;
oh shit <@537319907541516311> for realsies?;;
why dont you come to Sao Paulo and I'll take you to a Palmeiras game;;
Amazing place. The heat was RIDICULOUS! Not used to that being from England. lol;;
<@488734758847905803> I want to visit Brazil, I just don't enjoy getting shot. How safe is it where u r?;;
Where I am is better than Rio haha;;
not that that says much;;
I mean, i've never been shot;;
and I've lived here for 15 years;;
Heat gets pretty crucial here lol;;
It gets hot as hell here too during the later summer;;
But it's a big city in Brzil <@537319907541516311>;;
like August and September;;
So, in general, youre good if you stay in the better locations. Paulista, Itaim Bibi, places l ike that;;
it's fairly rare for stuff to happen in the good neighborhoods because cops patrol those areas better;;
can't have crimes happening against the rich you know;;
What happens when the cops are corrupt? lol;;
They are corrupt <@416803598173995018>;;
but they know they;ll get shit if the rich get fucked;
Lol. No worries <@488734758847905803> Its only coz my step-mother is from Brasilia and she tells us never to go. lol;;
ah;;
brasilia is fine, just boring af;;
also, is she rich?;;
I have heard that before.;;
because rich people have this sense that everything is so dangerous;;
She is ok - She is a robotic scientist;;
because they spend all day watching daytime tv about crimes;;
yeah she be rich for our standards haha;;
like, i'm middle class here;;
I dont make a lot of money, and still I am in the richest 15% of the country;;
Sao Paulo is the richest state;;
so, a big cut of that 15% is here;;
Its a shame coz Brazilians are such lovely people in my experience - apart from Neymar.;;
<@488734758847905803> ahh ok;;
lmao <@537319907541516311> except for Neymar;;
NExt time I see him I'm going to flick booger at him. Booger covered in saliva, and ketchup;;
lol he is annoying to watch. I hate how he always fakes injuries and rolls around etc. He's a little dongle;;
Completely. An embarrassment to the Brazilian pride and heritage. And his hair style is shit.;;
I mean at least Brasil wins world cups though....cant say the same about the English...;;
Agreed. Don't get me started on them. That's why I'm glad I am of Portuguese heritage. Portugal all they way!!;;
ahh yes I forgot your Portuguese too. Whens the last time they won?;;
Well they won the last Euros against France - in France - as the underdogs - without Ronaldo;;
ahh ok, I dont follow the Euros so much. I love the world cup, was super happy that France won this year;;
last year I mean;;
yeah i hate neymar <@537319907541516311>;;
he used to be great when he played for Santos;;
Wasnt there a kid on the Brasil team last year who was living on the streets and his dream was to play for them? I thought I read something like that, great story;;
Also 7-1 <@488734758847905803>;;
Gabriel Jesus;;
he's from the youth divisions of Palmeiras <@416803598173995018> , thats my team.;;
and fok u;;
haha;;
Oh damn thats really cool;;
lol yeah yeah, Germans can never let that joke die. This past year my cousin sent me a pic of a supermarket special. They had a pack of 7 german sausages and one brasilian one lol;;
lmao;;
the fuckers;;
I mean, they lost in the first round though so lol;;
That was so embarrassing. My uncle was so mad, they've never lost in the first round before;;
lmao yeah I can imagine;;
brazil only lost in thte first round in 66;;
with Pele;;
the portuguese fucks injured him on purpose;;
Yeah my family over there was not happy, I wasnt either but at least France won so I was happy about that;;
Oh by the way everyone, I found out I'm part Russian so <@207416847019016202> is my cousin now;;

<@348165887347523594> get some for meeeee lmao;;
<@416803598173995018> for real, they are so much more expensive in France;;
<@488734758847905803> Haha;;
Yeah I wanted a nice pair of wing tips when I visited France, just looking at prices of them made me lose money;;
hahaha;;
<@416803598173995018>üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;
I believe you;;
I'm going to show the hell off when I'll get back;;
The cheaper end of shoes were around 100 euros lol;;
Lol yeah those blue nikes are really nice;;
Lol i got a pair last year for 80 euros;;
damn thats expensive lol;;
Yeah it all starts at 80-100;;
You buy one, and you're broke until the next paycheck lol;;
lmao;;
Yep. 80 euros is by far the cheapest;;
Gamepass Announcement!;;
Alien isolation is soooooo good;;
omg I bought batman and alien isolation a few months ago and still havent played them;;
fuuuuuck;;
my moneeeyyyy;;
I bought the whole Batman series physical and Walking dead on sale;;
More moneyyu;;
fooooooooook;;
I never buy expensive clothes actually (Belgian standards);;
Still haven't played them;;
did you at least play the batman games <@455797717763883009> ?;;
ooooooh fooook;;
FML;;
I gave it to my nephew to play;;
‚Ç¨80 for shoes is standard here;;
Around that price;;
i see;;
Actually, everything is expensive here;;
well, now you dont need them anymore lol;;
true <@!498246547838992414>;;
Like my beloved jacket that I wear 24/7;;
Fokking expensive that;;
It's not even that warm;;
Or even comfortable;;
It just looks cool;;
lol I played the first batman, it was ok. Mango out here just wasting money on games hes not playing haha;;
Also, <@488734758847905803> do you think this profile pic is better than the last one I made, because I need change in my life, and I want to make a good logo kinda thing;;
I like this logo more than the previous one <@!498246547838992414>;;
<@416803598173995018> - I hate sales for that;;
I see a game that I know I want to play, and i buy it;;
because I was already waiting for batman to go on sale;;
and alien too;;
so when I saw them on sale, i was like;;
oh yeah boi;;
yeah thats a good logo <@!498246547838992414>;;
Thanks  <@416803598173995018> <@488734758847905803>;;
I want to make it myself for now;;
it looks cleaner;;
Yeah, with the white and more colour;;
lol I do that too I guess. Gotta get better at managing the games I buy and if I can play them. I make the mistake of buying too many games at once and then never playing half of them lol;;
Kinda looks like yours  <@488734758847905803>;;
Without the mango;;
lmao <@!498246547838992414>;;
I bought dragon quest xi in november <@416803598173995018>;;
still havent come close to playing;;
lol yep thats what happened to me and red dead, I think I bought that and call of duty at the same time and then barely touched red dead. I also dont touch call of duty anymore either lol. Should have learned my lesson with the last one and not bought this one;;
bo4 you mean?;;
yeah;;
I bought ww2 last year and it was so bad. Not sure what I was thinking buying B04 lol;;
Mainly bought it for blackout but that got old quick and I love zombies but the zombie modes and maps just arent the same as the old ones;;
damn;;
yeah, i used to like shooter campaigns;;
which is why I got the metro games and the first two wolfensteins;;
Yeah the new metro looks good and wolfenstein comes out later this year. I will probably pick both up when they go on sale;;
cyberpunk and FF7 remake are the 2 games I am looking forward to most out of all the games coming out in the next year;;
oh Doom eternal too;;
why are you assume that cyberpunk and ff7 will come out next year? <@416803598173995018> ;;
was there dates announcement?;;
next year? FF7?;;
keep your anxiety in check for tht one;;
FF7 will take another few years i guarantee it;;
I said in the next year lol;;
not specifically this year;;
Next year?;;
Lol;;
ah ok;;
most likely next year yeah lol;;
I want it this year;;
CP 77;;
Im just being hopeful you guys!;;
cyberpunk I think will come out next year;;
im sure none of that will not come out in next year <@416803598173995018>;;
NO;;
YOURE WRONG AND NOW YOURE GETTING SHIT BECAUSE I DISAGREEEEEEEEEEE;;
I'm hoping E3 announcement;;
dont you know how the internet works <@416803598173995018> ?;;
And September release like Spiderman;;
shut up <@207416847019016202> ! Youre crushing my dreams;;
for Cyberpunk?;;
yes i do <@416803598173995018>;;
I think cyberpunk might come out;;
but FF7 will take a while;;
and honestly, after seeing a  lot of people complain about KH3 and I saw the mess FFXV'sstory was;;
there was a samurai type game coming out this year too but I cant remember the name of it. Looked amazing;;
i'm preparing myself for disappointment;;
sekiro shadows die twice;;
and ghost of tsushima;;
both those games look AMAZING;;
ghost of tsusima? <@416803598173995018>;;
I want... no, i NEED them;;
<@416803598173995018> nO0b;;
lmao;;
fucking casual;;
dont you dare touch me with that casualness;;
Ghosts I think, its kinda like witcher 3 gameplay ish, right?;;
<@455797717763883009> dont hate;;
<:PM:539114910211112995> <:SM:539114909179314217> <:PM:539114910211112995> <:GM:539114910362107915> <:PM:539114910211112995> <:PLM:539114906147094558>;;
yeah <@416803598173995018> that's ghost;;
ok cool, yeah cant fucking wait for that either;;
days gone looks promising also;;
Yeah that's the next one I'm excited for;;
Anything in between?;;
not sure, when does days gone come out?;;
April 26;;
oh devil may cry could be good;;
thats march 8th for devil so thats before days;;
Heard there's a lot of microtransactions;;
fuck really?;;
I thought capcom didnt do microtransactions;;
well yeah, im pretty sure dmc will have micros;;
its kinda talked a lot;;
that sucks;;
I havent played one of those games since the 3rd one;;
cyberpunk is #1 for me though. I cant wait for that game;;
same;;
excluding FF7;;
i totally agree and i wait for cyberpunk so much, but i can wait, no problems;;
yeah I cant wait, cause I know the more time they put into it, the better of a game it will be;;
cd projekt doesnt make bad games also so;;
Yeah. When I miss it I just put the trailer on loop;;
FF7 is gonna be a trip to play <@488734758847905803>;;
that was probably the first game I ever got obsessed with;;
that and ocarina of time;;
wait, i thought you said you never played FF7;;
No I played the shit out of that game lol;;
I quit because I had two games going, one where I was just before sepiroth and I wrote over it with the other one where I was very early in the game by accident so I stop playing it cause I was so upset with myself and never played it again;;
Any idea when Ori is dropping?;;
Also After Party;;
And Sable;;
Fuckers release the good games <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;

Yea <@207416847019016202> I know it's that Americans are used to this form of interaction. You say that state, unless you are from a big recognizable city. ;;
;;
Americans  aren't used to saying the country first, then the state when they meet someone from another country. Unless they have lived overseas long like <@488734758847905803> and me. I always say America or USA first, then if they ask what state I say it.;;
yeah i got it <@345380744375566338> ;;
thanks;;
im not against that, but when somebody saying where he is from, i alwas think that he said his country;;
that's how I do it as well <@345380744375566338> I just say Canada because most people don't know our Provinces anyways lol;;
i know ontario and yukon !;;
because company i work in, tends to call software products we develop, with canada states names;;
<@207416847019016202> make the world great again;;
I say France, than Martinique cause no one knows Martinique or actually knows it's a state of France.;;
Yesterday again someone asked me on Twitch what was our currency;;
i know now <@348165887347523594>  <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
<@207416847019016202> yep ;);
and what is your currency again? <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;

I know no one knows, and actually I probably only know certain capitals of foreign countries.;;
I know Moscow is the capital of Russia, but I don't know any state of Russia;;
Fuck, it sucks that we can't edit our posts on discord's chat;;
we can;;
i always do that;;
Ho shit, well I just found out.;;
Lol;;
"well russia ""states"" mostly called by name of biggest city. Like ""Moscow Region"" for example";;
Ok;;
Ok all, I'm going to find some sleep. Tomorrow morning I'm taking the plane to Jamaica to visit a branch of my family I have never met yet. The Cuban side that immigrated there before migrating to the United States during the difficult year. I'm excited. So @everyone If we don't get a chance to speak tomorrow know that I miss you already.  Much love;;

all y ou have to do is find my like.. 5 ex gf's;;
though some of them might go crazy if you mention my name and send you antrhax in the mail;;
it's hard work finding a girlfriend with such an insignificant dongle;;
yeah i totally understand you. finding gf with a dongle is not easy;;
lamo;;
lmao*;;
wow hahaha;;
that took an unexpected turn;;
is what my ex gf said to me when she whipped out her dongle;;
and turned me around;;
üò≠;;
so basically, did all of your exes had dongles?;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> üå∂;;
why your dongle is red? go see a doctor <@409836692158021632>;;
sorry...;;
right away, Dr. Orange!;;
real doctor;;
dongle doctor;;
ok.;;
i specialize only in fixing hate;;
I'll schedule an appointment with Dr. Mango.;;
Dr. Mango is very jelaous of other dongles, so he can do something bad with yours;;
so dont go to him either;;
hmmm okay...;;
I'll shrink that dongle right up <@409836692158021632>;;
üòÉ;;
üôÑ if you can find it;;
<@488734758847905803>  when mark arrives to your appointment, ask him about daughter;;
and you will get guaranteed 3 hours of work;;
lmao;;
haha;;
"hey, I'm improving! she called me a ""decent father"" today";;
im pretty sure it was some young people slang you dont get <@409836692158021632>;;
ah gotcha. that makes more sense.;;
ahahahahahaha;;
you should be a therapist, Orange;;
or do an advice segment on your stream...;;
Orange fixes your weak life...;;
"Me: ""Orange, what can I do to make my daughter like me?""";;
"Orange: ""Nothing. Next question.""";;
but first Orange needs to persuad you that your life is weak;;
Ask Orange Anything;;
"no, it would be more like ""Orange: ""Nothing. No more weak questions.""""";;
hahahaha;;
please ban that caller;;
exactly;;
Life advice from OneMansOrange...;;
all your answers will be;;
you suck;;
eff you;;
next question;;
<@409836692158021632> should be editor of my podcast;;
you should actually right me lines and jokes;;
because you are perfect;;
hahaha;;
Sucking With Friends Podcast;;
exactly;;
"or maybe ""hating with friends""";;
"or better ""hating friends""";;
lol Id listen to that podcast;;
better with hate;;
youd participate <@416803598173995018>;;
I mean obviously, I have the radio voice already;;
yeah;;
Honestly, I think a podcast with all of us would be amazing;;
not joking at all;;
cast decided, we only need <@409836692158021632>  to write lines;;
sounds good to me;;
mark we need some good jokes please;;
jokes? okay. let me look at my life...;;
honestly though, you don't need any written jokes, Orange;;
you're very entertaining the way you are;;
i want all of you to love me for my personality, not for funny accent lol;;
I love you for your salty humor;;
what accent are you talking about?;;
okay you are forgiven;;
cant say same about the rest;;
you need to keep practicing your Russian accent though...;;
don't worry...you'll get there;;

https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-02-21-crackdown-3-crash-lands-to-under-gbp30-already;;
Im assuming its not a good game? lol <@455797717763883009>;;
Haha it's not;;
haha i assumed it before release;;
im lucky assumer;;
I just pre-ordered Days Gone;;
What's your assumption on that  <@207416847019016202>;;
oof that sucks <@455797717763883009>;;
I was hoping Crackdown 3 would do well;;
Yeah, glad I tried it on Gamepass;;
Was fun for 2-3 hours;;
Then it got super repetitive and was bland the whole way;;
Ive never even heard of crackdown I dont think lol;;
<@455797717763883009> I see you like to live life on the edge by pre-ordering lol;;
Which rock you living under   <@416803598173995018>;;
Haha the last Days Gone trailer looked like it had a story to tell;;
Maybe I have heard of it but it's a game Id have no interest in so I possibly just dont remember it lol;;
I like stories;;
And haven't played a zombie game in a long time;;
i myself interested in days gone, but since i dont own ps4, and my brother who owns it, not interested in days gone, i think i will wait and see.;;
and to be honest im afraid that game will fail <@455797717763883009>;;
at least, it will not become icon like last of us or something;;
I want a left for dead remake personally;;
Of course not expecting an iconic game;;
Just a decent story and playtime;;
Rising that bike could be fine. Give me a Ghost Rider skin and I'll be a happy man;;
to be honest i kinda get turned off by that sea of zombies. too arcade/shooting style for me;;
but i presume story can be interesting;;
Yeah, also the bike part makes it interesting;;
only zombie game that i played, and liked - dying light;;
I'll just try to run away;;
Oh yeah, Waiting for Dying Light 2;;
well i guess last of us zombie game too...;;
yeah, maybe  Dying Light 2 is closest game im waiting for;;
Clickerss;;
Good job <@!455797717763883009>, your dongle just grew to 15!;;
Wohoo;;
I thought the combat in dying light was bad, thats the only thing I didnt like about it;;
damn <@455797717763883009> do you like the Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider or the Nick Cage version?;;
Kinda disappointing though, the first quarter of 2019 releases;;
i dont care about combat in any game, its all bad for me, i would prefer that games without combat;;
what exactly is disappointing? personally i didnt wait any of it from the start;;
The Cage one  <@409836692158021632>;;
I mean, last year was great;;
haha;;
Especially Q4;;
lol yeah thats where we differ <@207416847019016202>;;
Spiderman, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Odyssey, Red Dead;;
im pretty sure a lot of people didnt like tomb raider;;
but i agree, Q4 was good;;
I didnt like spider man either. Regret buying that game;;
Not as good as Rise. But it was good;;
but i didnt expect anything from Q1;;
Especially that difficulty mode;;
<@416803598173995018> because of the repetitiveness?;;
Exactly. Fighting and everything else got stale so quickly for me;;
I played for a week and then stopped cause I was so bored with it;;
i cant say anything bad about shadow of tomb raiderm because i didnt play it, i stil didnt finish rise <@455797717763883009> ;;
but you know, stupid me though that 3rd one will be something like what witcher 3 was in comparison to witcher 1 and 2. and apparently it wasnt;;
so for me it just killed trilogy;;
I enjoyed each part equally;;
But Rise was better in how the story was conveyed;;
<@416803598173995018> didn't finish it?;;
Nope, havent played it since lol;;
Lol;;
I need to not be so impulsive buying games now lol;;
Haha I think it's the best Spiderman story though;;
yeah I've heard its good, I just cant force myself to like it lol. I wish I did like it but I just dont;;
i can force you if you want <@416803598173995018>;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Lol no I‚Äôll pass;;
okay, but my offer stands;;
You will have to come to LA to do it though so;;
yeah, I agree with <@416803598173995018> about spiderman;;
I loved free roaming;;
loved the graphics;;
<@416803598173995018> just watch the cut scenes on YouTube;;
but the story and the combat kinda sucked imo;;
I felt the combat was sooo repetitive;;
thanks, no LA for me <@416803598173995018>;;
lol I figured <@207416847019016202> so I am safe here for now;;
Yeah combat was super repetitive;;
I could close my eyes and do combos and get through it;;
Jump swing, throw webs. Shock those fuckers, grab manhole cover and throw and repeat;;
exactly <@455797717763883009>;;
and that turned me off;;
But nonetheless was fun swinging around NY;;
And finding Easter eggs;;
Almost had tears near the climax;;
true true;;
I was gonna make a climax joke;;
but now <@467974634977886220> is here and she doesnt get those;;
BOOM;;
pun intended;;
swinging around NY was fun, but not 50 hours worth of it lol;;
lol <@488734758847905803>;;
I‚Äôm good just tired. Lol <@488734758847905803>;;

<@278571432588345345> , what's the final word on Anthem now that the new patch is out?;;
Howdy all;;
hey <@502117016748949526> how goes it today?;;
it's a bit quiet here;;
Pretty good. Just hanging out;;
Was playing Heroes of the Storm and League of Legends;;
But now my son hijacked the computer so he could stream Fortnite with his buddies LOL;;
haha;;
Fortnite is the devil;;
JK;;
hey <@502117016748949526> !;;
how are you buddy?;;
lmao;;
fortnite is the worst;;
LOL. It‚Äôs my own fault. I introduced him to the game LOL;;
though I heard LoL is doing better now;;
Hey <@488734758847905803>;;
because so many toxic kids are on fortnite;;
I used to be sooooo addicted to LoL;;
Hey <@488734758847905803> sorry for the quiet. I finally did my dental procedure;;
Higher than a kite;;
no probs <@272988530278662146> !;;
don't worry about it;;
oh shit really?;;
I hate getting high from meds and stuff;;
<@488734758847905803> I like it. But I think Heroes is more well polished. Too bad they nerfed the support for it;;
I don't even drink alcohol;;
was it pretty bad though, the procedure?;;
<@488734758847905803> Neither do I;;
Its rough man. I got to. I woke up during my procedure...;;
<@502117016748949526> - i saw a friend of mine play it and I didnt feel drawn to it for some reason;;
WHAAAT;;
It was.. scary to say the least;;
you woke up?!;;
Yep;;
Good job <@!272988530278662146>, your dongle just grew to 7!;;
Good old America health care;;
Oof;;
What did u have done?;;
Sadly this is where I wish I was joking;;
3 of my wisdom teeth removed along with 3 broke teeth;;
All removed;;
Yikes;;
I woke up while they was removing the next to last tooth;;
That happened to me when they were doing one of my ear surgeries;;
American health care is the worsttttttt;;
Don‚Äôt remember much other than seeing everyone in the room;;
All I remember was waking up and feeling something pressing down on my gum and the lady just looked at me;;
She was like uhhhh...;;
Your not supposed to be awake;;
Do you smoke?;;
They gave me more stuff. It nummed most of it but I could hear;;
No!!!;;
oh damn that is horrifying;;
It seems to happen more frequently with smokers;;
<@416803598173995018> My daughter‚Äôs a nurse...watch it there, buddy LOL;;
Good job <@!502117016748949526>, your dongle just grew to 2!;;

Damn;;
Ok gotta go play with the kids. So long guys;;

<@502117016748949526> I saw that wrong, health care as in insurance lol. Nurses, doctors, EMTS and paramedics are amazing. Apologies;;
Hope you all are having a fantastic evening!;;
You too! <@524820041976250368> ';;
How‚Äôre you? <@416803598173995018>;;

Good! <@524820041976250368> Just started my stream. I thought the new operators had come out for Rainbow Six but not for another 2 weeks I think so Im just playing apex again;;
Alrighty I‚Äôll be there! <@416803598173995018>;;
I have been having problems with audio tho so there‚Äôs times it freezes I think it‚Äôs my phone lol ugh;;
Thanks! Appreciate it, hope the issues arent too bad or work out;;

Alright I‚Äôll be there! <@488734758847905803>;;
The patch has not changed much <@488734758847905803> . Anthem is flawed in story, dialogue, menus, loading screens, hub, mission structure, progression, etc. But it is a lot of fun to play imo and especially if you have a couple people to squad up. Hard to recommend at full price honestly;;
oh well if it isn't the best discord on this side of the Milky Way.;;
what's up <@535295021482508299> how was work?;;
just getting settled in for the night.  10 hours to go! hahahahakillmehahaha;;

I'd like to play something fun for viewers to watch;;
hahaha;;
honestly, I for one can never chat with viewers that well when playing shooters;;
yeah same I am way too focused. I had my first raid during a tense Apex battle. 4 minutes. 4 minutes passed before I realized haha;;
omg that sucks haha;;
thats why i prefer story games;;

What platform you on? <@535295021482508299>;;

i said youre lucky assumer, and i meant that you assumed correctly;;
its just i realised that my laptop doesnt work (after i walked with it couple hours in a cold haha);;
It's DrDisrespect;;
so ive been busy mourning it;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;

<@312379820933906442> same man, life gets in the way;;
<@416803598173995018> it is what it is. i am only 20 years old so i have to do what i have to do;;
It gets better once youre done with school;;
unless youre like me and dont gooooo;;
then you have more time for streaming;;
yeah;;
no jk;;

<@416803598173995018> , he totally should;;
<@488734758847905803> i feel you man. I have a little more then a year left of school and then i graduate.;;
hopefully thats when i can start doing what im passionate about;;
Yeah it def makes a difference once you can get home and actually not study lol;;
<@312379820933906442> yeah man you're super young. Not old fucks like me and <@488734758847905803>;;
just working takes a helluva lot of time;;
yeah;;
I prefer to consider myself seasoned;;
lol;;
Seasoned means old;;
mango seasoned;;
hahahaha;;
You're old;;
like me;;
i was thinking that <@488734758847905803>;;
but not as old as Marklar lol;;
There are studies though that people are teenagers until theyre early 20's because of age increase and such;;
lmao;;
or <@207416847019016202>;;
that orange has got some mold on its stem;;
but yeah, i'm 28;;
still a while off before i turn 29 though;;
Nice try, I know youre 82;;
lmfao;;
I'm like pycelle from game of thrones;;
I get old but i still do lots of dongle play with whores and stuff;;
(no i dont <@467974634977886220> );;
lmao fuck I hate that guy;;
shhhh;;
same;;
you know someone I really like but eveyrone in my family absolutely hates?;;
the sparrow;;
like, I hate his religion and think its stupid;;
Im 32 but at least I am younger than Orange;;
but he's really true to what he believes in;;
yeah hes just annoying;;
and I love seeing Cersei's plans backfire;;
I think she's the character I despise the most;;
even though <@467974634977886220> thinks she's cool;;
i have to admit. this discord is the only discord that is super active a lot of the times that im apart of.;;
Shes awful, realllllly hope she dies this season lol;;
i appreciate you guys and this discord;;
that's awesome to hear <@312379820933906442> !;;
we do have an amazing community in here;;
got some great peeps;;
Thats good <@312379820933906442> this is a good discord, we are all pretty close and support each other;;
we appreciate you too dude :);;
We're glad youre a part of it;;
<@416803598173995018> - she probably will, Jamie will probs kill her;;
"there's a prophecy - ""the valankar will kill you"" (in  a nutshell of course, thats not the whole prophecy)";;
valankar means younger brother.;;
Jamie was born after Cersei;;
Jamie was born after her;;
does anybody play rocket league??? <@488734758847905803> <@416803598173995018>;;
yeah I think so too. Shes playing out the part of the mad king and Jamie will have to be a king slayer again;;
<@312379820933906442> No, sorry. Ive never played it;;
I do on ps4 <@312379820933906442> but i suuuck;;
yeah exactly <@416803598173995018>;;
i just bought it cause its only $12 right now;;
and it looks fun to play to be honest;;
i dont know if it'll be a romeu and juliet deal, but I think he might kill himself out of guilt;;
or hook up with Brienne;;
it is really fun <@312379820933906442>;;
Nah hes gonna kill himself;;
but it is literally one of hte only games that ever tilted me;;
Tormund better hook up with Brienne;;
and make giant babies;;
hahaah;;
they won't, I guarantee it;;
well, at least in the books that won't happen;;
DONT YOU SAY THAT;;
i'm sorry;;
I 100% guarantee that won't happen;;
I wanna believe in that love story;;
jamie and brienne is a better love story;;
SHUT YOUR WHORE MOUTH;;
lmfaooooo;;

Tormund and Brienne for life;;

No way;;
Tormund is such a horndog;;
I mean, dont get me wrong;;
Yeah I love him haha;;
I got his funko pop;;

Podrick and the whores is the best love story though;;
lol thats awesome;;
lmfao yeah true that;;
The one I really wanted though was the hound;;
but of course, he's lke 200 dollars or whatever;;

Fuck I cant wait for the new season. I hope HBO is working on their servers cause that shit is gonna crash when the first episode comes out;;
https://www.amazon.com/Funko-POP-Game-Thrones-Figure/dp/B009B10YWI - look at this bs;;
geez that much? God damn;;

what time is your stream today <@416803598173995018> ???;;
Im going to try and go live around 315-330;;
PM;;
nice! I'll be there!;;
Awesome, thanks man!;;
Gotta get hype for the sub emote;;
Gonna spam it up lol;;
also, did you have any trouble uploading the emotes? ;;
I heard there's been some difficulty uploading the 28 x 28 ones for some people;;
It gave me some errors at first but I got it eventually;;
ah ok. so it's a common Twitch thing;;
you're welcome, my dude! glad to help!;;
also, I saw this rumor that Tier 1 might get 2 emotes in the future;;
one streamer was able to do it yesterday but he thinks it was a mistake on Twitch's part;;
Oh damn thats cool, Im still thinking of what to do for a tier 3 emote lol;;
guys! it's official!;;
starting today, Affiliates that have 15 subscribers unlock a 2nd emote slot!;;
here's the official announcement:;;
https://blog.twitch.tv/partner-and-affiliate-emote-update-e724563f830f;;
oh that's awesome!!;;
Nice!;;
More work for you <@409836692158021632> lol;;
hahaha;;
wait...why am I laughing;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> `weak americans need 2 emotes...Orange only need 1 strong emote`;;
What should I do? I have someone I mod for that seems to be getting jealous that I support other streamers and not just them, I need input? any opinions are welcome!;;
<@524820041976250368> - I honestly feel like that person is being very selfish;;
"that's like your friend saying ""You cant be friends with other people because youre my friend""";;
<@524820041976250368> ;;
just be honest with them. modding takes time out of YOUR schedule. you're not obligated to do it.;;
they are LUCKY to even have you mod their channel.;;
I honestly do not like that person's attitude of getting jealous and that shows something about their character.;;
they should be happy and THANKFUL for you helping them.;;
I would stop modding for them if they're gonna be selfish and possessive like that;;
what <@409836692158021632> said is better articulated than what I said even;;
I def agree with that;;
I agree with you bothüíú y‚Äôall are the best! I just don‚Äôt like how this person is making me feel, I absolutely love supporting streamers. And yes being a mod for them does take time out of my schedule but I enjoy mod‚Äôing. I think he‚Äôs just getting jealous cause while I‚Äôm mod‚Äôing I still support other streamers by posting them to my twitter or jumping in there chat to say hi.;;
you don't owe the person anything for moding though.;;
modding*;;
like, it's very possessive of them;;
and borderline creepy;;
That would be like me getting jealous that <@207416847019016202> or <@348165887347523594> are in other people's streams or supporting other streamers;;
it's crazy;;
I am at a loss for words at how ridiculous that is lol;;
dont mean to diss on your friend, sorry;;
but that's just me  being honest;;
I've DM'd you this a bunch of times already <@524820041976250368> ;;
we love and appreciate all the support you do! all the lurking, watching, chatting and tweeting!;;
every little bit helps since streamers start out on a very lonely road in the beginning ;;
but with people like you there, you make it more fun AND you make the community a much much better place to be in;;
I suggest stop modding for this person and take his attitude as an example of who you should NOT mod for;;
I bow to <@409836692158021632> 's words;;
man is wise;;
probably cause of his age;;
(sorry for the free burn);;
I dub thee Dongle Master;;
Haha <@488734758847905803> it‚Äôs cool I understand what your sayingüíú and <@409836692158021632> I really appreciate that! Doing all those things for all of you is what makes me me I really appreciate all of you;;
uhhhh...thanks I guess... <@488734758847905803> ;;

What are you going to do in Dubai when you're there? <@207416847019016202>;;
i think mostly a lot of walking around;;
like, all the time;;
walking around = scoping out the targets;;
is there a lot to see there? I dont know anything about the city;;
lol <@409836692158021632>;;
<@409836692158021632> this is your last warning;;
<@416803598173995018> it depends on what you consider interesting to see. we just love walk around cities we are in, almost any city has something interesting;;

I didn't want it to get denied or anything;;
and after emote got approved you continued to freaking out about something else? <@409836692158021632>;;
at my old age I freak out about everything <@207416847019016202>;;
ok, done with work and am ready to party;;
question for you guys,;;
<:PM:539114910211112995> <:PM:539114910211112995> <:PM:539114910211112995>;;
I am thinking about changing my stream schedule;;
and start a little earlier;;
I'd start at around 8am PST;;
1pm EST;;
6pm London time;;
9pm moscow time;;
Dope;;
Sounds good;;
Which days of the week?;;
if <@278571432588345345> approves, i need no more;;
Lol;;
Indeed;;
monday, wednesday, thursday and friday;;
Nice;;
weekends will be more sporadic.;;
since daylights saving ended here in brazil, i figured i'd also change my schedule;;
They're rolling out more emote slots for affiliates;;
yeah I saw;;
Good job <@!488734758847905803>, your dongle just grew to 30!;;
that's awesome;;
woooooooooooooooo;;
One extra slot at 15 subs, 2 more at 25 up to 5 at 50+ subs;;
that's awesome;;
I think I have 10 right now, i'm not sure;;
probably lost a bunch since I barely streamed this month;;
It takes the max youve had;;

but I will stream for 4-5 hours every day;;
@everyone - time for question of the day again.;;
this is something I used to do more, but then stopped, but want to pick up again cause I love hearing about you guys.;;
;;
What story, be it in a game, movie , show or even a song, do you feel like the story was about you in some way or another?;;
you know, that you felt truly related to the story in general;;
bit of a difficult question for sure, but I felt kinda like that with FFX.;;
I had just moved to brazil when I played it, I didn't know how to speak the language,and felt like Tidus. in a new world, without friends or anything;;
Final Fantasy X-2. I always feel like 3 hot girls;;
lmfaoooooooo;;

I‚Äôm playing a lot of apex, rocket league and fifa at the mo. But I love RPG‚Äôs. wishing I could wipe my memory and play Witcher 3 again;;
omg same about the witcher <@548636104975187970>;;
I used to try to be a full-on fifa pro <@548636104975187970>;;
I really did;;
hey <@548636104975187970> !!!;;
only made it to the semis though;;
i suck at shooters and rocket league;;
I‚Äôm reasonable on fifa but certainly not a pro.;;
what's your team of choice?;;
Rocket league I‚Äôm terrible but I have a laugh;;
for support and for games;;
mine is Palmeiras (im sure youll know them if youre a man u fan);;
I support Man U, but I watch a lot of Cardiff as my wife is from there. Was at the game tonight;;
oh cool;;
I kinda hate man u because of that infamous 99 match;;
I mean, theyre awesome;;
but I hate them lol;;
Lol;;
Good job <@!548636104975187970>, your dongle just grew to 1!;;
99 was a good year for us;;
yeah it was;;
no one outside brasil cares about that match <@488734758847905803>;;
it could have been a great year for us too lmao;;
he cares <@207416847019016202> He careeeeeeeees;;
he is a man u fan;;
not so much as you, when you go sleep and cry;;
I‚Äôm glad we have ole in charge. Takes me back to when I was 13;;
I mean, how not to cry?;;
we were supposed to be world champions;;
true that <@548636104975187970> haha;;
im pretty sure you was supposed to be nothing <@488734758847905803>;;
To be fair, we have been a shadow of our former selves for a long time;;
yeah, with all the money rolling in Chelsea and Man City;;
Hate Jos√©;;
Arsenal and Man U have not been doing too hot;;
Pogba is my boy;;
mourinho?;;
yeah, he's a douche.;;
Yeah;;
hey hey, isnt MU like, one of the reachest in the world? they just doesnt spend so much, but they gain a lot <@488734758847905803>;;
"<@488734758847905803> about the QOTD, I'd say the song ""If I die young"" by The band Perry";;
they haven't been as rich for a while, no <@207416847019016202> ?;;
i think they still are;;
lmao <@498246547838992414>;;

The Glazers have been tight with money;;
I'll listen to the song and;;
I'm not kidding, those lyrics hit me hard;;
To be fair we‚Äôve made some questionable signings;;

daddy orange <@498246547838992414> üòÇ;;
where? <@488734758847905803>;;
pogba played for MU before;;
but he wasnt in their youth divisions was he?;;
well he got in MU in 16;;
so basically they had him young and they sold him to buy again for shit ton;;
lmao didnt know that;;
This song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NJqUN9TClM;;
I love it so much;;
Think Pogba went to Bobby Charlton‚Äôs soccer school;;
oh damn;;
Charlton is hated by some brazilian players;;
I think he hit Pele or someone in the face;;
Bobby Charlton is a national treasure;;
very chill song <@498246547838992414>;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o3RN7-7ijw reminded me a bit of this for some reason;;

hey guys i am live right now for a little bit if you want to come hangout üòâ;;
i want to meet some new people;;
Sorry <@312379820933906442> I just saw this. I would have stopped by, be there next time!;;

In 15 minutes my plane will take off  <@416803598173995018>;;
Damn I thought you were already traveling there lol;;
And then it will be 6 hours of flight;;
Oh that‚Äôs not bad, that‚Äôs short;;
That's okay for Russia;;
I used to travel 8-9 hours;;
Yeah that‚Äôs about the time it takes me to go home to Boston. Going to Europe last year it was about 11 hours total flight time;;
Captain says it will be 5 hours;;
That's good;;
That‚Äôs not long at all. 2 movies and you‚Äôre there;;
Haha I agree;;
When I said to landsby that flight to st petersburg is 1.40, he responded like wow, Yeah, Russia s big;;
I guess he meant that for Europe 2 hours flight is huge;;
But for me it's shortest flight in my life;;
Lol yeah that‚Äôs short. Shortest flight for me was 45 minutes. LA to San Fransisco;;
I can't even imagine flight like this in russia;;
Maybe there is, but it's rare;;

Morning everyone;;
Morning!;;
Morning! <@87241615671832576> <@217089479863697418>;;
How are you guys?;;
I‚Äôm good!;;
I am good,  just have had a couple of rough days with my project management course. So I've not had the energy to stay around;;
Hope things get betterüíú;;
It does, the book have just been through a translation, which feels like Google translator, so after a reading session my head feels like it's been in a wrench to try and comprehend what it tried to tell me;;
Ahh sorry to hear that;;
It's okay :);;
Hey <@217089479863697418> !;;
Hey <@87241615671832576> ;;
I hate poorly translated works;;
Hey <@524820041976250368>;;
Lmao <@416803598173995018>;;
Hey! <@488734758847905803>;;
I hope you hate that <@488734758847905803>;;
And yeahh I'd preferred everything just being  English as ther terminology is more logical like that. I hate jumping hoops because of jumping hoops;;
How are you <@524820041976250368> ?;;
What's in store  for the weekend?;;
<@87241615671832576> yeah, it really irks me. ;;
I actually did a translation and the client was challenging my translations. I have no problem with that of course, but her arrogance really pissed me off. It got to the point where she was saying that what I said was wrong, which I denied, and she asked for an explanation. ;;
Not wanting to ever work with her again, I told her that English classes were charged separately;;
But yeah jumping through hoops just for the sake of it is a waste of time;;
I get that one for sure.;;
It was the first time in my life that I snapped at a client since becoming a freelancer in 2014;;
Well, a full-time one at least;;
But anyway, what's your course about?;;
Or whatever you're reading;;
I get the frustration if the doubt about the work are not rooted I  anything.;;
It's called PRINCE2 project management. It's basically just about how to lead projects.;;
I've been doing it for years, but never had the dam  piece of paper, so I hope it'll help out to find a job;;
I‚Äôm alright, just watching streamsüíú <@488734758847905803>;;
Follow the NerdyHeart for all the great streams :);;
Haha üíú I do tend to find some amazing streamers lol;;
So what's has been the best stream this week?;;
All of them!;;
Haha okay :);;
I can‚Äôt just pick one cause all the ones I‚Äôve watched were great!;;
True, I was more thinking if there had been a highlight where something really special happened;;
Oh haha I like when orange sings in his streams those are the best;;
Just got a win without <@537319907541516311> ....what does that say? Lol;;
Both my teammates died right at the end and I had to kill 2 people lol. Was so stressful;;
Ah true <@87241615671832576> ;;
I know that feeling of not having proof of knowledge;;
Damn <@416803598173995018>;;
I think we gotta cut <@537319907541516311>;;
But he‚Äôs just so damn charming. I can‚Äôt stand mad at him lol;;
God damn though this game gets my heart going lol;;
Why are you up so early? <@488734758847905803>;;
<@524820041976250368> orange singing is the best lol;;
I was wondering the same thing? <@488734758847905803> lol;;
And yes! Have you seen fiddler on the roof? <@416803598173995018>;;
Years ago yeah;;
I absolutely love that movie and when he sings that‚Äôs what he reminds me ofüíú;;
Lol ohh ok. Yeah I can see that haha;;
I‚Äôve clipped him singing lol. It was so good;;
He‚Äôs just got that great make you feel good and wanna dance toon haha;;
That‚Äôs awesome!;;
Lol yeah he does haha. He has so much fun doing it;;
Yes it‚Äôs awesome I love it. He argues with me about his singing tho it‚Äôs funny;;
That's good to hear üòÑ;;
Yes! I hope your morning is going well;;
I am just sitting and thinking I want to play something. but i don't know what to play;;
Sounds fun I‚Äôm just sitting here watching streams and wanting to kick my cousins assüòÇ;;
Morning folks üêº;;
Morning! <@455797717763883009>;;
why kicking ass?;;
And what stream are you watching?;;
Morning <@524820041976250368> how's your weekend?;;
ThePurTyDirTy he‚Äôs doing a 24 hour stream. <@87241615671832576> and cause he‚Äôs out cheating on his gf and I don‚Äôt put up with cheaters;;
My weekend is good! How‚Äôs yours? <@455797717763883009>;;
So you don't watch him anymore now?;;
Saturday morning, just woke up!;;
Lol  <@87241615671832576> I think she meant her cousin;;
Ohh;;
Yes my cousin is the one cheating;;
I get that now;;
Pull his hears;;
It‚Äôs currently 3:08 am hereüòÇ <@455797717763883009>;;
Oh wow;;
10am here;;
Such a lazy Saturday already;;
I think something more harsh this isn‚Äôt his first time doing it, I‚Äôm just pissed/upset cause I got close to his gf and now she‚Äôs going back to Oklahoma. <@87241615671832576>;;
And oh wow lol I‚Äôm so tired but not sleepy <@455797717763883009>;;
I get it <@524820041976250368>;;
I just hate getting close to people, I try to keep my distance but with as big of a heart I have for people it‚Äôs nearly impossible for me not to get attached <@87241615671832576>;;
yeahh, but also just the dishonesty and lack of respect for another person with cheating;;
it was something different if they had an agreement of an open relationship;;
I agree I told her she deserves better and that I want her to do what‚Äôs best for her, I‚Äôm not mad at her at all yes imma miss her but she‚Äôs gotta do what‚Äôs right for her. My cousin is really childish and he‚Äôs been babied all his life(19years) I don‚Äôt see him growing up anytime soon;;
nahh it normally would require something drastic to happen if he ever will;;
Right I agree and I don‚Äôt think he will ever learn but it is what it is, I won‚Äôt be nice to him anymore tho;;
I get it;;
I appreciate you listening and giving input üíú;;
np, I'm one of the dudes who was constantly cheated on, which made me not want to have a relationship for 10 years. Which is not that healthy either üòÑ;;
I understand that and am sorry you‚Äôve had to go thru that, I can‚Äôt stand cheaters and I won‚Äôt put up with themüòÇ;;
It's okay for me, I had 10 fun years, where I learned alot about myself.;;
Good job <@!87241615671832576>, your dongle just grew to 12!;;
Well that‚Äôs a plus! It‚Äôs always good getting to learn more about yourself (:;;
Yeahh it is üòÉ;;
I‚Äôm still working on it myself lol;;
Takes times and it's not like when you've figured it out it will be a static thing.;;
Right I know, you honestly learn new things about yourself everyday and you will always learn new things that‚Äôs what shapes everyone into themselves!;;
yup, we should all go away on a a trip around the world every 10th year;;
Yes haha;;
That would be awesome;;
it would, when I am done with having kids I need to do something aswell;;
For sure! I wish I had kids tho lol;;
except, when they are assholes;;
Morning guys;;
Morning  <@343707181377388544>!;;
How's your weekend?;;
Working just like every other weekend. How bout you?;;
Ah. I'm just starting this lazy Saturday with some AC Odyssey;;
Sounds like a good day already.;;
So okay, my plain again didn't crash, despite all <@488734758847905803> magic;;
I'm all good, in the hotel right now, about to go searching for food;;
Many thanks to fans of my singing  <@524820041976250368> <@416803598173995018>;;
Continue, and someday I will sing something haha;;
So where are you now ?;;
Dubai;;
I will send some photos later;;
But I like it here;;
It's an impressive cuty, even though i am not impressed of how it's built :);;
I hope you'll enjoy the stay man;;
Haha thanks;;
A lot of tall buildings <@207416847019016202> ?;;
A lot, but they spreader across city, so I need to go hunt for them  <@526319824704634881>;;
hunt for them.. when you say it like that it's sounds scary.. lmao;;
Good morning guys! Or night. Or afternoon or..;;
Hey <@535295021482508299> !;;
im back;;
<@526319824704634881> how argue pokato?;;
Morning everyone!;;
Good morning  <@524820041976250368> !;;
How‚Äôre you? <@535295021482508299>;;
I'm doing well, had a real good sleep for once haha you?;;
I slept a couple hours haha, I‚Äôm doing alright;;
Hey <@442488674144223242>  and <@524820041976250368> !!;;
Hey! <@526319824704634881> how‚Äôre you?;;
whats up all;;
Not much;;
What about you?;;
A little sick but good..playing tes legends, maybe apex, while waiting for Jonny to stream.. heheh;;
my laptop shat itself, got a spare while i wait for a new one;;
Aww I hope you feel better <@526319824704634881> and oh wow <@442488674144223242> sorry to hear that;;
üëÄ;;
work pays for it so its not that bad, just a pain in the ass more than anythin;;
Ah okay lol;;
<@526319824704634881> welcome to the card nerd family;;
Nooooo;;
too late <@526319824704634881>;;
**uninstalling;;
**uninstalling discord too;;
Cat heard family?;;
yep, you almost read it right;;
what i want to say straight away after short walk around dubai.;;
"when you walking around moscow downtown, you almost never will encounter problem like ""where should i go to go around this huge highway""";;
because there is always convinient roads for pedestrians and such;;
but here in many situations its totally not clear where you need to go as a pedestrian;;
because so many huge roads and so less pedestrian walkaways;;
The city are made for cars, so technically you are doing it wrong.;;
And are you there for work or pleasure <@207416847019016202>;;
well you know many russians say that comparing to st petersburg, moscow made for cars;;
but that is bullshit;;
so hope is in me still about dubai too;;
But Moscow and St. Petersburg are cities creates before cars, so I'd argue there's big parts of the cities which are made for pedestrians. Unless theywhere burned down or all the cultural important landmarks was erased.;;
yeah i see what you mean;;
tour guide said the same thing to us;;
that bus and metro are cool, but they not convinient, so everybody has cars or ride taxi;;
It does make sense and I guess they don't have a huge tradition of public transportation;;
yep;;
they dont;;
coll i meant in technology way;;
i cant wait to checkut their metro;;
i love metro usually;;
Indeed, I love the metro in Berlin. It has such a nice smell;;
The one in Copenhagen are just boring in all regards;;
Well don't know about that metros, but moscow one is really convinient;;
One day I should try and go there;;
Yeah why not, it's close for you;;
I've never thought about it only being 2400km away;;
I agree, 2400 is not small, but what is it, 3 hours flight? Not so much either;;
It's basically the same Distance I ha e to Rome as far as I remember,  so it's not bad.;;
I guess most work would be about getting the right Visas and such;;
Morning everyone;;
Morning! <@311684705810513921>  how‚Äôre you?;;
Morning mangos!;;
What up <@311684705810513921> ?;;
Hey <@524820041976250368>;;
Hey <@87241615671832576>;;
And <@207416847019016202>;;
Hey! <@488734758847905803> how‚Äôre you?;;
Hello <@488734758847905803>;;
Ahhh my magic failed <@207416847019016202>;;
I'm doing well;;
Was trying to catch up on the conversation;;
That‚Äôs good!;;
Fuck cheaters dude;;
Yes I agree;;
Luckily, I've only been cheated on twice that I know of;;
Still sucked though;;
Never cheated myself;;
Yeah it does, but I‚Äôm losing someone I got close to because of my cousin and it sucks;;
It‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like getting close to people;;
Well, being from a family of nomads, and a believer of reincarnation;;
It makes for good spiritual exercise to be forced to miss someone;;
The person is still there in the world, and with technology you don't have to lose touch;;
I'm not saying it's not sad;;
But it helps in a way to go through that and grow.;;
My family is all over the place and always has been. It can get lonely, but it also helps you to grow. ;;
Same thing for your situation I believe;;
Right I understand that she said she‚Äôd come back and visit and we will still stay in contact, I just wish my cousin would get his head out of his ass and stop being a jerk for no reason;;
Yeah, some people have to be hurt emotionally usually to change their toxic patterns;;
This isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs done it, I just didn‚Äôt get along with my cousins exes;;
Feelzbad :(;;
It‚Äôs okay he still hasn‚Äôt showed back up so he doesn‚Äôt even know she‚Äôs leaving tomorrow but I‚Äôm sure he will regret it;;
<@524820041976250368> doing well! just got off work! how are you?;;
<@488734758847905803> yo yo, how's your day so far?;;
I‚Äôm good! Just chilling watching streams! Bet your glad to be off work! <@311684705810513921>;;
Indeed, have a full day of just stuff to do;;
Ah well I hope you have a fantastic day!;;
I knew that  <@524820041976250368> would enjoy ban people! Instead she decided to start breaking them up!;;
But it's good thing of course in this case  <@524820041976250368>;;
Lmao omg <@207416847019016202> I don‚Äôt ban people! üòÇ;;
We all would love to be able to ban the nasty people;;
Sorry, you can't ban me;;
I wouldn‚Äôt ever ban you! You‚Äôre too great!;;
And that‚Äôs true <@87241615671832576>;;
What I find very strange here - most of local shops don't have price tags on goods. Big ones, like Carrefour, of course has, but almost all local shops, that are basically usual supermarket, doesn't have most of the prices.;;
Some prices are shown to you when you enter shop, but I find such practice very shady, and we don't buy in such places;;
By the way  <@524820041976250368> thanks for all kind words you said about  me while I was away. I allsaw it all;;
in general everything are pretty shady in their economy;;
So in Russia's;;
TRUE;;
But that doesn't affect price tags in russia;;
That's at least something;;
But i do not believe in any of the economics system we currently use anyway;;
I'm more concerned about my consumer experience, so I compare moscow and Dubai, and it doesn't matter in this case, how much politics steal it on moscow;;
Aww no problem! <@207416847019016202>;;
Hey everyone! No prices on items is very shady <@207416847019016202> hope you are having fun so far!;;
How‚Äôre you? <@416803598173995018>;;
Good job <@!524820041976250368>, your dongle just grew to 18!;;
Nice dongle! lol I‚Äôm good <@524820041976250368> just waking up. How are you?;;

And thank you!;;
Very nice! I‚Äôve got a busy day ahead but can hopefully stream later or watch some at least;;

<@416803598173995018> I'm a pc boi. <@409836692158021632> Because I streamed something that didn't turn out good for my style, then got bored real fast;;
stupid PC master race <@498246547838992414>;;
Oi;;
Good pc master race;;
Hopefully I can get one this year. I'd say we could play apex later but Ive only got a ps4;;
Perhaps the apex gods will grace us with crossplay?;;
ahh right, forgot about that. Keyboard and mouse players would destroy controller players though lol;;
has there been any talk of crossplay?;;
I'll look it up;;
Yeah it says coming in the future, no date. Also new modes coming soon as well;;
Yeah, new modes would be sick;;
I get bored of regular battle royale real quick;;
Just a quick search said singles and duos, not sure about anything else. I get sick of them too but so far I havent with apex, Im really liking it;;
I like it as well, but I need to have somebody to play with;;
I find it a bit boring with randoms;;
Yeah and very frustrating as well;;
oh sorry to hear that <@498246547838992414>;;
It‚Äôs so weird without mango, orange and Kelly being super active here lol;;
TRUE;;
the Mango Tree is empty without the holy trinity;;
Well depending on how much longer <@348165887347523594> is on vacation, I may be knocking him out of the trinity. My dongle is so close to his now;;

when I was a manager I worked 108 hours in a week, barely got any sleep;;
Sounds terminator-y to me;;
Holy crap;;
extended holiday hours, short handed and no overtime pay... it sucked;;
Yeah that does not sound fun at all;;
Why I got out of management, despite the good pay otherwise;;

Aww! <@207416847019016202> thank you and good morning!;;
Hey  <@524820041976250368>;;
How‚Äôre you? <@207416847019016202>;;
Good;;
Another day of discovering city and finding food;;
We found beach yesterday;;
Oh wow that‚Äôs awesome;;
"I say found because not like other tourists, we didnt just take taxi, we rode metro and then a lot of walking through ""authentic local districts""";;
Oh that‚Äôs cool!;;
I want to say that drivers here is very nice;;
Not like in russia;;
And VERY NOT LIKE in turkey;;
Here's a lot of harsh laws about road rules, and large fines, so everybody is a nice drivers;;
It compensate for lack of pedestrian road crosses in civil districts, and their TOTAL absence in simple districts;;
I‚Äôm glad they are nice! I can honestly say bad vibes from people can make a person not wanna come back. And that‚Äôs understandable;;
In turkey, for example, there s a lot of pedestrian road crosses, but drivers don't care about them at all. They don't stop;;
Oh wow that‚Äôs insane;;
morning;;
Goodnight everyone;;
Sleep tight üòÉ;;
morning <@87241615671832576>;;
I see you enjoy Dubai <@207416847019016202>;;
"and what is ""authentic local districts""?";;
The city is only around 30 or 40 years old üòõ;;
So I am intriequed in the meaning;;
you know, just cheap looking district with a lot of small buildings and a lot of locals (a least they are more locals than tourists);;
we live in a district with a lot of big hotels, and in downtown there a lot of skyscrapers;;
and districts im talking about - they look more simple and cheap;;
and by authentic i actually meant that they look like somenthing like other similar mulim countries, because for me it was very turkish like;;
Ahh okay like that;;
For some reason we didn't make any photos in that districts, but this is closest to that;;
theres almost NO pedestrian road crosses;;
you need to run across the street wherever you feel more safe;;
üëç;;
and i want to say, having oven, microwave oven, washing machine in hotel room is hillarious;;
Have you never had that in a hotel room? <@207416847019016202>;;
no, never, before this one;;
Me neither;;
Oh wow! I‚Äôve been in one, before a long time ago;;
Here;;
and it looks a bit like a desert;;
wow, that's a fully functional kitchen;;
yep it is <@87241615671832576>;;
i dont have such kitchen at home haha;;
seems abit more like a small appartment and not a hotel;;
That‚Äôs beautiful;;
exactly <@87241615671832576>;;
we have such things in more appartment hotels. like hostels and such, but there kitchen for several rooms;;
and here its just one hotel room with a kitchen;;
how expensive is it to live there?;;
imo not much, we paid 1000 bucks for 11 days at hotel and for both flights, for 2 people;;
or maybe it was 1100;;
we chosed not to have hotel breakfast option though, it was another 50-100 bucks (i cant remember haha);;
breakfast/lunch/dinner i mean;;
Ahh okay, well 1000 buck are more or less 100 a day, which is 3000 buck a month, it's certainly more than I could afford, but if you have a fortune I guess it's not that expensive;;
<@207416847019016202> you rich fuck;;
Also, Good morning;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
really guys? you consider vacation for 1000 bucks is much?;;
everybody in poor russia does it;;
I spent 1500 for a week in Tokyo;;
That was expensive üòÇ;;
russia tourists loves a lot to go to warm sea places;;
egypt, thailand, turkey;;
and such;;
and if its two people, i dont think its possible to find good 2 people vacation less than 1000;;
well if only out of season;;
we went to turkey one time in november, and it was only 500;;
but here, now i think its very cheap, because its almost winter;;
its almost 30 at day, considering that in summer its 40-50;;
That‚Äôs not bad;;
also, its kinda myth, that everything is expensive here;;
its not a lot more expensive than in moscow;;
maybe 1.5 times maximum;;
Oh wow, I wanna go there!;;
is there a place you dont wanna go? <@524820041976250368>;;
Nope I wanna visit everywhere! Haha;;

Mrs. Changeover is playing apex and is officially wayyyy worse than <@537319907541516311>;;
lmao;;
I'm showing a friend of mine what apex is like;;
To be fair, she does not play games and rarely ever did in life lol but it‚Äôs so painful to watch;;
<@416803598173995018>  i bet she still better than me and <@488734758847905803>;;
Lmao <@488734758847905803> was good today! We played a bit and he had a few kills and we almost one a game;;
She might be better than you at apex though <@207416847019016202> lol;;
<@488734758847905803>  was good? Possibly it was <@467974634977886220>  playing;;
Very possible;;
<@488734758847905803> you wanna play a round or two?;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Sorry to tell you <@207416847019016202> but <@488734758847905803> is good at apex now.. He superhero punched a guy in his stream earlier..;;
He‚Äôs acceptable now lol;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:PM:539114910211112995> <:PM:539114910211112995>;;
Good evening/night everyone . Finally back to the hotel in florida after a long day. Can't wait to be Wednesday.;;
Hey <@348165887347523594> I bet you‚Äôre exhausted;;
Indeed  <@416803598173995018>.;;
But with a good mood;;
Well you can rest now maybe?;;
Hey <@348165887347523594> !!;;
Thats good man, really glad to hear it;;
I'm going to enjoy a bit of internet and TV first  <@416803598173995018>. I missed it while in Jamaica lol.;;
Hello  <@526319824704634881>, how have you been?;;
Lol yeah I would too if I didn‚Äôt have it at all;;
I can go without tv but internet probably not lol;;
Agree..can't live without internet..;;
Kinda sad I suppose but yeah me either lol;;
Yeah üòÖ . The house I was staying in was big and the only internet was my brother's mobile phone. And let me tell you, 4g is extremely over priced there;;
"I meant to say ""but the only internet """;;
5 us dollars for 2.5 GB of data;;
Hey <@348165887347523594> ! That's so cheap compared to Brazil lol;;
Hi  <@467974634977886220>. Really???;;
That's is just about one movie;;
Damn that is expensive;;
hahah I know! it's crazy over priced here;;
Woow! That's highly expensive;;
Hi <@467974634977886220> !!!;;
I think I'm currently paying 40 dollars US for 7 GB of data a month;;
God damn!!!<:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Hey <@526319824704634881> , how are you doing?;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
And I thought our internet here is expensive.. lmao;;
haha where are you from <@526319824704634881> ?;;
I'm paying 39 euros for 30gb a month. And if I want more, it's 5 euros per 10GB;;
"I'm good..""working"" and watching streams..";;
Oh man. I pay $60usd for unlimited lol. I will not complain anymore;;
Philippines;;
That's awesome <@348165887347523594> .  I envy you haha;;
At least i think that the 40usd I pay include unlimited data for whatsapp and facebook.;;
Lol, but on the good side you have good speed at your home internet.  In Martinique fiber optic is still a rare thing.;;
"<@526319824704634881>  I'm "" working "" too haha!";;
Yeah I can‚Äôt get fiber optic where I am;;
<@416803598173995018> you can't?;;
112upload and 14 download for me so I‚Äôm happy with that;;
<@348165887347523594> nope. My area only has 2 internet companies available and neither have fiber optic;;
That's home internet speed <@416803598173995018> ?;;
Really? Wouldn't imagine that. We can get optic because we live in the city. The rest of the state barely has good regular internet;;
Yeah home internet;;
This is cable internet right?;;
Internet companies are so shady here;;
Yeah cable;;
Fiber optic is in the city over from us but not ours;;
It's not bad though . Much better than adsl;;
Yeah I can‚Äôt complain. I rarely have issues and it‚Äôs pretty fast still;;
112 upload is amazing <@416803598173995018>;;
Good job <@!467974634977886220>, your dongle just grew to 5!;;
Nice dongle!;;
Lol;;
Agreed  <@467974634977886220>;;
<:Emote_DONGLE_MASTER_112_00000:543050254157873173>;;
Gg  <@467974634977886220>;;
lol <:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840>;;
I'm stuck at 5Mb/s download and 800Kb upload with my adsl line;;
Which is not even good enough to watch a twitch stream;;
<@348165887347523594> oh I see what you mean, that's not so good;;
Not at all. It never really bothered me until I started watching twitch streams though. It is enough to watch anything else at 1080p with no lag. Multiplayer works fine too. But twitch seems to require around 6 to 7 Mbps download;;
what up <@467974634977886220> !!;;
hey <@348165887347523594>;;
That's interesting, maybe it's a different quality. Because here at my parents I have around 5Mb download, but it's not good at all;;
Evandro is here playing Forza lol;;
lol your parents' internet is complete shiiiiit;;
I couldn't stand it;;
Hey <@488734758847905803> ‚ù§;;
‚ù§;;
Cool, have fun!;;
It;s so weird calling you <@467974634977886220>;
<@488734758847905803> sup bro;;
I'm getting used to it haha;;
Lool;;
I don't even know your real name anymore lol;;
soon youll forget my name lol;;
omg!;;
wow;;

Lmao;;
Lmao;;
Mango fight!;;
I'll throw my seeds at ya;;

that means 2 things;;
üòÖ;;
I know you‚Äôre name <@488734758847905803> and that‚Äôs all that matters;;
‚ù§;;
see <@467974634977886220> ?;;
<@416803598173995018> won't forget my name;;
Did you ever know that you‚Äôre my hero? Because you are the wind beneath my wings;;
hahaha ok I'll ask <@416803598173995018> whenever I forget it then;;
Yeah you've got competition now! lmao;;
Actually I think some people here know my real name too lol cause of the Arnold video I posted;;
was it supposed to be a secret?;;
Hhmm...I need to check that video;;
Lol I deleted it!;;
Muahahahahahaha;;
Nah I don‚Äôt care <@467974634977886220> lol;;
Nooooooo <@416803598173995018>;;
hahaha I think I said <@488734758847905803> 's name in our stream many times.;;
yeah in the Silent Hill 2 stream;;
Not fear, everyone knows my name is Dongle, Kelly Dongle;;
hahaha;;
guys, check out <#512649569595555860>;;
<@467974634977886220> you too ‚ù§;;
<@488734758847905803> can I talk to you in dm;;
sure <@448648678224429068>;;
morning <@524820041976250368>;;
How's everyone doing?  üòä;;
hey <@486507510635823104>;;
apparently everybody is sleeping;;
longest meetongs ever;;
<@207416847019016202>  how you doing? üòÅ;;
good, very good, hbu <@486507510635823104>;;
Just finished a full plate of sushi üç£;;
finished eating? finished cooking? <@455797717763883009>;;
Eating of course;;
Also, how would you guys rate Battlefront 2? (The campaign);;
Star Wars Battlefront? <@455797717763883009>;;
This is the first time I‚Äôve woken up and haven‚Äôt had to scroll through a lot of dialogue to catch up lol;;
Yup;;
Both the games 1 & 2;;
just the story. Worth playing?;;
The new ones or old ones?;;
I'm planning on extending my EA Access subscription;;
New ones;;
20 152 017;;
I honestly don‚Äôt remember a campaign in the first one lol;;
Second one was fun though. I bought it for like $7USD and I feel it was worth it;;
Was looking forward to the one by Viceral games. But then EA happened;;
First one doesn't have a campaign if I recall correctly;;
Yeah same here about scrolling <@416803598173995018>;;
EA is like the Boogeyman for videogame franchises;;
Lol yeah <@455797717763883009> it could have been better. It wasn‚Äôt bad, just lacked a lot. <@488734758847905803> that‚Äôs what I thought;;
I played like 25 minutes of anthem last night with the EA access trial;;
And obviously micro transactions destroyed the second one;;
How was it?;;
Honestly, flying is cool, I thought shooting was cool;;
How'd you like it?;;
ah;;
But it's really easy to kill the enemies (I was only at the beginning of course);;
And I already got annoyed at the fetching items;;
Did you bump into rocks?;;
A little haha;;
But that bit with the waterfall;;
Where you have to find 6 glowing rocks;;
It's like...;;
I just found 5 glowing rocks;;
Yeah that place. lol;;
Now I need to find 6?;;
there's one underwater;;
Lol yeah it looked cool but like you said, seemed repetitive so I‚Äôd get bored easily;;
Yeah;;
It's a real shame;;
Right <@455797717763883009> haha;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uozRde19RU;;
Looks cool. Might not be my kind of game though tbh;;
Yeah, just close your eyes and shoot everywhere kinda game;;
Yeah exactly;;
But I'll play if it's free haha;;
Reminded me of sunset overdrive;;
;;
What's that?;;
Pokemon makes my dongle tingle;;
But I know not to get too excited;;
For the Switch;;
that can't be hte open world rpg they promised already, can it?;;
Not sure, but i'm excited to see what they have in store;;
same;;
 franchise's eighth generation of Pok√©mon games ;;
fok yeah;;
omg, is it just me, or do you guys also hate the fact that the xbox one can't go into rest mode like the PS4 and continue to download games;;
PS4 master race;;
There is a power saver mode;;
which kicks in after certain period of idleness;;
but then it turns off after a while,  no?;;
I just switch off my tv and keep it on to download;;
you can change that in settings;;
*facepalm*;;
default is to switch off to save power consumption;;
Mine doesn't switch off ever lol;;
Unless i do it;;
lol Mango;;
I dont own an xbox so I didnt know haha;;
donglepalm;;
oops üí¶;;
hahaha;;
lmfaooooo <@455797717763883009>;;
Good afternoon Logangsters!!!;;
Sup seeds;;
what up <@498246547838992414> and <@348165887347523594> !!;;
It's warm, end me  <@488734758847905803>;;
Got up not long ago. I was thinking about staying the whole day in the hotel room chilling. But my wallet is starting to hurt bad;;
It's warm and I'm wearing my standard all-black clothing, including a black hoodie, so I'm sweating buckets;;
üòÖ  <@498246547838992414>;;
<@348165887347523594> lol yep thats what vacations will do haha;;
And we had to watch this horrible French movie in class;;
It suuuuuuucked;;
Doesnt sound fun lol;;
It wasn't  <@416803598173995018>;;
<@416803598173995018> true, I m gonna need to stay home not doing shit for the next month or so;;
lol sounds about right;;
Rip  <@348165887347523594>;;
French movies are usually shit.;;
I only go on holiday in the summer;;
Yeah  <@348165887347523594> they are, but this one, hooo boy;;
It wasn't really holiday though  <@498246547838992414>. But we tried to have a good time;;
Only French movies I watch are Luc Besson's, or some comedies;;
<@455797717763883009> or <@348165887347523594>  storm or interceptor javelin?;;
Just warm or actually hot <@498246547838992414> ?;;
Storm for me  <@488734758847905803>;;
Ranger for me;;
Ho shit. Yeah ranger, my bad;;
I hate the storm;;
Lol kelly;;
<@488734758847905803> bit warmer than normal in the winter;;
I see <@498246547838992414>;;
Like 20¬∞C or so;;
I got the storm, seems more like my style;;
Lol...the storm pissed the hell out of me at first.;;
It's subjective, but I hate the hoovering. And the very low armor. But especially hoovering.;;
I usually get low armor characters in game;;
Games*;;
The storm is good for support though and crowd control from afar.;;
I can understand that  <@488734758847905803>;;
Are you enjoying the game so far  <@488734758847905803>?;;
kinda <@348165887347523594>;;
I liked flying for sure;;
but I hated the 2 fetch quests in a row at the waterfall bit;;
Flying was the best part;;
Agree with you man. This discord is dying. Let's create out own. Just you and me. <@416803598173995018>;;
and there's this mechanical whirring;;
that makes me think there's something broken;;
very annoying;;
It's only more fetch quests;;
then i def won't feel bad about not getting this;;
Yeah I hear you;;
Huge disappointment.;;
though I did think shooting was cool too;;
a shame the story sucks according to people, because the build up here was pretty good;;
the lore and world;;
It baffles me how a company like bioware didn't learn from these passed years;;
Yeah, and coming from bioware it's even more disappointing  <@488734758847905803>;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQAm17SyRI;;
but bioware changed all their employees apparently;;
TRUE;;
Anyone still playing RD:O?;;
red dead is dead to me;;
lol yeah, i uninstalled it to get some space for anthem lol;;
<@207416847019016202> lets do it;;
i wasnt even planning on playing the online mode anyway;;
I still haven't finished the solo mission. But the online mode did not hold my attention more than a day  <@455797717763883009>;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>  <@416803598173995018>;;
we can call it the mangoless tree;;
Yeah even i played online for just a day;;
<@488734758847905803> same man, I go for low armor and speed most of the time;;
Yeah,  <@455797717763883009>, but I already knew it wouldn't since I have never been a GTA online fan. I thought it was going to be similar. So no disappointment;;
Yeah, but RDR2 was well worth the 60 bucks;;
yeah;;
that story tho;;
i didnt like gta online either;;
I have to give red dead another try. I‚Äôll go back once I get sick of apex probably;;
the story is really good;;
nothing crazy;;
but it i s really good;;
<@455797717763883009> Totally worth.;;
I did not like shooting at all, thought that system was bad. I bought too many games at once when that came out and I just forgot about it lol;;
oh shooting was tough at first;;
yuo get used to it though;;
Yeah, took a while until i got used to the dead eye;;
The controls felt clunky the entire time though. But as  <@488734758847905803> says we get use to it;;
It annoyed me that everything was slow, very slow;;
Yeah I did get used to them. I played maybe a 1/4 of the game;;
Yeah I do like faster paced shooting in games. That‚Äôs why I like apex and rainbow six;;
I think that I'm at about 50% ...I really need to get back to it;;
Yeah same. I‚Äôll play apex until I‚Äôm bored with it and then once the new operators come out on R6, I‚Äôll go back to that and probably mix red dead in between. Still have to finish last of us also;;
I'm gonna get the last of us too. It looks amazing;;
What stopped me woth RDR2 was Spiderman. It came out while I was playng rdr2 and never got back to it. Not that rdr2 bored me but at that time I needed fun with no shore.;;
Didnt Spiderman come out way before RDR2?;;
Yeah;;
Spiderman came out before;;
Sep - Spiderman, Tomb Raider;;
Oct - AC odyssey, RDR2;;
I stopped Odyssey for RDR2;;
Hhmmm....So here it arrived to the stores after. I didn't notice it before. My bad;;
I got it while playing rdr2, but same story. I needed immediate fun;;
is anyone gonna get the division 2 for xbox?;;
I may be  <@488734758847905803>. Not sure. Sucks that I have the original xbox one. I tend to get the new games in my ps4 pro or PC.;;
Will there be any discount with gsmepass?;;
no;;
You'll get a discount on Ubistore;;
if you've played Ubisoft games and have 100 coins;;
20% i think;;
Ubistore is PC right,?;;
even console;;
you get a physical copy;;
Ok that is cool;;
I got Odyssey Gold Edition for 20% off;;
Nice;;
If my finances weren't so tight at the moment I would definitely get an xbox one X;;
I'm having a hard time getting my clients to pay me. Drives me crazy. I'm trying to keep calm but fuck it is slowly getting to me.;;
Just send <@207416847019016202> to collect the debts;;
True  <@416803598173995018>üòÖ üòÖ;;
I think i'm gonna stream later even though it's tuesday;;
since I beat RE2 last night, i'm thinking of doing either Metro 2033, Wolfenstein The New Order, or KH1;;
Metro or wolfenstein;;
rooty-tooty-point-n-shooty;;

Good morning everyone!;;

<@488734758847905803> not bad; resting before I head to school. I might just stream the drive there! Thanks for asking, how are you?;
haha nice!;;
I'm good as well;;
just gonna play some apex before i go to the grocery store and do some stuff;;
I was playing some breath of the wild earlier. Never got to beat it, and got lost, so I'm starting over after almost 1.5 years. I've been a Zelda person since the first NES one, and I feel bad never finishing the Switch one.;;
Good job <@!515361538081554443>, your dongle just grew to 2!;;
Both are great games <@488734758847905803> can‚Äôt go wrong with either;;
yeah <@515361538081554443> , i am a huge zelda fan as well (even have a triforce tattooed on my hand lol);;
But breath of the wild didnt sink it's hooks in me like hte other games;;
did you finish both <@416803598173995018> ?;;
Yeah I finished both a few years ago;;
<@488734758847905803>  you getting Division 2 on xbox?;;
I might if you guys do;;
<@515361538081554443> - what's your twitch?;;
<@455797717763883009> , thats the kind of game i prob wouldnt play alone wihtout friends;;
makes sense;;
But its said to have 40hours of campaign play;;
Btw, Far Cry 5 is like 12‚Ç¨ on the Brazilian MS Store. wtf <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
is that cheap?;;
Yes;;
i think it's like 50brl;;
yeah haha;;
the conversion is insane;;
Here it's 28‚Ç¨;;
yeah it said 49.25 brl or so;;
Even more cheaper in Argentina;;
damn;;
yeah;;
Morning  <@515361538081554443>;;
I saw you joining this discord but didn't have a chance to greet you. So, welcome here;;
And don't trust anyone , every man for himself;;
Definitely dont trust <@409836692158021632>;;
<@455797717763883009> far cry 5 is $14.99 USD here, thats pretty cheap;;
<@207416847019016202> <@515361538081554443> only trust your fellow Latinos. Quedamos unidos...üòâ;;
ah si;;
puede confiar en mia persona;;
not sure if thats right in spanish lo;;
lol;;
Is being Portuguese considered latino? lol;;
if its brazilina yes;;
Nope, straight from the homeland lol. The Iberian peninsula is where my grandfathers family is from;;
so spain and portugal;;
<@416803598173995018> yeah that's like a meal right?;;
Whats like a meal?;;
15$ lol;;
ohhh ok lol. Yeah pretty much haha;;
So I can skip a meal and buy FC5;;
seems like a smart decision to me;;
FC5 was pretty fun;;
Yeah need to check it out;;
I think you can build locations too but I never did that. I just killed people lol;;
I'm just there for the story;;
Btw, Division 2 Open Beta from 1st - 4th March;;
Story isnt too bad in it;;
I gotta try division 2;;
Wait <@416803598173995018> didn't you say you were Russian decent or something.;;
<@416803598173995018>  is the result of a EuroTrip;;
<@345380744375566338> my family were a bunch of traveling whores so I'm pretty much everything in Europe;;
Ok so you are American then...üòÇ;;
nice;;
we could give the beta a shot;;
lol yeah 2nd generation. Grandmother came here in 1953 from Germany;;
see if it's worth a buy;;
Yeah, let's try on the 1st, if it lets you team up;;
Pre load would be 24 hours prior;;
Yea It's funny. I am first generation from Puerto Rico. However, if you go back further than my great, great grandparents having never left the island, then Puerto Ricans are actually Ta√≠no tribe, mixed with Spanierds and West Africans.;;
Yeah it's really interesting to see where my family came from that I had no clue of and neither did my parents;;
I think a little prospective and being able to experience the culture, language, history, and food are great because it brings appreciation and some understanding of other cultures.;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwWdAYYDuqU;;

Grab'em by the dongle baby;;

Fokin compass or damn compass for it to be family friendly?;;
üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;
Fokin;;
yeah they've said that a couple times during Apex already ;;
for me, I'd grab the family friendly version üòÇ ;;
but it's Mango merch so it's all up to you, oh Purple One;;
"It's not family friendly, but Battlestar Gallactica got away with ""fraking""";;
hahaha;;
yeah, i think family friendly is better;;
"maybe I'll even cut out ""damned""";;
Do I look like a compass to you?;;
and that's it;;
Maybe faken?;;
"im not english speaker, so i would go with ""fucking""";;
Good job <@!207416847019016202>, your dongle just grew to 31!;;
lmao <@207416847019016202> ;;
maybe i'll set up two versions then;;
thats a hillarious way to grow;;
Yeah two versions is better  <@488734758847905803>;;
GG  <@207416847019016202>;;

Soon enough. I need to get more games on console though;;
What are you thinking about getting? <@348165887347523594>;;
Dongle user  simulator;;
I heard it‚Äôs really hard;;
Pun intended;;
LMAO hahah;;
<@416803598173995018> is metro scary at all?;;
Are there jump scares and stuff?;;
Or anyone else can answer as well if they've played;;
Umm it‚Äôs a little freaky and a few jump scares if I remember correctly yeah;;
Not like RE2;;
Yeah re2 is ridiculous;;
Lol yeah I think by yourself with the headset on for sure. I‚Äôve only played it at my friends with no headset;;
Hahaha it's insane;;
uuuuuugh;;
The zombie cries from somewhere in the room;;
And mango freaks out;;
Lmao that clip you posted where the guy is right by the door is so fucking funny. I must have watched it 10 times and laughed super hard each time;;
Hahahaha;;
It's great for sure haha;;
I have to post some of my old jump scare ones;;
Before the discord had people hshah;;
Lol yeah those would be good. Your screams are hilarious;;
Lol glad my fear entertains you sickos;;
Lol hey whatever works!  Sell your fear for money haha;;
Hahaha yeah;;
Too bad there aren't many scary games I havent played;;
Yeah true. The only game that legit freaked me out was FEAR. You ever play that? Well silent hill too actually;;
I played fear 3;;
Was pretty scary;;
Silent Hill is fucked up;;
I only played sh2;;
But still;;
Man I just checked out The Sinking City cinematic trailer. My jaw literally dropped;;
I think it was the first or second fear that freaked me out. Yeah silent hill 2 was so creepy;;
Haven‚Äôt heard of it <@455797717763883009> what is it?;;
Yeah that game looks so cool <@455797717763883009>;;
It's based on call of Cthulhu <@416803598173995018>;;
I think it's a PS4 exclusive;;
No it's on Xbox PS4 and Steam;;
Oh cool then;;
Was supposed to release March 21st, but it's been pushed to May 23rd (Amazon);;
Yeah I saw it was delayed;;
Feelzbad;;
But I prefer it to be delayed than get delivered before it's ready;;
Cause I don't go back to games;;
Just ask ffxv;;
we added new cutscenes and this and that ;;
Yeah?;;
Well, go fok yourself. I finished the game a year ago;;
For sure. I'm in no hurry to play a game which the dev thinks is unfinished;;
Lol;;
Yeah ext;;
Exactly*;;
Was hoping for auto correct to finish that for me;;
Even the NG+ mode doesn't do much for me;;
Nope;;
I only feel like playing Ng+ for horizon zero Dawn;;
Because I looooved that game;;
I have that disc staring right at me now. Need to play it lol;;
Oh man it's soooo good;;
One of the best, if not THE best , story in a game;;
Damn. Will check it out. Soon.;;
Hopefully before E3;;
Wanna catch up on my backlog so I can be pumped for new releases;;
<@488734758847905803> never heard of call of chutulu either lol;;
I need to broaden my horizons apparently;;
HP Lovecraft. Heard of the author? <@416803598173995018>;;
Im horrible with names but it does sound familiar;;
https://youtu.be/zEy2rUEC1gM;;
Imo of course;;

kinda reminds me of bioshock;;
Hope everyone is having a great day!;;
Hey <@524820041976250368> same to you! How are you today?;;
I‚Äôm doing better! Not as stressed today, how‚Äôre you? <@416803598173995018>;;

Are you feeling better by the way? I remember you weren't feeling great last week;;
Yes I had a severe migraine yesterday but feeling better today. Not having the severe pains I was having last week;;
Migraines are the worst. I get them once in awhile and need to be in complete darkness. Happy to hear the pains are gone!;;
Yeah I‚Äôve dealt with them since I was 12üòÇ and thank you! Me too!;;
That's definitely not fun. I share your pain lol. Luckily I only get them once in awhile;;
Cheer up! Spring is comming. The light returns.;;
Good job <@!351323158826975232>, your dongle just grew to 2!;;
<@351323158826975232> yessss, cant wait! I need the days to last longer so I can get back to playing golf after work;;

Good good, just making dinner. ;;
Hey  <@416803598173995018> ! What's up;;
hey <@535295021482508299> !;;
<@488734758847905803> hey man! Metro looks good, I never actually played that series. Always wanted to;;
really?;;
I played 20 mins of the first one;;
thats it haha;;
<@488734758847905803> did you love it immediately?;;
not immediately as I recall. it was years ago that I played it though;;
like 3-4;;
Same old  <@535295021482508299> heading out to the gym in a few and can hopefully get some streaming in today;;
<@488734758847905803> oh okay. They look really cool;;
<@416803598173995018> sweet! What you streaming if you get on?;;
yeah they do <@535295021482508299>;;
and i've heard <@160543395037708288> say it's one of his fav franchises now;;
yup amazing games;;
2033 is the first one right <@160543395037708288> ?;;
<@488734758847905803> <@160543395037708288> sold! Haha;;
yup;;
Exodus and 2033 are far better than Last Light;;
but Last Light explains a lot of the story;;
I see;;
gonna play the last match of apex, shower, then stream!;;
get your dongles ready bois;;
also the games suck on easier difficulty;;
not the same game;;
its meant to be done in survival;;
mode;;
what difficulty do i have to be play it on?;;
is that the hardest?;;
i recommend survival hardcore;;
i did survival hardcore for first;;
<:BM:539114906276986882>;;
then survival ranger hardcore for last light;;
but i recommend survival hardcore;;
then for Exodus do hardcore;;
or even ranger;;
Harder difficulty makes games so much better usually;;
<:PM:539114910211112995>;;
<@535295021482508299> most likely apex, cant put the game down lol;;

Welcome  <@432661245066477583>;;
Thanks nice to be here;;
I think so <@432661245066477583> , but the lack of actual new content also makes it hard to want to return for more than 30 min üòÉ;;
That too but anything can be solved with friends;;
Good job <@!432661245066477583>, your dongle just grew to 1!;;
yeahh that's true;;
Welcome <@432661245066477583>;;

Oh cool;;
Off today so yeah;;
That‚Äôs good;;
How are you doing?;;
I‚Äôm good just laying here downloading a game on my laptop;;
What are you going to play?;;
Apex haha shhhh;;
Cool I play on PC and xbox myself.;;
You play many fps?;;
First time playing lol, never played it before. And I don‚Äôt know what fps is I‚Äôm not a gamer I usually just support üòÇ;;
First  person shooters  sorry didn't  mean to abbreviate it;;
It‚Äôs all good, and no I don‚Äôt lol;;
You should play more there are so many games out there you should be able to find something you like;;
I love watching apex and bo4 and horror games but haven‚Äôt played any. Once I get a PS4 I‚Äôll start playing more;;
Good for you;;
For sure, what games you like to play?;;
Everything  no lie I will try anything;;
Right now I have been wanting to just play apex;;
I‚Äôm the same way lol;;
Morning fellas üêº;;
Yo panda;;
Morning! <@455797717763883009>;;
Yo Baker;;
Morning nerdy;;
how are you guys doing?;;
Been a while;;
Yup you went on a work trip last time I talked to you;;
I‚Äôm good, how‚Äôre you?;;
Doing good. At work as usual;;
What games have you  guys been playing?;;
None right now I‚Äôm downloading apex tho;;
Apex and I did play and beat CD3 not sure why people had so much beef with the game oh it was on gamepass so I didn't buy it;;
morning everyone;;
Morning! <@300033838065778702>;;
hello <@524820041976250368> hope youre doing well üòÑ;;
I‚Äôm good! How‚Äôre you? <@300033838065778702>;;
i am not too shabby myself. been busy packing my stuff <@524820041976250368>;;
Moving? <@300033838065778702>;;
yeah i am moving back home permanently in April. currently living in London but moving back to Brunei <@524820041976250368>;;
Oh okay I‚Äôve never been to either of those place;;
it's alrite. no one has ever been to Brunei üòÑ;;
I‚Äôve never even heard of it lol;;
most people actually needed to google it whenever i mention where i am from lol;;
Yup never heard of it;;
Hey  <@524820041976250368> there is a London and a Brunei in Texas.....Haha;;
there's a Brunei in Texas? üòÆ <@343707181377388544>;;
Haha really? <@343707181377388544>;;
<@343707181377388544>  I did play CD 3 for sometime;;
But its too repetitive;;
Yeah texas is so big they had to use all the names of other cities;;
Yeah it is pretty big lol;;
<@455797717763883009> I will give you it was a bit repetitive but I beat it in two sittings so it really didn't bother me;;
Yeah, i think it's fine as long as you're playing it through Gamepass;;
Yeah I think if you paid more then the monthly fee of gamepass you might be justified in being mad;;
TRUE;;
But I think that's how gamepass has changed the game when it comes to games that come to the service and their value;;
I suppose, but FH4 delivered what a AAA should. CD3 was a Microsoft Studios game;;
I never thought CD3 was going to be AAA not even close;;
I thought it would hit around Recore level of quality;;
I thought sunset overdrive  was a a good game that people just didn't play;;
yeah i need to play it;;
I think i expected more out of CD3, especially with all the hype around Terry Crews being in the game;;
They did over promise on the TC in the game they should have saturated the game with him missed opportunity for sure;;
Yeah that was disappointing;;
The only exclusive I'm looking forward to this year is Ori and the Will of the Wisps;;
Still need to play the first one;;
Play it before WotW releases. It's on gamepass too;;
The first one i mean;;
Plan to...... but apex man;;
Am I the only one not playing Apex? lol;;
Maybe man it is free;;
Haha, I have a lot of games unplayed, purchased and on gamepass;;
Don't we all;;
so <@524820041976250368> , how is apex?;;
suggestion for you fellow streamers;;
https://gamingcareers.net/guides/30-free-webcam-filters-obs/;;
add a LUT filter to your cam to make it pop and draw in more people;;
a TON of options and that link has a free pack of 30 filters;;
Morning all;;
Sup dude;;
Hey <@278571432588345345> whats going on?;;
Work and I'm sleepy af today;;
Time for a massive coffee;;
<a:hotcoffee:537944974160035861>;;
Good morning guys!;;
Holy that's a cool emoji <@278571432588345345>;;
Though it makes me feel like it's spicy haha;;
<a:hypnotoad:423739249930665995>;;
Look at the toad everybody;;
The truth toad;;
I know everything about the universe now;;
lol I hear you <@278571432588345345> just about to make myself a coffee now;;
hypnotoad;;
‚òï;;
It's fooking 22¬∞C;;
22 isn't bad;;
It keeps getting worse;;
Hahahaha;;
What temperature do you need it to be to be comfortable?;;
Yesterday it was 19, the day before like 5;;
<@488734758847905803> I'd want something like 15¬∞C to be comfortable lol;;
That's kinda cold haha;;
Well, I'm a cold individual;;
its 22 in street or in appartment? <@!498246547838992414>;;
Outside  <@207416847019016202>;;
how is it possible???;;
its february;;
is it normal in belgium?;;
Yeah, last year on this day, there was snow;;
Good job <@!498246547838992414>, your dongle just grew to 18!;;
yeet;;
Normally it's pretty cold until late march;;
Yeah it's 21¬∞ here;;
its 22 here right now in dubai, strange haha;;
But you're in Italy, right?  <@455797717763883009> so it's normal;;
Enjoying abandoning us  <@207416847019016202>?;;
It‚Äôs 11 here lol;;
22 is my perfect temperate I think;;
Temperature*;;
Maybe 23;;
Yeah it's actually nice;;
Sick of wearing layers of clothing;;
even these days i chat here more than you lol <@!498246547838992414>;;
layers? youre kidding me <@455797717763883009>;;
Layers at 21?;;
I mean I was lol;;
When It was single digit;;
Yeah I‚Äôll only put a light jacket on or a long sleeve shirt if it gets below 9 but really, you never need layers in Los Angeles. Well the people who grew up here do but I grew up in cold weather so I‚Äôm used to it;;
I'm a tropical weather guy;;
Below 9 I need thermals;;
Lol that‚Äôs fair if you live in Italy though. It‚Äôs like everyone who grew up here. They are used to warm most of the year;;
I love Boston with all my heart but to move back would be hard lol. I don‚Äôt like the snow very much anymore;;
i put layers on only if its -15/-20, and im up to big walk;;
if it is just home to train, or from train to work, or to lunch, im in jeanse and winter jacket over t shirt;;
<@455797717763883009> where in Italy are you? I will be in lake como the second week of June;;
<@207416847019016202> that‚Äôs because robots can‚Äôt feel cold;;
no, thats because -10 is not so bad;;
all you need is warm winter jacket;;
to be honest i dont know is there a better word instead of jacket;;
Lmao;;
Snow sucks when you're an adult;;
You have to shovel that shit;;
And drive in that shit;;
And shit in that shit;;
Who have to shovel it Haha?  <@488734758847905803>;;
I dont;;
<@488734758847905803> exactly, thats why I hate it lol;;
I always had to shovel driveway, path up to house back in Boston;;
had to dig the car out of it too;;
I'm very glad that we came here in Dubai in winter. Now it's ideal summer temperature for me. 20 in evenings and up to 30 in days. And actually here is very hot even when sun is hidden.;;
But in summer here is hell;;
Up to 50;;
I think that's the main reason why here is almost not possible to walk around;;
Because in summer you will not walk more then 10-20 minutes;;
So everybody use cars and taxis;;
Yeah I bet summer there is brutal;;
Yeah;;
My father in law is in Indonesia for business right now and he said its awful there with the heat;;
I would not want to be here in summer. Just taxi from place to place;;
For now we didn't use taxi for once;;
We love to explore walking + transport;;
Metro here is pretty good;;
But in most parts of the city walk is almost impossible;;
<@416803598173995018>im in Milan. Close to Como;;
Oh nice! Thats where we are flying into lol;;
Still gotta figure out how to get to como from there;;
Directly from the airport?;;
Depends on which airport you're landing in, there are 3 airports around;;
Im not sure, we will be coming from Tours, France but yes we will be going directly from the airport to Como;;
sorry I man not sure which airport we are flying into at Milan, we havent gotten flights yet;;
yeah, because it depends on the flight carrier you choose;;
whatever is the cheapest probably lol;;
haha, anyways you let me know once your tickets are booked. I can suggest the cheapest / fastest way to como;;
Awesome! Thank you so much. We had no clue, we figured either a car service or maybe there is a train so that would be very helpful of you;;
Should have tickets hopefully by this weekend;;
Yeah there are plenty of trains. Just depends on the time, so i can tell you which station would be the easiest;;
Because there are 2 major train stations too lol;;
That's great! As soon as we get tickets, I will let you know. Thank you so much!;;
How difficult is it there for people who speak very little Italian? lol;;
in Rome it was pretty hard <@416803598173995018>;;
if i didnt know portuguese;;
We had no trouble in France, we speak basic French and as long as you greeted people in French and then told them that your French sucks, they were friendly lol and most people spoke english anyways there;;
same here <@416803598173995018>;;
romans are not as friendly;;
not even close;;
English should be fine. At least in all the touristy places;;
Listening to the interview now <@488734758847905803>  <@278571432588345345> <:PM:539114910211112995>;;
<@207416847019016202> it hasn‚Äôt downloaded all the way yet. Internet sucks here so haven‚Äôt played it;;
nice <@455797717763883009> !;;
as i mentioned in the description, there were some tech issues unfortunately. But I put the pieces of the interview together;;
hopefully it's not too bad;;
<@488734758847905803> lol good to know for future visits. <@455797717763883009> ok perfect, thanks!;;
We aren‚Äôt you‚Äôre typical ignorant Americans lol. We don‚Äôt expect people to speak English and then get mad when they don‚Äôt;;
Ahahaa;;
yeah lole;;
Romans do that though;;
You not speak Italian? We better. leave now;;
we ran into sooo many Americans like that in France. We were so embarassed by them;;
people in paris were super nice to us;;
*donglepalm*;;
Parisians are so nice;;
we loved it there, would move there in a heartbeat lol;;
There's always this  group from your country where you're visiting, and they embarrass  you (enough to make you leave that spot) lol;;
It's like that British family in NZ;;
They were a sensation lol;;
lol yep. I had to apologize for one guy at a cafe to the waitress and I called him out on it too. He was beyond rude;;
Mostly we pretended to be German lol. They love German people there for some reason;;
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6617617/Unruly-British-family-NZ-caught-trying-steal-Red-Bull-petrol-station.html;;
"PurpleMango : ""Better on paper than skin""";;
lmao wow;;
those people just look awful;;
Thats what she said;;
Yeah terrible, NZ news actually covered them all throughout their trip;;
lol thats funny;;
Didnt run into any americans that bad in france lol;;
Haha;;
lmao <@455797717763883009>;;
better on paper than skin was great haha;;
Yeahh;;
;;
I don't need <@467974634977886220> anymore. I can make chickeeeen;;
I'm pretty sure you still need her lol;;

lmaaaaaao <@455797717763883009>;;
Lol;;
Hope it's not dry chicken  <@488734758847905803>;;
super moist <@278571432588345345>;;
Zero tolerance for dry chicken;;
Good man;;
Hey all üëã;;
Got a little break for lunch;;
Happy lunch!!!;;
Lol thanks üòä;;
Getting some dinner here;;

git dat foodz;;
<@278571432588345345> there is no worse food, than dry chicken;;
What did you get for lunch, ax?;;
hey <@87241615671832576> , what's for dinner?;;
there is none;;
shit gets in your teeth;;
<@488734758847905803> hey buddy üëã how are you?;;
I got some China one Chinese food yum!;;
niiiice;;
mango chicken?;;
just some pasta with meat source;;
I'm good dude, h ow re you?;;
meat source;;
sounds dongle-y;;
Level 25!;;
Good job <@!416803598173995018>, your dongle just grew to 25!;;
damn Im so good;;
that's impressive;;
mostly the level;;
That would be an impressive combo honestly lol;;
or the dongle;;
I am well mango been busy trying to code a discord bot. It doesn't seem to want to do what I code it to do lol;;
omg <@416803598173995018> you're hacking;;
which bot are you using <@136319407491121152> ?;;
i recommend using Streamlabs chatbot;;
No I'm making a bot of my own üéâ;;
ohhhhh;;
dayumn;;
thats dope;;
Yeah when it works LMAO;;
üíÄ;;
I hadnt understood that you were making one lol;;
No worries lol;;
lol no I just look at that levels and when its full, I know the next comment will level me up;;
would be cool to have a bot system , which tied into one discord chat and out into some stream teams and stuff like that;;
Yeah that would be awesome!;;
<@136319407491121152>!!! Hope you have a great lunch!;;
Like a member posts here and it goes into your chat there? Lol;;
<@524820041976250368> thank you lol;;
No problem! <@136319407491121152>;;
if it was actually counting all line between all channels (Twitch and Discord) it would be like a rabbit hole, where you got sucked deeper and deeper into the channels;;
It would be hell for the creators, but still;;
Oh wow. Yeah that would be impressive üëå maybe I can figure out how to do that one day and I'll share the bot with you üòâ <@87241615671832576>;;
Would be cool, i can't do anything but project management.;;
I ment I'll share it for you to use lol;;
true, but the potential could be there. Imagine a truly gamified reward system, which also helped on collaborations.;;
Maybe, actually figure why collaborations don't always work;;
There is actually already a discord community that uses a bot like that. It pretty smart TBH. The group has 18k people in it lol;;
That would be cool;;
How does it work? like tracking all lines written at certain people and try to give them special privileges?;;
like Patreon, just where your time investment are the payment;;
I am intrigued, which community are doing it? üòÑ;;
It works like this:;;
It's a percentile points system so there is points that get awarded for doing different activities with the promoted streamers( the higher point values, usually the top 1% of point holders). And the members can gain points buy doing one of the following: inviting members (which I like to avoid), lurking, and chatting with the member while they are live. The bot sits in all the members chats an do tracks who's all's there and what they are doing.;;
And there is a system that's intergrated into it that rewards points for hosting as well.;;
The catch is that the top 1% has over 2mil points and you can only gain points at a max rate of I think 1200 a min;;
yeahh i am not a fan of a top 1% thing;;
Royale streamers has a system like that. Im part of the community but new so I havent researched it at all;;
That's what I'm talking about üòÇ;;
In a round about way lol;;
To be honest i am more interested in a system, which also tried to track your interaction with other than streamers;;
It's not fun to be in a chat where there only activity surrounded by the streamer or creator;;
Royale Is not worth Imop you don't get alot of real connection with the people it brings of course there is always those special cases;;
yeah I think thats why I havent really done anything with it, it doesnt seem genuine;;
<@87241615671832576> can you elaborate a little more on that I'm not sure what you mean;;
<:axfocaHeart:489178587346501661>;;
that's the thing, I am more into something where people discover something neat because of their helpfulness or chattyness and ofc, if you like to lurk get a decent reward for that aswell;;
<@416803598173995018> yeah I'd avoid it unless you have a tremendous amount of free time on your hands;;
Good job <@!136319407491121152>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
I'll be back, but I have to put the kids to bed. So i'll try and give a better explanation after;;
Ok üòÅ <@87241615671832576> I want to know because I feel like this is what I may be lacking in my stream if I'm understanding correctly;;
Your chat is fun <@488734758847905803> üíØ;;
I think this is going to be some sort of giant flowchart in the different interactions;;
Lol;;
Not gonna lie interactions with chat make the stream even more fun for the streamer as well;;
Yeah I agree with that;;
But yeah in your guy‚Äôs opinion what is the ideal streamer;;
Not who mind you but what do y‚Äôall think are the perfect qualities a streamer should have?;;
It's very subjective. I tend to like streamers who like to talk about why they are doing something in a game and who are able to make me understand if this is a game I should have. I am not into all of the weird shenanigans, but more about the possibility of meeting new freinds.;;
That‚Äôs pretty fair;;
I only hope I sort of create that atmosphere in mine but only time will tell;;
Also seems da Luigi is on but I‚Äôm kinda typing while in class;;
For me that's easy: can't have a toxic attitude, the streamer has to want to make all kinds of new friends and have a sense of open mindedness when meeting new people that visit his/her stream;;
Alright I g2g back to work hope you guys and gals all have Excellent days!;;
<@136319407491121152> lol yeah pretty much and I have very little time so I will be avoiding it haha;;
So basically how these things normally work are.;;
You chat and you get XP to raise you rank in a certain discord and Twitch and Youtube are not a part of this at all.;;
When you raise you rank in discord you'll get something in discord (a colour, acces to a certain chat or something different);;
There's no real reward for actually trying to interact with other than streamers/Creators or other people in power. So everything there will have a conversation going from the bottom and up the hierarchy.;;
;;
"What I mean by ""To be honest i am more interested in a system, which also tried to track your interaction with other than streamers"" would be some sort of secondary system reading the lines, which are being written when streamers/creators are not around or are just lurking. something which could help people to just have a common goal. As an example I am a member of a discord for indie games and nothing happens in there and there's at least 300 people in there and my theory are a bit like there's nothing interesting to do as most are there to promote their stuff and there's nothing to incentivize conversations";;
Here's the wall <@136319407491121152>;;
"I plan on doing something similar to that but as a temporary placement untill I can think of a way to make the code work will be to have a way for a member to give another member ""rep"" so basically if one member thinks another member deserves recognition for something then they can ""award them points"". Then the more points you get the more things you unlock and incentives to drive the community to be involved in the system. So it sounds very similar to what you were saying lol";;
<@87241615671832576>^^;;
I wish I was technologically sound like you guys lol;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
good point <@416803598173995018>;;
lol I was just gonna keep posting that emoji until someone talked. This discord is dead;;
lets make our own;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
haha;;
btw saw your message that you not like americans who expect that everyone speak english;;
i personally HATE when someone doesnt speak english;;
im sure they have to;;
lol why do you hate that?;;
I just go in with the mentality that I am in a different country so I wouldnt expect them to speak my language;;
because no one can speak 10, 20 and more languages. so how can you communicate with people from others countries? right, through one language everyone knows;;
and when somebody doesnt know that language, it makes impossible to communicate;;
so yeah, i think everyone should know english;;
I suppose that's true. I wonder what the most common language is in the world;;
you serious???;;
its english;;
not everyones main language of course, but in many countries people learn english;;
according to google its 1. Chinese or mandarin 2. Spanish 3. English;;
Russian is #8;;
well thats not what i meant;;
world has 2 billion chinese?;;
I do feel like English is taught pretty much everywhere though;;
lol yeah I was just messing around <@207416847019016202>;;
taught in schools growing up I mean;;
english is language everyone communicate in, when they dont know each other language;;
I mean my grandmother was taught it in the 40's when she went to school in germany;;
yeah i know;;
in russia everyone learn english in school too;;
but nobody know it in real life;;
so no one remembers it after school?;;
i would rather say school doesnt actually teach you to speak it;;
you learn some word;;
some theory;;
you read;;
you kinda speak a little;;
but without practice or any reason to use it, its pointless;;
ahh ok, thats kind of how languages are taught here also;;
yeah;;
what kind of languages? spanish?;;
my school they offered if I remember correctly, spanish, french, german, russian, portuguese and arabic;;
not college I mean;;
now they only offer spanish and french I think;;
oh they offered mandarin too;;
to be honest im not too familiar with US school system, i dont really understad what is high school and what is college;;
in russia we go to school in about age of 7, in first class, and we end school in 11 class;;
and after that is university;;
some people drop after 9, and go to some kind of colleges;;
but mainly its 11;;
Popped in to see if there was a conversation going. It's just you two <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
its enough <@455797717763883009>;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> three is a crowd;;
lol hey <@455797717763883009>;;
<@207416847019016202> Its very different than that here;;
Haha hey  <@416803598173995018>;;
I can explain if you want;;
three oranges is not a crowd, its a revolution <@455797717763883009>;;
Damn. That should be on a t-shirt;;
we kinda used to call classes 8-11 as senior, or high school, but its no difference <@416803598173995018>;;
https://media.tenor.com/images/6a628e4f905aac8657b4f5a5793d0442/tenor.gif;;
11, that's a odd number;;
We had till 12th;;
Then university or a diploma;;
12 is less odd?;;
12 is even;;
even to what haha;;
Hahahah;;
actually im not sure if it is 11 or 10 years now, because when i was in school, there was no 4th grade (there are some disputes about 4th grade program), so it was 10 years;;
after that 4th grade was returned;;
and i dont know how it is now;;
10 or 11 years in school, and after that university;;
or army;;
Why no 4? Is it like an unlucky number or something?;;
well you know, each grade has its learning programm;;
Because 4 is unlucky in China;;
Ah;;
and they decided that program of 4th is not required;;
nothing about unlucky;;
Why not push everything back then? 5 becomes 4 and so on;;
lol ok good, I didnt feel like explaining the school system here;;
Lol;;
;;

The security check <@207416847019016202> , in Florida's international Airport;;
Nothing intentional, just that they swapped the basket where my computer was while it was going through the scanner...and they didn't tell me. I didn't not notice;;

Hey <@287320205020102667> how you doing?;;
Not too bad I suppose. Had one hell of a crazy work day lol and you;;
Lol not too bad after a crazy ass work day is pretty good! Not bad, just about to make some dinner.;;
Listen to this;;
<@416803598173995018>;;
I went get an empty trailer earlier to pick up a load. I look in the back and there is trash recycle paper everywhere. Mind you I‚Äôm already late for the appointment because I was busy looking for a trailer. So I call up the dispatcher and say hey look man I found an empty trailer but it‚Äôs full of trash I‚Äôm late for my appointment and it‚Äôs gonna take me at least an hour to clean this plus some paper is stuck to the floor and I don‚Äôt have the tools to remove it. He says well bring it anyway. I‚Äôm like dude they gonna reject it. Yeah but we can‚Äôt have you stay on a trailer hunt when you have one. I‚Äôm like whatever dude.  I get here and clean it took an hour or so. I go back and wait in my truck. 30 minutes later they call me in and tell me the trailer has been rejected. Lol;;
Oh damn that sucks man. All that work for nothing;;
So then they send me 80 miles to go swap out an empty trailer. 160 miles round trip. So I just get back here. And they are like nope not tonight come back at 7 in the morning lol.;;
<@416803598173995018>;;

oh that's awesome!;;
I'll be super happy to have you there and chat with you.;;
i'll also go to your streams;;
when are you usually streaming?;;
and what games?;;
I stream everyday except friday and saturday at the moment. Usually after 11pm, I live in LA. I am still a new streamer but I would consider myself a variety streamer. I usually play single player games with a great story. However, just recently I played multiplayer online like Apex with my viewers/regulars.;;
we're very alike then;;
I prefer story games as well;;
that's really cool;;
I started streaming Metro 2033 yesterday;;
great game;;
but 11pm LAtime is late af haha;;
Idk if you guys play last of us online, I recently got into that because one of my viewers wanted me to play with him online, really fun.;;
I know! It kind of sucks. Its not permanent. but it is the only time that currently works right now;;
hm. I didnt even know there was an online mode for the last of us lol;;
yeah it's ok;;
we have a few LA peeps here;;
<@409836692158021632> and <@416803598173995018> to name a couple;;

üòÇ;;
Overkill's Walking Dead Console edition has been cancelled. Damn;;

you're not missing out;;
haha;;
Feel bad for the devs though;;
For anyone who visited my stream thank you so much you are all awesome just wanted to apologize for that troll on chat but my mods are on top of it! Thank you for keeping it cool ^.^;;
Hey <@541966272561283082>;;
Dropped by this morning to leave a follow. As I couldn't watch the stream;;
<@409836692158021632> hey there man;;
I am alive!! Still haven't eaten solid food and the stitches suck but alive!!!!;;
Damn, i missed out of something. WHat has happened? and it's always nice to see people being alive;;
Well I had 6 teeth removed last week. 3 of which were wisdom. Late shift at work and so I haven't got to talk to the mango peeps or not network properly in a while..;;
Ahh damn, that's a rough one;;
My brother had 4 wisdom teeth removed and he was more or less drugged for a month;;
I'm wanting a Wendy's cheeseburger so bad..;;
Soup applesauce and pudding have been my diet;;
Oh I loved Wendy when it was in Russia;;
Was my favourite fastfood;;
Is it no longer in Russia?;;
Yeah;;
They closed;;
Aww dang;;
Apparently wasn't much success;;
It were only 8 restaurants in moscow;;
When McDonald's, kfc and burger king each has at least 100 I think;;
Sounds like Dunkin Donuts in Denmark, they went in all over and 6 months later they were all closed;;
Well it's a hit here.  Cause ya know merica I;;
Lol;;
Dublin donuts and crispy creme doing alright in moscow;;
Dunkin;;
Autocorrect;;
Now I want to create a chain called Dublin Do Nuts;;
Sounds like a band;;
But now I'm in Dubai mall, and its food court has Wendy's, so I'm about to taste it again;;
Eat one for me brother.. I want one so bad but alas the mouth still heals;;
I hope you'll enjoy and it's not Red taited glasses;;
Yall have a good night. I gotta head to bed for work. Have a pleasant day;;
But well I am off to read up on my Project management course;;
;;

http://www.riggedforepic.com/#/ape-out-review/;;
Green bananas are not ripe <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;

Looks good <@455797717763883009>;;
That guy looks like the B movie version of Indiana Jones lol;;
Lol yeah;;
Btw, i'll be in Como this weekend <@416803598173995018>;;
That's awesome! <@455797717763883009> we cant wait. We were gonna do Venice too but decided to just stay in Como and relax instead of running around Venice. We are just gonna eat food, drink wine and do nothing except enjoy the beauty of the area lol;;
Yeah Como is a better option for that;;
Venice will be like a stampede in June lol;;
https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1101069253590032385;;
lol yeah I figured. We are going to be so busy the week of the wedding so we dont want to deal with busy. We just want  to relax;;
NICE!;;
YES! Cyberpunk 2077, cant wait to see what they reveal;;
I think it's safe to say this is my most anticipated game coming out in the next year or so;;
also whats up? <@488734758847905803>;;
not much <@416803598173995018> ;;
finished that file i told you about yesterday and now i have to clean the house a bit;;
Noice, gotta get it clean for <@467974634977886220> ? lol;;
When Mrs. Changeover goes away, the house looks totally different cause I dont give a fuck haha;;
Its not gross but definitely not as tidy as when shes there;;
same <@416803598173995018>;;
omg if she saw the house now;;
yeah, i dont let it get dirty. I just get messy af;;
lol yeah I forgot to clean once when she got back, she wasnt appalled but it didnt go great haha;;
lmao;;
yeah messy, not dirty;;
I like to take like a case of water and tons of snacks and just set them by the tv and couch. I call it my snack corner.;;
Its cause Im too lazy to walk to the kitchen lol;;
so I make it convenient for myself. She thinks its ridiculous lol;;
so one time I forgot to put it away and it was just a pile of stuff by the couch hahaha;;
omggg youre my spirit animal;;
that corner behind my chair is my snack corner;;
and there's always wrappers and shit;;
Lmao yesssssss;;
My setup is way different than yours. I just have my ps4 and tv in the living room with the couch so it all goes there but same concept with the snacks lol. Once I move everything upstairs it will get so much worse cause I‚Äôll be even farther from the kitchen lol;;
lmao for realz;;
at least here I am close to the kitichen;;
but I cant be bothered with walking;;
fok that;;
and the toilet;;
lmfaaaaaaaaao;;
if i had a toilet in the living room i'd never leave;;
And yeah, i hope we get a release date for CP77 before E3;;
and a gameplay trailer for E3;;
oh man;;
yeah;;
some hands on and holiday release;;
thats one of those games I'm getting at launch;;
<@455797717763883009> luckily both locations are next to the toilet lol;;
But yeah fuck walking to the kitchen;;
That would be amazing <@455797717763883009>;;
lmao;;
yeah, i hope too;;
Spiderman was announced in April, released in Spetember;;
hope they do something similar;;
maybe they will;;
i can't remember how the witcher 3 was handled;;
a new CD Projekt Red triple-A RPG is on the way to release in 2021;;
Wow That trailer dr√∏m The sinking City. I guess they really went for one monotone protagonist;;
Which is not CP2077;;
So im hoping for 2019 release;;
And thank you <@416803598173995018> I need to find some energy somewhere;;
2021 might be that game that they're doing with Guerrila that I heard about;;
the devs of Horizon zero dawn;;
2019 release would be incredible;;
Witcher like game, without that title?;;
Because of the jerk author;;
yeah;;
piece of shit author;;
Yeah, I'll preorder in a heartbeat;;
Lol fuck that guy;;
NO ONE KNEW ABOUT HTE BOOOOOKS;;
omg;;
LAMO;;
LMAO;;
hahaha;;
if devs made a game about my book;;
He shouldve used it to his advantage;;
i'd suck their dick;;
Eh,they have announced they are working with him on something new;;
and  be like;;
gimme some more please;;
dafuqq lamfaooo;;
hahaha;;
I mean... no i wouldnt?;;
did they <@87241615671832576> ?;;
they wnt out and talked about it all and said, they are currently working together on something new;;
all i'm saying is i'd be grateful as hell;;
but it might be my mind makinga trick, I need to do some googlefu;;
you dare attempt at deceiving the MANGO?!;;
this will cost you your life blood;;
i don't have blood, just juice;;
and ofc the whole suing debacle was so big that everything else has been digged underneath;;
Last i heard was he was unsuccessful in getting money lol;;
https://www.cgmagonline.com/2018/07/12/new-witcher-game-in-development/;;
oh damn;;
maybe Ciri will be the protagonist?;;
though I honestly feel like she's overpowered;;
I suppose;;
I dont know how theyd balance the combat;;
and a 2021 release makes sense, coz they have all groundwork done;;
yeah thats true;;
they should have talked to George RR martin;;
get some game of thrones shit in there;;
Anyway i might have misread something. But Sapkowski and Cd PR has made a settlement though;;
So he has gotten some money;;
yeah not the 16million $ though;;
I really do not want any Game of Throne games from CD PR, they are good at finding interesting stuff and make it their own;;
Maybe not, none knows, as it's a closed deal;;
What was the GoT Tell tale all about?;;
I don't know, the stuff I watched about it wasn't that interesting;;
but i was more into the idea of making additions to a universe, that's essentially what they did to the Witcher as far as i understand;;
I still feel like i'd want a true Lord of the Ring thing, if it should be some big fantasy. But it'll never happen;;
<@455797717763883009> about a smaller northern house;;
I didnt play the entire game though;;
i'd like that as well <@87241615671832576> , but i think that won't happen either;;
Lol i don't watch GoT;;
But <@455797717763883009> I thought you where in the group of the cool kids üòâ;;
üòÇ;;
it's been a while since i've seen it, I tend to wait till the whole serie are released;;
I saw like 3 episodes;;
or at least enough, so I know I can grow tired of it;;
Put me to sleep, except for the sex scenes lol;;
I watched 3 seasons of breaking bad, and then I just lost interest;;
yeahh first season are pretty aweful;;
Breaking bad i could watch only after the 3rd try;;
But man, Better Call Saul is so good;;
I've not even given it a chance. I don't see the appeal, but i am also deep into the anime wagon at the moment;;
damn <@455797717763883009>;;
you should watchit;;
or read the books;;
Watching Mob Psycho?;;
I have the first book;;
need to read it;;
Fucking gamess, distracting me lol;;
yeah i know the feeling;;
so, as  crazy as it sounds;;
I found a really good laptop thats cheaper than desktops;;
the fuck?;;
https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Predator-Overclockable-Aeroblade-PH315-51-78NP/dp/B07CTHLX8C/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=helios%2B300&qid=1551369292&s=gateway&sr=8-1-spons&th=1;;
Lenovo?;;
nah;;
Acer;;
I'm eyeing the Legion Y740;;
ah 1060;;
are you sure thats the model?;;
ah ok;;
I thought lenovo wasnt considered a good brand;;
Good job <@!488734758847905803>, your dongle just grew to 31!;;
OH SHIT;;
Thats a nice build for the price;;
But thick bezels are soo 2015;;
what are thick bezels?;;
https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Legion-Y7000P-1060-Laptop-81LF0005US/dp/B07KWDZ5F6/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=lenovo+legion&qid=1551369715&s=gateway&sr=8-10;;
that fat frame around the screen lol;;
Same price Y7000. Same specs;;
except the ram, no? the ram for the one you sent is 8gb;;
oops yeah;;
https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Anti-Glare-i7-8750H-Processor-81LF0001US/dp/B07J26L99L/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=lenovo+legion&qid=1551369715&s=gateway&sr=8-3;;
A bit more for the16gb version;;
TRUE;;
a pc with those specs costs like 1500 USD;;
and doesnt come with a monitor;;
Yeah like wtf;;
lol;;
I'm starting to get concerned for my pc;;
since the stream glitched 2 days in a row;;
how old is it?;;
2 years;;
but the specs arent so great;;
it's a duo-core i7;;
<@87241615671832576> i love your idea for that follower alert;;
the cool thing about  my pc though <@455797717763883009> is that it's 17 inches;;
the screen;;
Ah, i have a 17 inch too;;
The Asus RoG;;
17 inch dongle you mean;;
Give me full authority and some chimps who can code and we'll make the best community bot in the world;;
lmao;;
thats bit bigger;;
lmao <@87241615671832576>;;
hahaha;;
yeah, mine is 17;;
ops, forgot the period;;
01.Ë˛Î;;
üçï;;
hahaha;;
But it could be interesting to sit down and try and structure a community bot;;
i have absolutely no knowledge on that;;
if there's anything i can do to help though;;
like i dont know...;;
cheering?;;
organizing?;;
i'd do it;;
That's my problem aswell üòÑ I can structure and organize, but programming is not possible;;
But <@488734758847905803> if you want to sit down and talk about ideas to make a community anything I'm always down for it. I am fascinated about how hard it is to make a good community, whcih can cross pollinate, as it's apperently not something you just do;;
How do you mean <@87241615671832576> ?;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
If you prefer you can send me a dm, but you can talk here as well;;
Changova;;
you gonna stream today mango?;;
Yep;;
In about an hour;;
niceeeee;;
I hope someone raids me to test the alert;;
The shit was getting on my nerves yesterday;;
I should have time to check in and chat\;;
lol yeah I bet;;
Wooooo;;
I'm just stalling with some house stuff for now;;
yeah gotta make it look nice lol. Gonna be weird for me to stream now without a cam now that everyone knows what I look like lol;;
Hahaha;;
Yeah I can imagine;;
Why don't you get a PS4 eye?;;
It can't be too expensive in the states;;
doesnt it look weird on twitch though? Like its just a tiny circle or something?;;
Depends on how you set it up;;
https://youtu.be/zAkfqsBKiQU;;
ahhh ok;;
This was when I still had a PS4 eye;;
whoa no beard!;;
lol you look so different;;
but ok thats pretty good. I didnt know you could change the set up. That could be an option for sure. I think its only like $50 here for one;;
there's no secrets <@488734758847905803> so it's discussable. I've just noticed alot of crossover people from Jonny, You and Nor. and I guess there's other communities where there's a similar crossover of people where I do not reside.  ;;
So the idea would in more general be like, how to make all of these viewers not have 8-10 different channels with almost the same people. Why not promote all like you do now and help eachother out even more and get the most active people, who wants to help, help out.;;
But again it really dpends on the streamers aswell;;
I feel like each community has a few different rules and preferences;;
Even though there's a crossover of people;;
And also, the crossover isn't too large I think. ;;
Maybe around 10-15 people?;;
I do understand what you mean though, it would also make it easier to chat and organize what people say;;
But on the other hand, you have to decide things together;;
Which can make it slow and stuff, albeit more democratic;;
I am open to talk and discuss this matter further though, because maybe that particular view of mine is incorrect;;
Given I haven't thought about it much;;
<@416803598173995018>;;
About the different face haha;;
Yeah that's when I still accepted interpretation work and had to meet clients and shit;;
Fuck that;;
<@488734758847905803> can you mute the mic on the eye and use your headset?;;
Yes;;
lmao you look a lot different;;
ok cool;;
just not sure how id use it cause I have the tv and then the couch a few feet away right now. Might be too far to see me or anything;;
Get a chair and sit cloee;;
Or;;
Put the camera close to you, the cable is fairly long iirc;;
I don't have mine anymore, I sold it;;
oh ok, I didnt know how long the cord was. yeah I could just move it closer to me;;
not a bad idea for the time being. I forgot all about it lol;;
Haha yeah a lot of people do;;
It's not the best, but it's better than nothing and not too expensive;;
i read it for 3 times and cant fully understand wht you meant. could you please elaborate a little more <@87241615671832576> ?;;
i agree that 3 communities has some crossover people, and i agree with mango that its like 10-15 people, but i cant really understand what is your suggestion. Who should do, and what he should do? Help who and how?;;
<@207416847019016202> rageeee;;
Sort of like a conglomerate channel;;
Jonny's Norwegian Mango;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah could be a good option;;
i think in twitch streams this community already united <@455797717763883009> ;;
because all the same people watching everyone;;
<@207416847019016202>  Go back to school, you skipped 4th grade <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Yeah, it's true we all chat on twitch when someone is streaming;;
but if its about discord, i dotnt get what the point. everybody choses server that he feels he want to spend more time in;;
and most of us has that one conglomerate channel - it called ACG. and also some of us silent there because its too much people;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
The thing is not about making one channel and that's it. it will never work, due to the reasons Mango mentioned and, just because you like to watch jonny doesn't mean  you like to watch mango, so everything has to be separated, in a way. What I was talking about, how to make everything easy in choice, I currently have around 20 channels I am in. ;;
if I could boil those down to around 5 I'd be happy especially if everything had a wider view. And the ACG channel are not a conglomerate channel, as it's paywalled, so not everyone in these channels are in them. ;;
;;
What I am talking about is in extension of the thing about a bot I talked with Axfocal about. A system, which will help people choose where to be and reward you as a person because you are active and awesome and not because you have made freinds with the streamers/content creators;;
which is why I am fascinated about online communities, bacause when do they actually work? When you have a critical mass of people who have the same interest and want to be a part of it;;
i still dont understand details;;
if I could boil those down to around 5 I'd be happy especially if everything had a wider view;;
what does it mean?;;
i mean, okay, its not about making one channel.;;
but... this hypothetical bot, in which channels it should work? <@87241615671832576>;;
im not disagree or something, i just want to get specific details, not common idea, because i got common idea;;
Maybe like a personal ranking system of the channels you're in? ;;
Most active ;;
Least active;;
I am only in 5 channels totally üòÇ;;
 ranking system of the channels you're in;;
that makes sense but im not sure its possible. but i dont know of course, didnt read discord api;;
Imagine you have a community of 10 creators, who all have their own schedules and they all use discord. ;;
All of these creators like to talk to eachother, but have each their own channels as they all have a different focus of their creation.;;
All creators are interested in crosspollination of their channels, with people who genuinely like the channels.;;
;;
So the first question would be how to gather the relevant people in one channel and making it good?;;
I don't believe you can do that. But I do believe you can put everyone in a pool and they select who they'll be a part of. So when you join the *main channel' - Which are a welcome channel - You assign a rank to yourself, which will unlock the sub community channel for the person you want to follow.;;
;;
That's the broad spectre, afterwards you can earn rewards by interaction.;;
Note, this is without any bot system, what we talked about at that part was a bot who could track you overall as you wanted it to track you.;;
So it would be able to track your interactions in Twitch, Youtube and Discord if you where interested.;;
Okay, I got basics at least - one server for server owners;;
The general idea is, if you have 10 people who all pick people up all over the internet and bring them into a community where they can start discover other good content creators, you'd both get people who are interested in the sam and make new freinds + meet other creators;;
I'll screenshot this so I can think later on it;;
1 server for 10 creators, 1 channel with sub channel for each creater. All channels are invicible unless you have the corrent rank;;
i have thought about making a flow chart, it might be easier to see;;
Hey <@136319407491121152> ;;
I read that you're writing a bot and having troubles. What language do you use?;;
<@207416847019016202> hey I'm writing in JavaScript and Json;;
Oh JavaScript;;
I'm in no way insist, but if you would want, I could throw in some help;;
I know JavaScript pretty average, even poorly, but  I got some skills generally;;
Sure I'll pm you some of my code and see what you think. I'm trying to iron out some errors and a second set of eyes could always help. Thank you for offering;;
Oh good. I'll be back from vacation in a week and will be able to check it out  <@136319407491121152>;;
But you can dm it when you want, maybe I will check it out here;;
Ok no worries <:axfocaHeart:489178587346501661> I'm going to be tinkering with it more and more tonight. üòÅ I'm excited;;
Yeah I know that feeling;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Does anyone here have any experience with the net gear powerline 1200?;;
I only have experience with loud noises <@416803598173995018>;;
lol yeah howd that work out?;;
sorry <@416803598173995018> ;;
I wish I did and I'd help you out;;
All good man, think I got the gist of it. Just wasn't sure how good or bad it was. The reviews are super mixed;;
yeah man, definitely!;;
you need that good internet to stream that Mango Bio Butter goodness from <@488734758847905803> ;;
<:PM:539114910211112995> üòÇ;;

Welcome under the shade of the mango tree  <@275429891774742531>!!!!;;

happy to have you here with us;;
Glad to be here;;
How do you know if a streamer is bad cus if I‚Äôm just a bad streamer I may hang up my webcam;;
I think you can only be bad if you dont talk to people or interact with chat and just sit there and play in silence lol. Its hard to be a bad streamer in my opinion;;
Just dropped you a follow by the way;;
I‚Äôm not so sure my development has stagnated and halted and even though I have been streaming for almost a year I have little to show for it and only two regulars so I‚Äôm not sure;;
Thank you;;
Its hard man, stick with it if its what you wanna do;;
<@432661245066477583> it's all about the people you meet;;
we are super supportive here so we will all help as much as we can;;

I think it's good that you brought it up <@432661245066477583> ;;
I think we all want people to be there and watch ;;
I think the people here honestly try their best to watch and support one another so you're not alone on that front;;
It‚Äôs gonna be soon it will be either hollow knight or Gta sa;;
Good job <@!432661245066477583>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;

lol yeah it‚Äôs 1920 here. So hard to keep track of time zones here;;
Hey <@525710142294196254> !;;
It really is! And makes it hard to catch some streamers due to it (cos I‚Äôm either at work or sleeping üòÑ);;
Hi <@488734758847905803> üòä. How are you going?;;
Yeah I have a few people who try to watch my streams that are in Australia and it‚Äôs tough for them;;

Glad to see you guys in here;;
<@541966272561283082> I know the pain of streaming with glasses;;
Neeeeerd;;
My glasses fuck up my depth perception so I can‚Äôt okay games using them lol;;
My lenses do that sometimes to me.;;
But glasses reveal my nerdiness;;
Not the video game tattoos? Lol;;
Hahaha;;
;;
Look at that nerd;;
That's the real mango;;
If Messi majored in science;;
Lmaaao;;
I've actually heard a lot of people say I look like Messi;;
Once someone said I looked like Jonny Depp if he did a shitton of coke and got aids;;
I was really torn between being insulted and complimented;;
Hot Messi;;
Johnny Derp;;
Hahahaha Jesus that‚Äôs an aggressive comment from that person;;
Lmao <@409836692158021632>;;
Yeah it was;;
Jonny deep dongle hahaha;;
You're a foking sexy nerd Sir Purple of Dongle;;
HAhahaah;;
Why thank you;;
Your controller art is awesome as well;;
As is your sword-wielding character;;
Haha;;
It's not as sexy as the Dongle of the North;;
Is that me? Cause mango is south lol;;
Dongle of the north;;
Yeah it could be <@416803598173995018> haahha;;

Get a room you two, geeez;;
I totally agree, but I think a lot of people stream in silence  <@416803598173995018>;;
Hahahahah;;
Join us <@416803598173995018> ;;
<@467974634977886220> can watch me do stuff to you;;
Some people prefer silent streams, but I personally do not prefer overly silent ones;;
yeah some do. especially the one who cares about gameplay;;
<@207416847019016202> yeah that‚Äôs true. I do like to watch some streamers who just focus on the game and they‚Äôre so good at it, it‚Äôs almost mesmerizing.;;
<@488734758847905803> lmao I read that wrong the first time. I didn‚Äôt catch you said she will watch you do stuff to me hahahahaha;;
<@488734758847905803> I get too focused at times and I'm like oh yeah I'm not alone lol;;
Goodnight everyone hope you had a great day;;
I‚Äôm the same! Get so focused and when I go back to edit the video I realise I haven‚Äôt spoken much üòÑ;;

Doh;;
<@446411352035033089> Nice, happy birthday!! üéÇ;;
<@456226577798135808> I feel ya lol;;
Yeah. It‚Äôs been a long week;;
So who all is playing the Division 2 Beta?;;
If it still has the same audio issues that I experienced in the private beta, that will be a bit disappointing.;;
dohhh;;
I am gonna play it right now after having a few internet issues with ubisoft club;;
feelzbad;;
are you on xbox or ps4 <@456226577798135808> ?;;
X;;
I prob won‚Äôt be on until later this afternoon or tonight.;;
I am curious if the same bugs are still present. I spent a good amount of time in the private;;
I'm guessing audio bugs won't be there by launch time;;
but what do i know lol;;
I am also on xbox for the division beta;;
<@456226577798135808> I will be downloading it when I get home today;;
Knowing ubisoft, bugs we be very prominent lol;;
Yeah I do hope they fix it. I enjoyed what I played;;
Graphically it looks better;;
Once I heard they will be bringing in a Winter DLC I got pumped. The colds snowy streets of NY in the 1st one really set that dark dreary mood for me.;;
Parts of D2 are a bit vibrant. Lol;;
I want bodies hanging from trees. Hold on, maybe they did have that in D2;;
what issues did you have? I didnt have any so far;;
holy shit the division 1 is dirt cheap;;
Oh shit. I had everything from audio delays when firing guns to explorations to Enemy NPCs Beating on NPCs that weren‚Äôt visible.;;
The big ones though were NPCs not showing up or not talking to progress some missions.;;
Since the dialogue wasn‚Äôt working a door to progress the mission wouldn‚Äôt open.;;
I had texture and pop in problems;;
Seeing through wall to under the game world;;
It‚Äôs all on my Twitch VODs if ur curious;;
Classic Ubisoft lol;;
I love them but they never cease to amaze me with their bugs lol.;;
I'll check it out;;
but this seems good so far;;
I am actually legit sad I have to stop playing haha;;
cause I have to clean;;
fok my messy ways;;
had I tidied everything up before, i would be able to play now;;
curses;;
didnt you clean all day yesterday too? lol;;
<@416803598173995018> Yea, during the Private I looked on the forums and there was a list of issues as long as a football field.;;
I mean I guess thats the point of a beta, hopefully they can work them all out before the release;;
At least they didn't call it early access;;
Yeah <@416803598173995018> I did;;
Though today is more organizing and dishes;;
I did laundry and stuff yesterday;;
Cleaned the bathroom;;
<@488734758847905803> not exactly fun lol but that‚Äôs okay sorry I passed out again my head is killing me;;
It's ok <@524820041976250368>;;
Sorry to hear about your head;;
It‚Äôs okay, how‚Äôre you? <@488734758847905803>;;
I'm good;;
Excited for <@467974634977886220> to come home today;;
Oh yay!;;
Lol damn <@488734758847905803> must have been a lot to clean;;
<@524820041976250368> he‚Äôs excited but really, he wishes it was me coming home to him;;
Bahaha!  <@416803598173995018> totally agree;;
Normally Betas from my experience are stress tests and maybe some minor bugs. What I feel I experienced went beyond that for a Beta. With that said, I was able to restart the game and progress through the one mission that wasn't activated by the dialogue. We'll see how the Open Beta goes;;
Good job <@456226577798135808>, your dongle just grew to 6!;;

400$ cheaper and works like a beauty;;
ah thats a nice pc!;;
though my option needs to be portable;;
so either a laptop or a mini;;
sad trombone;;
I travel a lot, that's why;;
Ah I see that‚Äôs unfortunate;;
yeah, otherwise i'd be all over a desktop by now;;
lol <@488734758847905803> and how does that make her feel? Im trying to find a good monitor now to use with my PS4, trying to stay under $130USD;;

Hello all;;
Hope everyone is good here;;
<@488734758847905803> damn man! I looked all morning and didnt see that lol. I was looking at 23 inch monitors, thats probably why;;
Whats up? <@348165887347523594>;;
I'm alright here. I'm trying to catch up with work.;;
And life lol;;
Yesterday I played a whole lot of anthem so I can finish the campaign and move on to something else. I doubt I'll ever come back to it if nothing changes. I should be near the last mission from what I heard.;;
Damn that's sad about anthem;;
yeah coming back from vacation is never fun lol;;
glad to help <@416803598173995018>;;
damn <@348165887347523594>;;
<@525710142294196254> happy birthday!;;
<@287320205020102667> I just saw your message it didn't notify me on my phone sorry for the late response üò≠ busy work day. Ill pm to help you niw;;
<@136319407491121152> it's <@446411352035033089> 's bday haha;;
Whoops <@446411352035033089> happy birthday! Lol;;
Thanks  <@488734758847905803> <:axfocaHeart:489178587346501661>;;
<@488734758847905803> only $20 for the 23 inch one of that monitor. Done! Gonna talk to the wifey tonight about getting that and the ps4 eye;;
I have this laptop a client gave me just before I left so I could just reinstall windows 10 on it. It was working when he gave it to me. Now the thing just won't post.;;
I'm just going to take a nap and figure this thing later.;;
nice <@416803598173995018> !!;;
yeah nap for the win! <@348165887347523594>;;
üòâ;;
I‚Äôve been looking at going the PC route and my god, trying to build one is not only expensive but confusing as hell lol;;
yeah it is super confusing;;
$235 for everything I need <@488734758847905803> thats reasonable;;
how much is the ps4 eye?;;
I mean it would be nice but damn.;;
yeah <@456226577798135808> ;;
good thing about it (if you dont travel as much as I do) is that you can go slowly;;
PS4 eye?;;
and put it together piece by piece;;
<@456226577798135808> same. I wanted to build one this year but I have absolutely no clue what Im doing;;
True and a good point. Don‚Äôt have to do it all at once. I just have to understand what I am building. Ha;;
<@488734758847905803> $44.99;;
Monitor is $109 and that internet thing so I can get internet upstairs is $82;;
<@456226577798135808> camera for the ps4. Only one that works on ps4 without a capture card;;
yeah.;;
karak can help you out in hte ACG discord;;
he helped me figure these things out;;
Nah just wing it and hope for the best;;
youll need a welder for sure too;;
<@136319407491121152> thank you i turn 24 today!! <:chickn4Glazer:550135960344592394>;;
I meant for <@456226577798135808>  <@416803598173995018> hahaha;;
your stuff is easy;;
lol yeah I know, I was being sarcastic about building a PC;;
sarcasm is tough over text lol;;
building a PC is easy, its selecting the right parts that will work well together that takes a bit of time and research;;
What about for someone who has zero knowledge about PC's? Im planning on building one later this year or next year;;
Its not hard at all, watch a couple of youtube videos (not the verge) and you should be good to go;;
<@416803598173995018> go prebuilt if you have don't wanna spend time on research. You Americans have a lot of good options <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Lol Verge;;
<@275429891774742531> ok cool. I figured stuff would be up on youtube. No clue who verge is but I will avoid him lol <@455797717763883009> yeah was thinking that too, at least for my first PC;;
I dont mind the time though and I think it would fun and cool to build one;;
I like building stuff and challenges so I will probably go that route when I do it;;
What's your budget? <@416803598173995018>;;
20yrs ago my friend showed me how to change a HDD in my puter and I was so shocked how easy it was I then built my first puter 1 month later;;
<@455797717763883009> right now? $0 lol;;
Lmao;;
can I post a pic in here?;;
Yes you can  <@275429891774742531>;;
got a wedding to pay for lol. Thats why I said later this year or next I will build one;;
Haha I get it;;
Run a potato until then;;
Im pushing it with trying to get a cam and a monitor to stream on my ps4 right now lol;;
;;
Good job <@!275429891774742531>, your dongle just grew to 1!;;
that is me now üòõ;;
Looks clean as fuck!;;
ohh that is dirty;;
I need to do some work;;
Damn sweet rig;;
lol looks good to me at least then;;
What cooling is that?;;
custom hard line water cooling;;
burned my fingers plenty bending those tubes;;
pain builds character! lol;;
Thought it was custom. Nice! I'll probably end up getting something prebuilt.;;
Coz I'm lazy as fuck üêº;;
I need to change the cooling fluid soon and it will be a deeper blue and there will be a plate on the bottom with lighting effects to cover those cables on the bottom;;
I will be doing a video montage when its finished;;
That's sweet, cant wait to see;;
I wish I was better with technology lol;;
<@488734758847905803> gonna play some apex when I get home today around 1500 my time. Think you'll be around?;;
<@207416847019016202> when are you back from vacation?;;
"I started a new skyrim character called ""the donglevahkiin""";;
lol that's awesome <@!498246547838992414>;;
I havent played skyrim in 6 years;;
You had a pretty good stream yesterday didnt you? <@!498246547838992414> how are you doing on your affiliate goals?;;
<@416803598173995018> perhaps I will be;;
lmao  <@!498246547838992414>;;

if so, i would also like to see it;;
I should be on for about an hour then and an hour again around 1730 I think;;
cool;;
bad day to be <@207416847019016202>;;

lmao once he gets back though, hes gonna tear it up;;
i dunno;;

<@409836692158021632> the dongle is strong and hard today;;
nah;;
ready for the weekend;;
<@207416847019016202> ;;
you've been dethroned, comrade!;;
yes;;
communism is not for kings;;
lol no it is not;;
more of a dictatorship lol;;
haha;;
it wasnt necessarily supposed to be;;
buuuuut;;
yeah thats what happens;;
Sounds good on paper but just doesnt work lol;;
I have to talk alot today to take the #3 place from kelly. Even if its just for a few minutes, I will be happy lol;;
so Im gonna spam it up in here today;;
just talk about <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
I dont wanna summon him;;
lot's of stuff to talk about with that guy...;;
If you look in the mirror and say his name 3 times, he appears;;
hahaha;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> ;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> ;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
oh god, what have you done!;;
hahahahaha;;
<@409836692158021632> nooooo;;
I know he's seeing all of this and just waiting for the right moment to strike;;
also <@416803598173995018> - communism has some good things, imo (in the manifesto), but in practice I dont like too much.;;
I prefer european models of socialism in general that I know of;;
"like Switzerland's and Germany's ""hybrid""";;
Yeah exactly, me too. Thats why I hope Bernie Sanders or Kamala Harris wins the election in 2020 because they want to implement a system like that;;
BERNIEEE;;

"I wish you could do a ""travel"" stream while you're there, Orange";;
we miss the hate;;
plan for today is sleeping, its 11 pm here <@409836692158021632>;;
Sleep is for the weak;;
we discovered a lot of parts of town;;

Probably;;

Perfect;;

Good job <@!432661245066477583>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;

Yep;;
a <@537319907541516311> interview would be hilarious!;;
the first 30 minutes will be him figuring out his audio issues;;
Ha get rekt;;
hahahhaah;;
yeah for sure;;
and another hour - <@488734758847905803> tech issues;;
stop jinxing meeeee;;
I never heard of this fruit, but judging by the name, it's Not Orange. Is it you mango?;;
if its not clear on photo, sign says Narange;;
clementine?;;
ah;;
then I guess it is an orange lol;;
its very different looking in real life;;
It‚Äôs a tangerine maybe;;
nope;;
its not clementine or mandarine or tangerine;;
what do you know about fruit anyway <@207416847019016202> ?;;
you hate them;;
its orange sized;;
like everything;;
but oranges skin usually much smoother than this;;
I enjoy a good taco myself;;
i dont hate my gf, and she loves fruits <@488734758847905803> ;;
its basically what we buy a lot each day;;
Lmao <@409836692158021632> we finally got it figured out on our last stream though!;;
what did <@416803598173995018> ?;;
lol <@432661245066477583> - you veggie fish taco;;
I see <@207416847019016202>;;
The audio issues we had wig skydaze and a dual stream;;
With not wig;;
Fuck it‚Äôs hard to keep up on mobile app lol;;
im sure theres a wig involved <@416803598173995018>;;
For skydaze yeah;;
oooooo damn so now skydaze can chat and stream with his mic?;;
niiice;;
I like redheads and he‚Äôs got brown hair so;;
Lol yeah <@488734758847905803>;;
I don‚Äôt think he knows how he fixed it but he did so it‚Äôs all good;;
hahah;;
doesnt matter how;;
yeah it will matter a lot next time when problem appears;;
Would be nice to know how though for any future references lol;;
hahaahahaha;;
Yeah exactly <@207416847019016202>;;
<@416803598173995018> -  I can help you witht hat maybe.;;
I feel like i told skydaze to do everything I did, but that didnt work;;
so maybe now it will?;;
It‚Äôs cause he‚Äôs British, that‚Äôs why it didn‚Äôt work;;
I think it worked when he finally plugged in the mic on his headset;;
üòÇ;;
haha <@409836692158021632>;;
Evening people!;;
yeah i heard usually it helps;;
evening <@87241615671832576>;;
hey hey <@87241615671832576>;;
hey <@87241615671832576> !;;
Anyone going for division2?;;
if there's time this weekend, Lands;;
I want to see the differences it has from Div 1;;
Sounds cool, it does seem like the first Looter shooter, which will not be released in a wierd state;;
will you be playing it, Lands?;;
lol <@409836692158021632> yeah it was probably something that simple;;
Ubisoft knows how to make cinematic intros;;
I am currently trying to jump in and test out if I get th same wierd bugs as in the previous beta;;
Loved the Div2 intro video;;
Yo  <@87241615671832576>;;
Hey <@87241615671832576>;;
and hello to everyone aswell üòÑ;;
<@455797717763883009> very true, their intros are awesome;;
They are, i am also interested in knowing if they make a good story. I always feel like Ubi games have a Meh story;;
but it's awesome to see the cinematic being on par with the game;;
The old Assasins creed I feel had decent stories but the last 2 in my opinion, have been lacking;;
My problem with the past several AC have been that its just too repetitive. I got bored soooo quickly with origins. I didnt even bother buying odyssey;;
people said odyssey is waaaay better than origins <@416803598173995018>;;
It looked better. Luckily I bought origins for $19 and my friend has odyssey so when hes done with it, hes gonna let me borrow it so we will see;;
Im really excited for ghosts of tsushima. It has an AC feel but its samurai's which is so badass;;
ghost of tsushima;;
Kind of reminds of Onimusha;;
gonna inject that right into my dongle;;
for real!;;
you ever play onimusha?;;
no;;
never even heard of it;;
oh fuck, that game was amazing~;;
!*;;
Speaking of AC, I guess I should try and play Black Flag again;;
capcom made it and it was ancient japan and you fought elemental and spiritual enemies. so much fun and so difficult;;
Ninja Gaiden was another good one bu that game was so fucking hard;;
<@87241615671832576> was black flag any good?;;
what platform <@416803598173995018> ?;;
ninja gaiden i thought sucked;;
at least the one i played;;
i don't know I played for 5 hours and never reallly came back;;
ps2 <@488734758847905803> and ninja gaiden was xbox I believe;;
<@87241615671832576> ahh ok, Ive had that experience several times lol. I did that with the AC based in colonial times, I think it was 3;;
I think I might have not been in the mood for a collectathon;;
Yeah Ive been that way before. AC 3 for me the controls and camera angles were sooooo bad and missions just werent fun, even from the beginning so I gave up after a day or two of playing it;;
for me black flag was the best at the time;;
i cleaned up everything there i think;;
I didnt play that one. AC2 was my favorite personally;;
So, i literally barely moved since i said i was gonna clean;;
so now it's really time to clean;;
lmao dude get off your ass!;;
you gonna stream today?;;
I am;;
but later;;
I thought <@467974634977886220> was gonna be home around now;;
but her parents are dealing with some house stuff it seems;;
Oi;;
ol√°;;
oh damn, hope everything is ok <@488734758847905803>;;
oi! <@!498246547838992414>;;
yeah it's just cleaning stuff <@416803598173995018>;;
nothing drastic;;
or bad;;
hah;;
I have the next week completely free off school!!!;;
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT;;
*YEEEEEEEET*;;
time to grab my virtual dongle every foking day;;
oh ok thats not bad, thought it was like issues with the house;;
Yaaaassss;;
yeah haha;;
<@!498246547838992414> nice! I remember those days lol;;
Love vacation;;
yeah enjoy them;;
adults dont get those;;
Not gonna do shiiiiit;;
unless youre like me, and you literally have no work to do on a friday cause freelancing;;
oof;;
<@488734758847905803> we do get them but theyre not the same lol. Now you have responsibilities and shit;;
<@488734758847905803>  did you finish all three missions?;;
Good job <@!455797717763883009>, your dongle just grew to 17!;;
thats why streaming full time is the goal lo;;
lol*;;
nice dongle <@455797717763883009> growing fast;;
MEE6 loves my dongle;;
I think we all love your dongle üòâ;;
üòÇ;;
I think thats what I miss most about being a kid or even in college, When you had vacations you could just do nothing cause you had nothing to worry about. Id play games all day for like a week straight. Theres no way I could do that now, I could do maybe a day or two lol;;
Fooking sad;;
Yeah only weekends here;;
And I can manage without cooking from Friday evening to Saturday maybe, then I start dying lol;;
I do weekdays but only for 2 hours if Im lucky. I can do full day gaming maybe once a month, other than that its just in short periods;;
lmao you dont eat from friday to saturday?;;
Yeah weekdays after dinner for like 2 hours . Been doing that with Odyssey now;;
Haha nope, just junk food;;
lol ohh ok haha;;
Or pizza lol;;
I definitely used to do that lol;;
Mostly take out;;
Hahah these Italians make nice pizza;;
still do, just once in awhile;;
yeah I have heard they are good lol;;
are you originally from there?;;
Almost every weekend. Unless I'm tired as fuck. I end up sleeping until Saturday noon;;
Originally from India;;
Ahh ok, very cool! Howd you end up in italy?;;
Came here for my Master's degree;;
Ended up getting a job;;
Damn thats really awesome. Wish I had thought of doing that lol but I dont think my degree would have been helpful anywhere but in the states;;
You could still do it;;
What did you specialise in?;;
Originally it was criminal justice but now I am in account management and finances;;
but I want to get into esports or video game companies;;
a college right by me actually just started and esports management class so I will take that in the summer and hope I can make connections through that and get a job that way;;
of the division 2 <@455797717763883009> ? no;;
yeah i know;;
adulting sucks <@416803598173995018>;;
Ah that's cool. You could do that . I would like to be part of a video game studio too;;
<@488734758847905803> yes and no. Yes because you have responsibilities but also, you can do whatever you want for the most part lol;;
<@488734758847905803> the cinematic?;;
<@455797717763883009> yeah I definitely am, its not that expensive either and the people who teach it work at blizzard, twitch etc so the connections you make would be amazing;;
That's why I like America, all that shit is happening there;;
But then there's Trump <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;

I can think of 5 major companies within an hour of where I live;;

Ooo whiskey ü•É;;
Damn;;
I'm gonna try my luck at Ubisoft Barcelona next year;;
Blizzard, EA, Activision, Riot, Respawn and Santa Monica;;
Ubisoft is everywhere lol;;
and yes, love me some whiskey;;
I have developed a taste lately for bourbon;;
No, no, no, no, maybe, HELL YEAH;;
I just found out I'm going to Italy next summer, so yay;;
<@498246547838992414> that's some major future planning;;
lol yeah the first 3 places I listed arent great. Riot is cool but I dont like league of legends so;;
That's how we do it here  <@455797717763883009>;;
thats awesome <@!498246547838992414> yeah some serious future planning lol;;
it must be pretty boring to be belgian;;
It is  <@207416847019016202>;;
Lol;;
I like Belgium;;
Especially Bruges;;
I didn't summon him guys but he's here...;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
<@207416847019016202>get back to your camel ride;;
I think I liked too many of his instagram photos...;;
‚ù§ <:Orange:545555843978887170> ‚ù§ <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
I like Belgium too, and Bruges is really really beautiful (for west-flanders) XD;;
Haha;;
Been to Brussels twice;;
Lol everybody either hates Antwerp or West-Flanders here;;
Antwerp was okay ish;;
haha yeah thanks for that <@409836692158021632> ;;
i dont post to instagram usually;;
Haha;;
Brussels is good for visiting, but not to live in, antwerp the same  <@455797717763883009>;;
I suppose;;
<@455797717763883009> I actually just applied for a project manager position with respawn, probably wont get it but you never know lol;;
You never know buddy!  <@416803598173995018>;;
I need to travel Europe more;;
Good luck with that;;
Its such a process to get there from LA;;
and expensive lol;;
Go to West-Flanders if you want to see living Neanderthals, go to Antwerp if ypu want to go to SJW central (this is how Belgians think about eachother lol);;
this is also the reason why my fiance and I want to live there for a few years;;
so we can travel lol;;
<@416803598173995018> i was supposed to study in SCI-Arc;;
<@207416847019016202> why are you still awake? lol;;
What is that? <@455797717763883009>;;
oh nice <@416803598173995018> !;;
I was looking at the Respawn jobs last week too;;
Southern California Institute of Architecture lol;;
They have a lot of positions up <@409836692158021632> I just dont have the qualifications for 95% of them lol;;
ahh ok <@455797717763883009>;;
In the Arts District;;
yeah they had a few QA spots;;
Yeah I know infinity ward has QA positions listed all the time too but they are contract;;
They always post jobs that no-one has qualifications for;;
oh nice <@455797717763883009>;;
yeah, the ones in Respawn were 1 year contracts too;;
<@455797717763883009> ok now I know where you mean. I dont get around too much in that area so;;
<@498246547838992414> lol I've only had good times in Belgium;;
Damn you guys know your beer;;
<@409836692158021632> ahh ok, is that common with QA?;;
I like beer;;
Yeah was supposed to come there. But expensive as fuck;;
yeah that's common with QA;;
Think around $120,000;;
ahh ok, I had an interview with square enix last year for a qa position but turned it down because of they pay. It was half of what I made at the time so;;
120,000 for the school? <@455797717763883009>;;
oh yeah, I forgot Square Enix is by LAX;;
yeah that commute also would have sucked lol;;
Konami is in the same area too, I think;;
But if the pay was better, I would have done it;;
Yeah  <@416803598173995018>;;
Oh wow I forgot about Konami;;
I guess, don't remember the exact conversion;;
thats about right for college here lol;;
Wait let me check;;
Its not cheap;;
especially medical or law school;;
Yeah it is that much, excluding my personal expenses;;
1yr of med schools is more than 4yr of college;;
lol yep <@275429891774742531>;;
That's why I chose Italy;;
My friend finished med school last year and I think hes over $300,000 in debt from it;;
I can atleast imagine paying that loan lol;;
I took MCAT waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back when;;
smart decision <@455797717763883009>;;
Fuck, I'd be stressing out on it every day;;
lol yeah his payments each month are crazy;;
why i should not be awake? <@416803598173995018>;;
he luckily makes a lot being a doctor but still ,its alot;;
because isnt it late there? <@207416847019016202> I think you miss us;;
Yeah now I have like 25,000‚Ç¨ left;;
Awww look he has feelings, guys!;;
Thats not too bad <@455797717763883009>;;
Holy shit <@455797717763883009>;;
What?n;;
Dubai never sleeps.  <@207416847019016202> did you go on top of Burj?;;
Not bad?;;
its 1 am <@416803598173995018>;;
Yeah not bad üòÇ;;
oh ok, thats not late;;
Whoa;;
Not going to college - mango wins;;
<@488734758847905803> I had close to $80,000 when I finished school lol;;
Fuck;;
If I had decided to goto US of A. I'd be owing 10 times more lol;;
Yeah for sure;;
The good old U S of A!;;
My aunt pays 1000 usd a month;;
And doesn't even put a dent in it;;
my college went up dramatically in the past few years too;;
But her job is going to pay it off in another year or two;;
yep I know that feeling <@488734758847905803>;;
no, we decided not to do any pricy tourist stuff. <@455797717763883009> ;;
we saw everything around there many times, explored every possible pedestrian way there (and theres not a lot), so its fine for us;;
my math was wrong, it was abut $55,000 when I was done;;
Ou;;
Oh*;;
still not good lol;;
Yeah paying my loan is like a grind;;
lol yeah it is;;
Enemies keep spawning in the same spot lol;;
World of college craft;;
Lmao;;
The Revision 2;;
Hahahahahaha;;
My cousin's wife went to medical school and then did speciality stuff after and by the time she was done, almost 10 years of school. I think she was close to 1 million in student loans;;
Wow;;
Why not move?;;
Fuck;;
Fuck loans man;;
I'd move to another country and change my name;;
Maybe Russia;;
in russia doctors learn 7 years i think;;
And stay outside  <@207416847019016202> apartment;;
come here <@455797717763883009>;;
She wanted to go to those schools. It paid off, shes the chief of brain surgery at a really good hospital now and makes bank;;
change your name to OverFiveFootPanda;;
lol;;
"Like, ""here, make a life-changing decision when you're 19, and oh you're done with college? Here's a debt for the rest of your life. Hope you chose your favorite major !""";;
Lol;;
i got good food court near my appartment <@455797717763883009>;;
lol for real <@488734758847905803>;;
and most degrees dont do shit. I barely learned anything from mine;;
Perfect, McDonald's everyday;;
3$ per day;;
I literally told everyone I had a college degree;;
haha 3 not enough;;
No one ever asked for jt;;
Good thing I was always a nerd;;
Don't you have the $ burger?;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> üçî üçü;;
A grammar nerd;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> üí¶ ;;
üí© ;;
üöΩ;;
well okay, you can go cheap here too. <@455797717763883009> ;;
but i usually spend more;;
And I'll steal ketchup and make icicles with the snow;;
Hahaahha;;
I would steal.mustard and pretend I pissed in the snow;;
ill give you ketchup ok <@455797717763883009>;;
I had a fresh comp sci degree graduate ask me what he needs to know to get a job, I told him to forget all the BS you learned in school because you will need to learn the right way to do it;;
Lmao;;
I bet he loved hearing that;;
Spicy ketchup üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è;;
he drank the rest of the night üòõ;;
Lol;;
Hahaha;;
<@275429891774742531> jobs told me the same thing lol;;
college is not about learning subjects its about learning how to live without your parents;;
lol yeah pretty much;;
just the experiences and friends I met there alone were worth it though;;
i still dont understand what college is... fuck this chat;;
That's for sure  <@416803598173995018>;;
google it <@207416847019016202> Im too lazy to explain;;
<@207416847019016202> best answer: Money PIT;;
lmao;;
<@207416847019016202> where you get STDs;;
im too lazy to google <@416803598173995018>;;
and alcohol poisoning;;
and stress;;
Or OD;;
lol <@207416847019016202> then we are in a standstill;;
lol yeah <@455797717763883009> especially now in America;;
Wow really? I thought it's better now;;
yeah, i will never know about college <@416803598173995018>;;
its sooooo bad now <@455797717763883009> heroin and opiates so huge now. Tons of people die here every year from OD's;;
its ok <@207416847019016202> its not really important so;;
Damn;;
yeah, no one in dubai asked about college <@416803598173995018>;;
Lost 5 friends in the past 5 years because of it;;
so opiates have replace Adderall?;;
Fuck that's terrible  <@416803598173995018>;;
<@275429891774742531> adderall is still big but not nearly as deadly as opiates;;
I sometimes eat a lot of gummy bears and have stomachaches;;
heroin and opiates are so crazy cheap so people buy a ton and do too much or get addicted immediately;;
lol <@455797717763883009> especially the sugar free ones;;
Someday you might find a panda with a pack of gummy bears on the floor;;
a 6 foot one?;;
"I have seen that but they were ""special"" gummy bears";;
Haribo is my favourite;;
oh yeah those are damn good;;
I havent had a gummy bear in years;;
A 6 foot panda OD on Haribo;;
if you will decide to OD on haribo, please stream it <@455797717763883009>;;
yeah good idea <@207416847019016202>;;
Now that you reminded me I'm gonna have to buy it to Como for the weekend lol;;
PandaPlays - Gummy Bear Death;;
what a shitty way to die lol I feel like that would be painful;;
funny to watch though;;
oh yeah definitely lol;;
how far is como from milan? <@455797717763883009>;;
40 mins by train;;
35-40 mins;;
fuck, its how much i need to go on train from home to work, and i live and work almost in downtown;;
oh thats not bad at all;;
Russia is huge;;
damn <@207416847019016202> every day that long?;;
Yeah it's super close;;
i dont consider 1 hour trip to work is long;;
1 hour you can goto Turin. From Milan lol;;
1 hour by train is not long, by car that is a long time;;
i mean like, from my door to office door;;
And meet Christiano Ronaldo;;
34 minutes on train;;
ohh ok but you have to walk a bit too, right?;;
oh ok;;
i live and work veeery close to train, but still, you know, 5 minutes there, 10 here, and whole trip is almost an hour;;
lol <@455797717763883009> Ronaldo;;
<@207416847019016202> yeah thats not too bad for a commute;;
haha i need to google commute;;
my gf explained it to me;;
but i forgot;;
Your Gf seems smart  <@207416847019016202>;;
Also  <@207416847019016202> I want a refund, I subbed to you and no streams <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
when you will come to moscow, i will buy you a tampon <@455797717763883009>;;
lmao;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> üí¶;;
to be fair <@455797717763883009>, <@207416847019016202> did say he was going on vacation before he left;;
Haha I was just kidding lol;;
lol I know just messing around;;
üòÇ;;
thats why I waited to sub to his channel;;
I want that emote lol;;
i will spend your money with care <@455797717763883009>;;
Buy 5 meals at McDonald's;;
lol breakfast meals;;
omg, i ate Wendys yesterday;;
i love it so much;;
didnt try it for 5 years, because they shut down in russia;;
Wendy's was my cheap breakfast option in Tokyo lol;;
And that's the only Wendy's I've had in my life;;
I love the junior bacon cheeseburger at wendys lol;;
and that chocolate ice cream thing they have;;
when I went to Pars I was so surprised how busy the fast food places were there;;
I thought fast food was only an american thing;;
i love that burger that called daves i think;;
oh yeah I know that one <@207416847019016202>;;
what do you mean only american? you didnt know they has restaurants all over the world? or you thought they has, but no one likes it?;;
by they i mean every huge fast food chain;;
Yeah I knew they were in other places but I didnt know they were that popular;;
they wouldnt be in other places if they wasnt popular there;;
its their thing - to have a lot of customers;;
lol yeah true, well now I know;;
i think thats why wendys closed in russia;;
not popular;;
?;;
probably;;
so is it just mcdonalds there?;;
they had 8 places in moscow, when others had like up to 100;;
yeah tough to stay in business then;;
mcdonalds, kfc, burger king, subway;;
ahh ok;;
i love kfc and mcdonalds morning menu, but fuck, daves burger is fantastic...;;
thats like starbucks here. There is one on every other block lol;;
as far as big fast food chains, wendys is my favorite I think;;
Dairy queen too but I doubt they have those in Russia;;
we have a lot of starbucks too, i just dont consider them fastood imo;;
never heard of Dairy queen;;
oh yeah, no starbucks isnt fast food. Its just a coffee shop to me;;
dairy queen does a lot of ice cream but they have cheeseburgers and stuff too. I think they are the best fast food cheeseburgers;;
<@488734758847905803> I‚Äôd love to be interviewed. I‚Äôll have my lawyers hash out a contract.;;
<@537319907541516311> can I be your lawyer?;;
Ill try my hardest, I swear;;
"want to clarify, when i speak about ""here"", or ""we"" i mostly mean moscow, st petersburg and other 10-15 relatively big cities in western part of russia (or a lot of small ones, but they need to be in west too).";;
because eastern half of russia (where i used to live most of my life) is pretty much dead in terms of big food franchises. <@416803598173995018>;;
Yeah I figured thats what you meant <@207416847019016202>;;
you cant be his lawyer <@416803598173995018> ;;
because i am;;
and i want to say this interview thing seems shady;;
I object!;;
I have experience in law though;;
but you are more intimidating;;
so ok that makes sense;;
experience doesnt count here;;
only intimidation?;;
nothing counts;;
only me;;
hahahaha of course;;
it all makes sense now;;
ill be his financial advisor;;
sound good? <@537319907541516311>;;
I think for the interview, <@488734758847905803> should pay you at least 50,000 pounds;;
I dont have the symbol on my computer for that lol;;
Im #3 now! I beat out <@348165887347523594> YESSSSSSS;;
wow;;
<@416803598173995018> you can most certainly be my lawyer. Just promise to make sure <@488734758847905803> doesn‚Äôt ask me about the time I had a threesome with a melon and a banana. That was one smoothie you definitively don‚Äôt want to drink!;;
i think its greatest thing that happened or will happen to you this year <@416803598173995018>;;

Metro is so good;;
I played  both 2033 and last light redux back to back in december...a real blast;;
Tonight, I'll try to finish Wolfenstein 2 once for all;;
Then, I'm going back to RDR2 until I finish it. I feel a bit pulled off learning the controls again but I seriously need to finish this game. And I'm not going to restart the whole thing. I left it when I was at about 50%;;
Rdr2 is sooo good;;
I need to play Halo too;;

Wassup chat;;
Good job <@!345984543246909442>, your dongle just grew to 9!;;
Nice. Weekend will be tough but I can play in a few hours for sure;;
sup <@345984543246909442>;;
Hey <@345984543246909442>;;
How ya doin;;
Fine here budd, how are you?;;
I‚Äôm good here with my son & setting up currency & mini games for my stream finally;;
Niioooce;;
Yea;;
Where can I put my twitter stuff at bro;;
"I think in the  ""links for any social media""";;
Yep exactly. Do you have it on your profile too? <@345984543246909442>;;
My twitter ? <@416803598173995018>;;
On discord I mean;;
Yeah;;
Yea;;
Ok cool;;
You may add it on your twitch now live announcements posts;;
Just dropped you a follow on both <@345984543246909442>;;
To make sure people see it...just add it at the end of your twitch live announcements too <@345984543246909442>;;
What you mean bro <@348165887347523594>;;
"When you announce your live streams on the  ""twitch-now-live"" channel, just add your twitter channel inside those posts";;
Ook;;
Thnx bro;;
No problem üòâ;;
I meant your twitter channel ( I corrected it) <@345984543246909442>;;
<@345984543246909442> you can put your twitter in <#509014397109141506> haha;;
Thanks for the follows back <@345984543246909442>;;
I just noticed that I'm subbed to way too many streamers...At the end of this month I'm gonna have a vote between me my dongle and two nuts to know who I'm keeping and who I will drop. I'll do this every month cause my wallet is hurting and  there are streamers that deserve my support more than others. Some I have subbed to haven't been streaming much for about 2 months.;;
I‚Äôm hoping to get a cam soon <@348165887347523594> so you can switch a sub to me! Lol;;
No need for the cam really bro....I don't really care for it...well it depends...but you  don't really need one that bad. You're consistent that's what counts. I wanted to sub to you but yesterday I saw all these paypall invoices popping like popcorns on my mail box and I was like damn boy. I need to unsub quick so I can avoid bankruptcy lol;;
I don't like un subbing but if I want to support those I watch right now, like you and others, I need to drain all those subscriptions I already have on my paypall account. It's getting out of hands;;
yeah, no one's made of money;;
plus, just watching is also a great way to support;;
watching, chatting;;
dongle-holding;;
I‚Äôm working on getting a webcam also;;
dont you have one <@345984543246909442> ?;;
Nooo I‚Äôm using the laptop webcam;;
ah true;;
Yea;;
Im working on getting a webcam new headphones & a gaming chair;;
nice;;
This weekend I should be all up for some Apex <@488734758847905803> and <@416803598173995018>;;
And on pc too <@526319824704634881> üòâ;;
niiiiiiiiiice;;
finally;;
I hope <@207416847019016202> will soon be ready for dead space 3 coop, if he ever finishes the second one üòÖ;;
Yeah boooiiiii <@488734758847905803>;;
<@207416847019016202> never finishes;;
lol;;
Lol yeah I feel ya <@348165887347523594>  I‚Äôm opposite, I don‚Äôt sub enough to people lol. Gotta get better at that;;
it's tough at times <@416803598173995018>;;
Well, it's not like we have a choice...it's about money;;
subbing for me is 20 bucks;;
for a tier 1 sub;;
what?;;
so I only sub to people with twitch prime;;
yeah, because of the conversion;;
like, for me to sub to someone;;
20 us dollars?;;
I need to spend 20 bucks;;
nah;;
20 BRL;;
ok ok;;
<@348165887347523594> I would suggest you to have a cap on the amount and just rotate your subs;;
Also good evening;;
I woke up at 1am to have my dinner lol;;
<@488734758847905803> what's Helldivers?;;
This is what I'm planning on doing...rotate my subs monthly <@455797717763883009>;;
it's like gauntlet <@455797717763883009> have you played it?;;
lemme get a clip;;
I'm just hearing about it;;
cause gauntlet is another game we can play in  4 people;;
How much is 20 brl in euros, or us dollars <@488734758847905803> ?;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM8GrqWgcxI;;
Hearing gauntlet for the first time too <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6cNMGaakXs;;
omg <@455797717763883009> gauntlet legends for N64 is soooo good;;
20 BRL in euros is like.... 4 euros;;
but;;
you can do A LOT more with euros than  with brls;;
That is the kind of game I would love to play coop <@488734758847905803> .... This is my fav type of multiplayer for raw fun;;
so, like, minimum wage here is 1000 bucks.;;
and a ps4 costs 1200 bucks;;
yeah man, get it and let's  play <@348165887347523594> !;;
so, like, if you go out to lunch at very cheap restaurant;;
lunch will cost 25 bucks;;
Oh sweet. Looks fun;;
Ok, the rate is almost the same here...about 5 euros for cheap chinese food;;
helldivers is super hard <@455797717763883009>;;
and theres even friendly fire;;
It's around 4.70 euros for a sub for me...and I'm subbed to about 10 people or more...So it's getting way too expensive;;
gauntlet was free with ps plus a few years ago iirc;;
yeah, damn;;
that's crazy;;
Damn I'll just end up killing you lol;;
hahahah;;
I'll check out Helldivers;;
Hw much is Helldivers?;;
Let's finish A Way Out first;;
yeah let's;;
I dunno kelly, I think i t was fairly cheap;;
I still have that region block bs making it hard for me to buy anything on the ps store;;
20$;;
You have it already <@488734758847905803> ?;;
I do <@348165887347523594>;;
Ps or xb?;;
20 dollars?;;
playsttaion;;
20$ on steam;;
40$ on PS;;
Lol;;
holy schnitzel;;
https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA02945_00-HELLDIVERSSCEA00;;
https://www.amazon.com/Helldivers-Super-Earth-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZRBQISA;;
15$ on Amazon;;
So how much did you get it for <@488734758847905803> ?;;
Yeeeey <@348165887347523594>!;;
Hey, <@526319824704634881> , what's up...how is your saturday going so far?;;

Good.. wanted to go back to sleep earlier but couldn't so I took a cold shower.. now just going to have bfast and watch some streams..;;
How are you <@348165887347523594> ? Back home?;;
Yes back home...it's a bit hectic cause I have lot of work to catch back and my Microsoft Surface pro stayed at the security check point in Florida. My haunt got it back for me yesterday, and now I'm trying to get the flight company to send it back here;;
Shit..that sucks..;;
But other than that I'm fine;;
Yes it sucks;;
But I feel a lot better knowing that it's somewhere safe;;
I was extremely angry about that yesterday though...but things will get sorted out...as usual üòâ;;
I would too if it was me...;;
Yeah..it will..;;
Okay brb.. going to find food..;;
Enjoy your meal;;

Oh yeah?;;
I just couldn't find the place to progress, everywhere it seemed like I needed an ability;;
Hollow knight or something else?;;
Hollow Knight;;
I need to try and start a new run at some time. I really liked it;;
It‚Äôs damn fun I got the standard ending today and I hope to get the hidden endings soon;;

I thought so I do wish that arma 3 would download faster though;;
Going for some standard ARMA or RP?;;
The altissa mod where you play as rebels against the Russians;;

hey dude! cool, why did you change it?;;
https://goo.gl/images/MSkCyy - <@416803598173995018> this is what awaits me;;
I changed it to match my psn plus what I had was kinda stupid lol;;
Ahh nice. We gotta go to some class today so we can get married in the church yayyyyyy, not lol. I should be on apex later though;;
Damn looks intense <@488734758847905803>  hey <@448648678224429068> how‚Äôs it going?;;

careful now, dont go too crazy;;
Good how about you <@416803598173995018>;;
<@488734758847905803> I went to play apex with Armageddon one day and he kicked me because he didn‚Äôt know it was me because of my twitch name so now people will know lol;;
<@488734758847905803> don‚Äôt go wild either. Yeah today is gonna be awful haha. <@448648678224429068> not doing  bad. Got a stupid day today but hopefully I can play some apex later;;
Yeah I‚Äôm at work right now but then I get to go home and play in a cod tourney lol;;
Oh nice man. Shit I haven‚Äôt played cod probably since the last time you and I played together lol;;
<@448648678224429068> just gotta message him before hand too. lol;;
Lol yeah the clan I‚Äôm in we do tourneys every month;;
lmao <@448648678224429068> that sucks;;
thats cool man <@448648678224429068>;;
<@311684705810513921> I was chatting with him in his stream when I joined him he still didn‚Äôt know it was me lol;;
Oh, RIP;;
lol;;
Yeah it was funny;;
I'm just waiting for PSN to allow name changes;;
It‚Äôs coming with the next 2 or 3 months from what I heard but they also say if you change your psn name that you will lose your digital downloads;;
damn thats stupid. Luckily my name is the same everywhere;;
yeah <@311684705810513921> me too;;
I hope that's not true about the downloads;;
yeah that would be fucked if it was true;;
I think arma was the one I was talking to that‚Äôs what he said;;
Damn thats so messed up by sony;;
what?;;
i doubt that's true.;;
if it is, it's the dumbest thing ever;;
It‚Äôs just another way for Sony to make money though;;
guess we will see but Im not changing so doesnt bother me lol;;
yeah I could see that being the reason <@448648678224429068>;;
I don‚Äôt know any other name to change so I‚Äôm stuck;;
not really <@448648678224429068> because who is going to d o that?;;
most  of my games are digital;;
I didnt find anything about that on google;;
All of my games are digital except for black ops 3;;
I think he's probably just saying something he heard;;
yeah hopefully;;
Yeah, nothing really has been confirmed on it either;;
"because Sony just dropped that ""it's coming"" but that's it";;
im #3 again bitchesssssss lol;;
yeah no date in sight from a quick google search;;
oooooooooooooo shit;;
true <@311684705810513921>;;
Xbox allows you to, but you gotta pay like 5 bucks;;
Fuck its raining here and I just want to stay home all day and play apex lol;;
I'd gladly pay 5 dollars to change my PSN;;
same;;
Sony said the first name change is free but after that you have to pay;;
lol yeah <@488734758847905803> you do need to change yours;;
<@448648678224429068> that makes sense and seems fair;;
yeap;;
acidowl7 - so edgy;;
much wow;;
It would be great if you were smart enough to come up with names lol;;
hahaah;;
<@488734758847905803> hardcore dude.....hardcore;;
I mean, mine isn't bad;;
Good job <@!311684705810513921>, your dongle just grew to 7!;;
but I'd just want it to match my twitch;;
ATalking-Muffin is a good name üòÑ;;
mine is bad and I feel bad;;
it's better than mine for sure;;
I almost made my twitch name acidowl;;
my lawd;;
yeah luckily all my stuff matches my name here and everywhere else. I could change it but I have no clue what I would even change it to. No pun intended with the change lol;;
Yeah that‚Äôs why I changed my twitch name because I have had my psn since the ps3 came out so better stick with it;;
<@488734758847905803> to be fair you could have had trippy owl emotes lol. thats kinda cool;;
lmao <@416803598173995018>;;
true <@448648678224429068>;;
ahhaha yeah, but the name isnt as classy / doesnt stand out as much imo;;
And I finally have most of my friends that I play with saying it right so can‚Äôt change it on them;;
TRUE;;
that isdef important;;
Lol yeah true <@488734758847905803>;;
<@488734758847905803> can I send you my laptop ps4 and capture card and you set it all up for my stream lmao I‚Äôm lost trying to;;
haha - yeah man, you'll just wait about 3 months to get it back cause international shipping;;

<@448648678224429068> same one I have. What's the issue?;;
My laptop won‚Äôt recognize it for some reason and it has the right USB ports and everything;;
<@311684705810513921>;;
did you download the software and all that?;;
Yeah for some reason when I plug my card in it lights up but then shuts right back off;;
Hmm;;
not sure with that one;;
could be a defect in the card;;
Don‚Äôt tell me that lol I just bought it and I had to wait 2 months for them to ship it to me;;
oof;;
really not sure why it would do that otherwise;;
Yeah idk I will work on it a little more after work and see but I gotta run and do some stuff in the barn will be back shortly;;
I‚Äôm back  @everyone;;

Sorry to hear that. And True. I pretty much raised my nephews from age 11 to almost age 24 so I adulted early üòÇ;;

It is still worth seeing, to me this movie aged well. Or maybe I'm getting too old;;
"i have no ""rules"" about not watching old movies, so i may watch them, just didnt thought about it";;
Sure. Yeah, I recommend it.  Very fun and fast paced movie.;;
Evening fellas üêº;;
<@207416847019016202> are you wearing a robe?;;
"And going ""yalla habibi""";;
actually not much people here wearing robes;;
according to guide, only 10% here is local arab people;;

That could easily be true. Lot of my university friends and juniors are working there;;
Must be filled with expats;;

üëÄ;;
Good job <@!526319824704634881>, your dongle just grew to 10!;;
Hello guys...been playing games almost all day long üòÖ;;
I'm still enjoying Anthem despite all the issues....wtf is wrong with me? I can't get tired of it, even though I acknowledge it's a huge disappointment. I feel almost ashamed to admit this;;
Nah you‚Äôre good ain‚Äôt nothing wrong with enjoying a game u like;;
<@348165887347523594> Cool that ur enjoying Anthem. I enjoy it for the most part. The load screens could improve but overall it‚Äôs a fun game.;;
<@348165887347523594> I love Anthem, feel it‚Äôs getting a lot of hate because of the fact it‚Äôs related to EA. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it has bugs, but it‚Äôs so much fun!;;
I agree. EA and of course you have a lot of fans out there that want another  Dragon Age or ME so there is hate come from that. It‚Äôs a shame since there is a lot to like from Anthem;;
Completely agree <@456226577798135808>. I never understood fans who hate on a game because they want another. I feel if Anthem is successful I‚Äôm more likely to see another ME or Dragon Age?;;
Plus I want more anthem anyway? I love biowares story telling and game play in all their franchises?;;
Wait is franchises a word? ü§î;;
Lol. It can be. Yes it‚Äôs def a word.;;
I love the flying in the game and the different builds;;
LOL I just looked at the word and was like, I‚Äôm not sure üòÇ;;
And same! The flying and customisation is awesome!;;
I‚Äôm loving seeing everyone‚Äôs Javelins;;
I started with a Storm and now I‚Äôm playing an Interceptor.;;
Hard Javelin to play;;
In ur face and def more hack and slash;;
Nice! I started with Storm too! Absolutely love it.;;
But fun;;
Storm can blow some shit up;;
And yeah the Interceptor does look hard to play? But might have to give it a go?;;
It can! I love the elemental side to it!;;
I love the idea behind a primer and detonator for combos;;
Same!;;
What system are u playing on?;;
Xbox. How about you?;;
I‚Äôm a console player;;
Same;;
Nice! If you‚Äôre happy to share, what‚Äôs your gamer tag? I‚Äôll add you?;;
Sure. It‚Äôs ThaSwampDonk;;
Awesome will add you now. I‚Äôm DelicateAlarm44 (old gamer tag that I cant be bothered changing üòÑ);;
If u catch me on some time. holler at me and we can go blow some stuff up in Anthem.;;
Added you to my friends list.;;
Just added you. And will do! üòä;;
Hey guys, what's up?;;
Just got home from the festivities haha;;
We got caught in the rain in the middle of nowhere and walked for like 2 hours;;
But not normal rain;;
It was like torrential rain lmao;;
I had to borrow my female friend's clothes to come home hahaahah;;
Also, about anthem, the main thing for me was the story not being so good;;
<@488734758847905803> hello brother;;
Hey <@448648678224429068> ! What up dude?;;
Not much partying with my brothers;;
I feel weird calling you that lok;;
Lol*;;
Oh nice;;
Lol it‚Äôs all good;;
I played in my first tourney today on black ops 4 and won the entire thing;;
Oooooh shit you won?;;
Congrats dude!;;
It was awesome;;
Congrats on the win <@448648678224429068>! That‚Äôs awesome!;;
And hope you guys are home and comfy in dry clothes now <@488734758847905803>?;;
Yep <@456226577798135808>  and <@525710142294196254> , I'm really enjoying it. I don't really know why, but fuck it...So far so good...The technical issues have been gone for a while now. And maybe it's the way that I have been playing  it, but I'm actually enjoying the story.  There is still so much space to be discovered in the fort though. Maybe there is more to it;;
I feel there is more to come given the space we still haven‚Äôt seen yet? And I‚Äôm excited for what they might release?;;
Thanks <@525710142294196254>;;
The loading screens are not even an issue now....It's so much quicker than when I left 2 weeks ago. It was my main issue with the game. Right now, it's not. It's very quick and I haven't even move it back to my new ssd.;;
<@525710142294196254> I totally agree...so much space to discover. I'm just going to stuck to it for now. I have played way more than 20 hours so far, and I haven't finished the main mission yet. So my final impression is, I would not've regret it if I had spent the full price. Final world. Read this <@278571432588345345> , I'm no longer conflicted about it.;;
üëÄ;;
Sup <@278571432588345345>;;
Sup my brother <@207416847019016202>;;
Seen you lurking;;
hey <@348165887347523594>;;
Can't wait t watch your streams bro;;
haha i cant wait stream;;
I should've started now...But some client rented my beach house at the last moment;;
Those limitations are getting to me;;
The system I'm using right now doesn't seem stable enough to stream.;;
Good enough to watch streams...play co-op or multiplayer..but not twitch streams;;
Thing is, fans want not just another me or da, they want it to be good game with huge accent on story, and of course without any kind of in game monetization. Problem is, the more success has online looter shooter with monetization, the less chances they will invest in story driven single game.  <@525710142294196254>;;
My question is, what ME2 , 1 or 2 had that Andromeda didn't have? It's been a long time...But Andromeda was absolutely what I was expecting and more. I did not experience the bad faces and animations. I got the game about 6 months after it came out and it was all patched and I really loved it. Still now most people say it  was a shit game. So what did ME trilogy had more than Andromeda. Just asking.;;
Me 1 and 3 (and even 3) in comparison to andromeda had very engaging story, and characters, and characters quests. You can call it tastes, but andromeda story and characters were uninteresting.;;
Nothing fascinated you;;
And I don't care about face animation;;
I was interested...but it was just me and  few I guess. I loved the story. I loved the dialogues and especially the gameplay. But after Andromeda, I knew I had shit taste about video games lol;;
I admit that andromeda combat was good, but given bioware games history, its not that bioware fans want from their games;;
Including me;;
But I clearly understand that for many years already bioware is totally another company, with not the same people, and theres no point to expect from them games as good as old ones;;
Totally different company I meant;;
See, I didn't like RDR2 that much....I acknowledge that it is a masterpiece but it bored the hell out of me as a game. The controls were shit to me. The story was great great great...but as a game...I hated it as the controls felt off the entire time. A real shore. I hate shores in games as I spend most of my time fixing shit and I hate when games make me work more than my actual work.;;
But in the other hand, I thought Andromeda was fast paced and fun;;
I understand that not everyone loves everyone, but a lot people lover both rdr  games, And now imagine that next rockstar game will be shooter without story;;
Thing is that fan base of developer is created around certain kind of game;;
And I totally understand when that fan base get something totally different;;
I'm not sure I understand;;
I'm no fan of games without stories though;;
I mean, there s a reason why bioware fan base is big;;
It's because of games they made;;
Sure;;
They have gone down.;;
I don't play games without stories...like never. My first one is Apex...because it's fun playing with friends;;
And that games had similar good things, like story and characters. And it's understandable that that huge fan base expect the same kind of games;;
And of course they (including me) hate the fact that company trying to do looter shooter almost without story;;
<@348165887347523594> I agree with you in RDR2. I feel exactly the same about it;;
Hey <@416803598173995018>;;
Really, I 'm all about story, but RDR2 felt like I was brining more work at home;;
It felt like home work;;
Hey man, how you doing?;;
Lol yeah I felt the same way;;
I'm very fine bro...But not sleepy;;
I miss games like Halo...great story, awesome gameplay...and pure and immediate fun;;
Yeah man. Halo is one of my all time favorites. Lots of memories with that game;;
Me too;;
Any one here knows about the legal weed business? I'm very interested in getting a dispensary . The land isn't an issue, but I need to give some numbers to my bank;;
It all depends on your state <@348165887347523594>;;
I was thinking that it may be more profitable than getting another beach house.;;
In Jamaica <@448648678224429068> .. It's legal now;;
I thought it has always been legal there lmao;;
lol;;
Seriously though;;
I'm talking about legal fields;;
I have land there, but I have no numbers for my bank;;
I couldn‚Äôt tell you about there because I don‚Äôt know about the taxes and all that stuff;;
Do you have knowledge about the U.S dispensaries? <@448648678224429068>;;
Some what;;
Well, If you can point me to some info, or more, I'd be greatful;;
Like I said, I need some numbers for my bank;;
For 1/8 ounce here it‚Äôs $40.00;;
And how much ounces a tree can bring?;;
Depending on the watts of the lighting 14 oz to 42 oz;;
Ok...well, I'll dm you tomorrow <@448648678224429068> . I really need to know more about all this;;
No problem will try to help the best I can;;
üòâ;;
It's either going to be this, or another beach house;;
You could buy me a beach house if you want ü§£;;
It's limited...seems that the few people that have dispensaries in Jamaica since it got legal last year are making a shit load of money. This is why I'm asking;;
O I bet you could make a shit load;;
The beach houses are alright. The two I have make a decent amount of money...but it's limited;;
Yeah. But I gotta head to bed gotta be at work in 4 hours;;
Good night lol;;
You to;;
<@348165887347523594> I‚Äôm an expert in consuming weed lol but not owning a weed business;;
I've been a huge consumer <@416803598173995018> brother;;
Lmao I knew I liked you! It‚Äôs legal here in ca and I‚Äôve got my medical license. It‚Äôs a booming business here;;
Dm you right now;;
Mornin dongles and donglettes;;
<a:hotcoffee:537944974160035861>;;
Donglettes? <:jonnyp3Excuse:549095329601945601>;;
I knew what you meant.lol.;;
Morning. What are we playing today? Tonight is virtual table top night with my brother and a friend. Not sure what we will play yet. Last two nights just way too tired to play anything. Plus I've  been hanging out a lot with friends and the family.;;
It sounds really nice Barabbas;;
üëÄ;;
Lmao morning guys;;

Morning <@488734758847905803> and <@345984543246909442> üòä;;
Hey <@525710142294196254> !;;
Hey <@525710142294196254>;;
<@348165887347523594> lots of taxes you get hit with on that business. My understanding it can be an extremely hard business.;;
<@87241615671832576> how are you doing man. Hope ur doing well;;
hey <@456226577798135808>;;
I am doing well TheSwampDonkey#5398;;
 Just trying to keep up with everything in the house so the wife don't have to worry. She has MS and just had an Attak earlier this week, so she just have to concentrate on recovering;;
Sorry to hear that <@87241615671832576>. Hope it‚Äôs settling down for her?;;
that's rough <@87241615671832576> ;;
hope she feels better soon;;
<@87241615671832576> super dad and husband;;
you forgot friend haha;;
Don't know about all of that, but it does start to tear down on my energy level. I am currently at a high on motivation for streaming,  but due to exhaustion it would just be a sleep stream xD;;
And she is getting better, it's just the medication she have had the last 3 days have  made her very incapacitated or rather she wants to do a lot of stuff and I keep on putting her to bed,  so she's not going have any accidents due to lack of any coordination or passing out.;;
I can imagine how exhausting that can be <@87241615671832576>;;
<@488734758847905803> Morning.;;
what's up?;;
<@87241615671832576> Sorry to hear that man. Hope she feels better soon.;;
<@488734758847905803> Nothing much. Was playing some FC5 DLC. About to head out to my daughters cheer competition. All weekend thing so not much gaming for me this weekend.;;
<@87241615671832576> and if you ever need to talk, vent or a virtual shoulder to cry on, feel free to IM me. Here or on Twitter. Totally understand what your wife and you are going though!;;
Thank you :) Everything is fine, we just need to regain energy;;
üëç;;

Nice well I‚Äôm not sure how far home is but be safe;;
It‚Äôs a couple hours haha but thank you!;;
It‚Äôs snowing here and I hate it;;
Good job <@!448648678224429068>, your dongle just grew to 16!;;
I miss the snow;;
I like the snow and all just not when I have to drive home from work;;
We've barely had any and right now I am afraid we'll have an early summer again;;
Morning;;
Oh true <@448648678224429068>;;
Morning <@311684705810513921>;;
Morning <@311684705810513921>;;
Morning;;
How are you guys doing today?;;
I‚Äôm good;;
Wonderful ü§£;;
<@524820041976250368> morning;;
<@311684705810513921> morning;;
An hour left for work;;
Woo hoo;;
Then party time. Lol;;
Wish I could say that I‚Äôve been here in 7 and have gotten crap done;;
Probably play some video games;;
I‚Äôm gonna see what female I can make mad today haha;;
Whatcha going to play;;
<@448648678224429068> ha. Would not advise that. Lol;;
That‚Äôs a typical day in my life <@456226577798135808>;;
Same here. Or in general I seem to piss someone off;;
So what games is everyone enjoying lately.;;
Wouldn‚Äôt be who I am if I didn‚Äôt achieve it every day;;
I‚Äôve been playing apex mostly but jump between it and bo4;;
I tend to stay away from drama;;
Lol;;
How‚Äôre you? <@456226577798135808>;;
I‚Äôm good. How are u?;;
I‚Äôm good!;;
Have any of y‚Äôall jumped on the Division 2 open beta this weekend?;;
I did;;
If so, how are you liking it. I think this is the last day for it;;
I had fun with it;;
I think tomorrow is actually;;
Good. Glad to hear.;;
but mondays dont count do they?;;
haha;;
cause I think it's only till 12pm EST;;
but I might be wrong about that;;
Is it? Wasn‚Äôt sure when they would turn it off;;
Im pretty sure it was march 4th;;
I think it said the 4th;;
Ends: March 4 -1am PT/ 4am ET/ 9am UK/ 10am CET;;
I was wrong;;
Monday‚Äôs don‚Äôt count for me. I have to work. Haha;;
it is the 4th, but in the wee hours;;
Ya. Kind of what I figured.;;
Boo;;
I didn‚Äôt play the open. Played the Private.;;
Lots of good stuff and I feel it will be a solid game.;;
same;;
I probs won't get it now because monies;;
Ya. Bummer;;
But understand;;
Games can be expensive;;
That‚Äôs one of the reasons I was looking at building a pc. Cheaper games;;
As far as the division 2. I feel that even though I would play 2, I would still go back to one because of the environment.;;
Mix it up;;
no, I understand haha;;
I am just saving to get a PC since  mine is starting to act up;;
I found a build but with 32gb ram it‚Äôs around 1200;;
true. I need a portable pc, I'm looking at some NUC's;;
is 32gb ram necessary you think?;;
16 is almost enough for me, but more will never hurt you know;;
hurts my wallet lol;;
Agree;;
I can always add more too;;
Hurts the wallet is correct.;;
Prob start with 16 and upgrade if necessary;;
yeah that's what I'll prob do;;
now I have to find a damn motherboard that has a thunderbolt port;;
or is port not the right word?;;
socket?;;
*I'm still alive*;;
Hello peeps;;
Ahh thunderbolt btw?;;
'This was a triumph';;
hey <@!498246547838992414>;;
<@87241615671832576> - yeah, so I can get a gpu in hte future;;
focusing more on performance for now;;
But most GPUs todayrun on PSI;;
PSI....;;
fok all this lingo hahaha;;
It feels so overwhelming sometimes;;
Indeed, I went for full AMD aside could have a top tier PC for half the price and I've not had any issues;;
AMD processors?;;
processor&;;
***;;
Remember new AMD CPUs will be out probably in May/Jun;;
Good job <@!275429891774742531>, your dongle just grew to 2!;;
looks to be a big jump;;
ah true;;
I will be going to the states in May;;
The Ryzen 5 I use now gas 6 cores, and pretty much don't care about me streaming and doing other things on the side;;
leak recently shows the 3600 will have 8 cores and the 3700 will have 12;;
and the monster 3800/3850? will have 16;;
insane, madness I tell you;;
Whoa;;
I def don't need that for now hahaha;;
<@87241615671832576> what‚Äôs urs setup?;;
I‚Äôve been looking at a Ryzen 5 2600x with an MSI GeForce RTX2060 and an AS Rock ATX motherboard.;;
I helped a buddy build a similar system but we used the new 1660ti, he is pretty happy with it;;
What‚Äôs the biggest difference between the 1660ti and the 2060?;;
Good job <@456226577798135808>, your dongle just grew to 7!;;
about $70, a little better performance and RTX that it cant utilize;;
Interesting. Will look into the 1660ti;;
1660ti performance is on par with 1070;;
for $279;;
I currently have a Ryzen 5 1600 X, byt I cant Remember my GPU. It's The corresponding ti the Nvidia 1080ti;;
1080ti is a damn fine GPU;;
True, but overpriced conpares to what it does.;;
In my opinion though;;
I'd never force anyone to go against their own beliefs.;;
you cant get them anymore but I agree, I paid waaaaay to much;;
same with 2080ti now, insane prices;;
Yeahh people should stay away from the 2000 series till it's actually necessary to use;;
I don‚Äôt know a ton about PCs but read the 2060 is a pretty descent gpu;;
Maybe it‚Äôs a bit overkill. No clue;;
It is;;
a decent gpu that is;;
From what I've seen it's way overkill as most games are not really utilizing it properly,  but in 2-3 years it will be really good to have;;
I watched a YT vid on the 2060 compared to like the 1070 and 1080. It‚Äôs seemed to outperform them on framerate but no clue on anything else.;;
for 1080 gaming most any midrange GPU will be outstanding;;
Ok. So for future proof the 2060 would be a good one to get;;
start running into issue when going to 1440p;;
and 4k, open up that wallet üòõ;;
Yea. Stuff gets expensive.;;
Overall if I am spending the money on a cpu build, I want one that will last me 4-5 years and can handle pretty much anything I throw at it;;
same here <@456226577798135808>;;
at the very least 4 years;;
with the exceptional addition here or there;;
It's the best way to go. That's the same I do;;
like ssd or something;;
SSD are getting super cheap;;
about time;;
Yea. Was thinking. 500gb to 1tb for OS loading and maybe a game or 2 and then a 2-4tb Hdd for storage;;
As for a monitor, I have no clue.;;
that is what I recommend for people;;
It was recommended a 1080p 144hz one;;
yup that is the best price/pretty ratio;;
Yeah but what about a 4K monitor?;;
I suppose I could hook the pc up to a 4K tv if I wanted?;;
nope;;
Good job <@!275429891774742531>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
do not hook it up to your TV;;
Lol. Well shit;;
4K monitors are not cheap;;
it would not be a good time gaming, for video yes your fine but not gaming;;
and you need a vid card to run that monster 4k so its $$$$;;
the compromise is 1440p gaming and that is really where its at IMO;;
Gotcha;;
I went crazy with my monitor and bought ultrawide;;
but when I bought it my video card was only a 960 so I could not game until I upgraded;;
dont be me, be sensible;;
Thanks fellas, I just hit 50 twitch followers, I couldn't have done it without this community!!!;;
gratz <@!498246547838992414>;;

Nice <@207416847019016202> how many days left of vacation?;;
Oops no. It's another festival, when they clebrate Lord Shiva;;
Expensive setup seem to be working fine today;;

<@348165887347523594> got your surface back?;;
My family got it back for me. But the plane company won't send it back to me. They're asking 300 dollars to ship it. So, I told my aunt to keep until I go back there in about a month;;
"last couple of days we discovered for ourselves really ""real-lify"" district, you know, not only highways with skyscrapers (which i would love if it all was pedestrian-friendly), but real district suited for life, kinda looking like a moscow. and theres some boats that connects districts, so we will spend tomorrow also there, as we did today and yesterday <@416803598173995018>";;
Sounds really nice <@207416847019016202> I'm going on a work trip this Sunday to Wednesday in Chicago, looking forward to it since I have never been there before;;
Nice <@416803598173995018> , work trips are the shit. Nice opportunity to change air with minimal expenses;;
Yeah I shouldnt have to pay for hardly anything. This is actually the first business trip I have ever taken so Im really excited for it;;
Take some photos there in Chicago  <@416803598173995018>;;
I would be <@416803598173995018>;;
<@207416847019016202> I definitely will, not sure how much exploring I will get to do though. <@348165887347523594> yeah I didnt think they would send me, since I have been so busy with work here but they are getting someone to help cover my duties while I'm gone so thats cool;;
300$? Wtf. They could just send it through someone who's coming your side  <@348165887347523594>;;
<@455797717763883009> My aunt said the the lady she spoke to was just being an asshole.;;
The human factor is real;;
Yeah it is;;
How are all of you?  :);;
im good, how about you  landsby <@87241615671832576>;;
Good to hear  :) I am tired, but elsewise I am fine.;;
Morning everyone!üíú;;
how are you today? <@524820041976250368>;;
Morning;;
I‚Äôm good feel like I‚Äôve been hit by a bus thoüòÇ <@278571432588345345> how‚Äôre you?;;
lol;;
How‚Äôre you? <@87241615671832576>;;
been there;;
having a pretty good day so far;;
That‚Äôs good to hear! My whole body hurts I think it‚Äôs the way I sleptüòÇ;;
I am tired, but good <@524820041976250368> ;;
And I hope it'll subside fast :);;
how did you sleep? hahaha;;
I hope so! <@87241615671832576>;;
And <@278571432588345345> both times i woke up my body was twisted in different directions lol;;
Sounds weird;;
hahaha;;
I'm not that flexible;;
I usually wake up exactly the way I went to sleep;;
super boring sleeper;;
It's the same for me, but it also mean a part of my body hurts like hell at times, due to be sleeping in the same position for 8 hours;;
Not me lmao I‚Äôm more of a diagonal sleeper and this bed is just not big enough for me to sleep that way. And I‚Äôm not a flexible person eitherüòÇ also I could be feeling it from the 30 something block walk I did Saturday night as well;;
Haha;;
casual 30 block walk?;;
Haha more of a fast paced buzzed walk;;
Hopefully I don't move much when I sleep...there is always a bunch of things around me on my bed. Actually there is a couple books, two laptops I still need to finish working on. My huge headset, a bottle of skin lotion, my phone, my two pair of glasses, my ps4 controller, my xbox controller and ho, Halo master chief collection cover box...My keyboard and mouse....wow that's a whole lot of things. Kind of things that remind me that I may need to find me a girlfriend after all;;
That is a lot of things, I fell asleep with my laptop on my bed but I knew it was there so no matter what position I was in I didn‚Äôt get near it.  I‚Äôve only got a twin sized bed so I can‚Äôt have much laying on my bed lol;;
Wow you have a huge bad apparently  <@348165887347523594>;;
a bottle of skin lotion next to two laptops wtf <@348165887347523594>;;
and the masterchief collection..;;
get that shit outta there my dude;;
I've got a pretty big bed...I need to shake that habit off;;
lmao <@278571432588345345>;;
The bottle of lotion is at the other end of the bed hahaha;;
the two laptops are south west, the lotion is north east;;
and most of the hardware stays on the  west side of the bed me sleeping on the extreme east side of my bed. The west side use to be my ex girlfriend's spot. Now it's just work space lol;;
Do I look like a fokin compass to you <@348165887347523594> ???;;

Hope it‚Äôs a good one;;
Hello <@448648678224429068> , hope you're having a good evening or day;;
So far it‚Äôs been good but tomorrow will be better;;
It‚Äôs Bohemian rhapsody <@448648678224429068> so far so good;;
I haven‚Äôt seen it yet but would love to watch it;;
It‚Äôs my first time watching it lol;;
I don‚Äôt watch movies unless I got a date lol;;
Haha I rented it last night, but I don‚Äôt watch a lot of movies or tv;;
I need to move out of my state so I can go some where bigger with more choices in women lol;;
Haha what state you in?;;
Illinois the crappiest state ever;;
I‚Äôve been there for about a month and a half back in 2016;;
Where I live at there is only 300 people or less;;
wow lol;;
Ah okay lol;;
Yeah it‚Äôs very nice to live some where quiet but not a lot of choices around for decent women;;
True lol;;
But then to find one you have to drive and not worth it for it not to work;;
Been there done that but very true;;
Hmm my life is so lame lol;;
Nah one day you‚Äôll find the right one don‚Äôt rush it!;;
But you can‚Äôt sit around and wait for that day either because it‚Äôs not promised to you;;
True but it‚Äôs either meant to be or not meant to be;;
I don‚Äôt disagree at all but I‚Äôm not getting any younger lol;;
Being single has its perks but at the same time it sucksüòÇ;;
It don‚Äôt have no perks for me except for raising my kids on my own with no help;;
I‚Äôm sorry about that, I myself don‚Äôt have kids of my own. But I do know what it‚Äôs like raising kids. Now I‚Äôm focusing on myself and maybe one day I‚Äôll have kids whether they are my own or someone I‚Äôm with that has kids. I‚Äôve only ever been in 1 relationship lasted 6 months then I ended it;;
Do you mind me asking your age;;
24 I‚Äôll be 25 in May;;
Young one lol;;
Yes haha;;
I‚Äôm only 28 don‚Äôt let me kid you;;
Lol way I see it everyone is as young as they feel no matter how old they are people seem to think I look 17 üòÇ I don‚Äôt know why haha;;
Lol I get carded every time I get alcohol and I look older then I am;;
Haha I get carded a lot myself but depends on what store tho and if it‚Äôs a requirement no matter what the age is;;

I feel tired for no real reason;;
Lol;;
I've been like that all day long...I took a long nap this afternoon and the early part of the evening, and I still feel exhausted;;
Yeah I had a busy ass day at work and then a ton after work too;;
Got you;;

Yep, on the good side haha;;
cant say im addicted to travel, im usually feel great at home, but still, some vacation is good sometimes <@348165887347523594>;;
<@207416847019016202> Yep, I had not travel for so long though. It feels great changing air. And, difference is, I don't feel so great here...working at home is slowly getting to my nerves. It's a bit isolating.;;

Doing good, my head still feels like it's stuffed with cotton, it's so weird;;
How are you Kelly?;;
I'm fine, but expecting to be really tired today;;
I haven't slept yet. I may as well play more video games until I pass out;;
But why though....;;
Have you never had the urge to play till you pass out from exhaustion?;;
I recon, that's how future wars will be fought üòÉ;;
hahahaha;;
It's going to be perfect, we'll see the heroics of future wars on streaming services. It'll decide how borders are made and how we as a people will evolve;;
<@345380744375566338> I'm already up, I don't feel like going to bed right now....and I know that I'll be too tired to work today...well not any time soon...so I may as well burn the remaining fuel still running that body of mine before going to sleep.;;
<@87241615671832576> üòÇ it's weird...I can imagine this in a not so far future lol;;
Yeah, South Korea will be our supreme rulers;;

Morning  <@488734758847905803>;;
morning <@488734758847905803>;;
hey <@455797717763883009> and <@348165887347523594>;;
whats cracking?;;
Work as usual;;
laaaaaaaaaame;;
Planning to watch Captain Marvel this weekend;;
Lol;;
hm;;
I havent been a fan of superhero movies in a while;;
except batman;;
he's the dopest;;
I barely get to goto the cinemas here;;
So I go whenever there's a good English movie lol;;
About to dive balls deep to the deep in Wolfenstein 2. I'm finishing this game today;;
Used to watch at least 2 movies a week back home lol;;
or maybe some more anthem who knows;;
Ah Anthem;;
Those were good days;;
lol;;
Lat time I went to the movies was a long long long time ago <@455797717763883009>;;
haha true.;;
i dont go to the movies that much cause it's too  expensive;;
pay too much to watch a potentially crap movie;;
Haha;;
cinemas should start airing series and stuff;;
imagine watching breaking bad at the movies;;
I don't mind as long as I'm entertained for 2 hours;;
"and they could get you a ""season"" pass";;
so, 30 bucks to watch an entire season o f a s how at the movies;;
Or more like a Star Wars marathon;;
Or LoTR;;
yeah could be that too;;
if it's the first 6 star wars;;
Thing is I'm using a projector and have a pretty decent surround system. Going to the movies is just more a going out thing for me. Not really in order to  actually watch a movie;;
<@348165887347523594> more like FancyD;;
lol;;
I think the last time I went I watched Black Panther  with a friend;;
"I remember him saying ""damn Kelly, look at all these couples....Sucks to be us""";;
I gently asked him to stfu;;
Lmao;;
lmao  <@455797717763883009>;;
made me think of a dongle in a suit or something;;
all  spiffed up;;
pomade in the pubes;;
lmao <@348165887347523594> - gently asked to stfu;;
"Then I apologized....I wish I could say ""excuse my French""";;
hahaah;;

Lol yeah he was on my stream the other day. Got his first kill and it was hilarious;;
Hey, I actually came back to post about that <@207416847019016202>;;

yeah, all other messages will be deleted by bot;;

discord deaddddd today;;
Hahaha;;
My book isn't gonna write itself;;
stupid book;;
yeah stupid book. Getting in the way of discord and gaming;;
lets cancel book;;
<@488734758847905803> hey <@207416847019016202> said to cancel so you have to do what he says;;
im pretty sure he already did;;
Good. Now let's all quit our jobs and just play video games and hope we can make money doing it;;
i already play some games on my job, so its your turn;;
lol I wish I could;;
I just have work laptop, cant put anything on it though;;
i play tes legends on work laptop;;
Nice. They set it up so you have to have admin password whenever you put anything on the laptop so I cant put anything on here without them knowing;;
yeah i know, its always the thing with non-it personnel;;
one of perks being in IT - even its huge company with a lot of divisions and strict rules, still you have admin rights if youre in IT;;
oh yeah thats nice. Even if I could put games on here, I dont have enough time at work to play anything for more than a few minutes anyways so;;
I can get away with discord and watching streams once in awhile but that's really it;;
Enjoy the lack of power <@416803598173995018>;;
Keeps you in check;;
And lowers responsibilities...cause responsibilities suck;;
haha kelly is right;;
"some times, if you dont have access to something, when BIG FUCK UP HAPPENED, youre like ""okay, it definitely wasnt me who did it, because i didnt have access""";;
"and if you had, youre like ""fuck, what if that was me""";;
So true hahahaha;;
This is what I hate....being questioned cause I could've done it lol;;
The stakes are high whenever there is a fuck up;;
"well i dont get questioned, and if i fucked up, i will tell it instantly, but it still will suck, because you know, i kinda want to keep my ""not screwing up big time"" reputation";;
Yep, I tried that for a long time...but unfortunately, it happens at a certain point;;
inside of our company we have very non toxic relations (except toxic me), so if any fuck up happened, we think how to get it right, and not about whom should we kill;;
Sometimes it's not even you, it's just you putting your trust on someone that has put his trust on someone that has put his trust on someone....See what I mean here?;;
so when somebody fuck up its no problem;;
i see, but in my company it will be clear who exactly fucked up;;
so wrong person will not be blamed;;
Cool;;
especially if that person me;;
lol;;
fuck you, its not me kinda universal answer;;
lmao;;
I can't really do this haha....I work with companies though, not really for them. Well we could argue that my clients are my bosses actually;;
yeah i understand that;;
in my case, all relations outside of our company, can be huge mess too;;
because its other companies and you cant control them;;
Exactly;;
but inside our small 20 people company we got nothing shitty going on;;
we can be mean to each other, but nobody stands in the way of doing your job, which happens a lot in big companies;;
Yeah, 15 to 25 is fine. Most the companies I still work for are about this amount of employees. It maintainable;;
My main issue right now are the companies not willing to spend the money to get things done smoothly ...And I'm also having a hard time getting paid.;;
actually even up to 100 people is fine, especially if its purely IT company. but if its retail company (and all our clients are retail), it ususally has some complicated structure, with a lot of divisions, and different people, so it all really hard in communication;;
Yep;;
@everyone help! Streamlabs won't go live when I press it!!;;
what does it saying?;;
It just doesn't change to live when I press it;;
reboot your whole system;;
Will try FFS!;;

am slowly booting;;
gonna watch something for half an hour then continue the saga that is writing;;
That‚Äôs good! And Haha I got woke up at 5:30am I‚Äôm still a bit tired üòÇ;;
haha;;
I  can imagine;;
what woke you?;;
The technician haha I was at my second sleep study they boot you out the door between 5 and 6am;;
oh lol;;
feelzbad;;
Lol it‚Äôs all good definitely could breathe better last night didn‚Äôt sleep better cause I was in pain which I‚Äôm sure they probably got that on video üòÇ;;
is it weird knowing people are watching you sleep?;;
Eh somewhat I usually forget they are recording my every move;;
lol;;
I didn't sleep at all, so I just napped for an hour;;
lolz;;
that blows;;
has anyone heard of the game that's coming out called Outward?;;
it's by deep silver;;
looks kinda cool;;
Check out @XboxGamePass‚Äôs Tweet: https://twitter.com/XboxGamePass/status/1103292900471906305?s=09;;
<@488734758847905803> just checked Outward;;
The RPG elements look great;;
holy shit just cause 4 just came out I think no?;;
dont they <@455797717763883009> ?;;
could be a really cool co-op game;;
Yeah, but it didn't seem like a coop game though;;
Yeah JC was super recent;;
it is though, i saw that you can even play local co-op in the ps store;;
Morning all!;;
that's cool <@488734758847905803>;;
yo <@416803598173995018> !!;;
yeah <@455797717763883009> excited for it haha;;
Wud upppppppp?;;
yayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa;;
not much;;
just writing and procrastinating;;
YAYA ready for skydaze interview? lol;;
hells yayaya;;
I dont think the world is ready though;;
I'm going to try and tune in, work just put me in charge of a second account so today might be a little crazy but I should have time to watch;;
cool, hope you do!;;
if anything, you can watch the vod;;
I should be able to, really wanna watch his craziness lol;;
Work basically told me by the end of this year, they want me to move up to district manager. I am stuck about what to do lol;;
oh shit;;
future decisions;;
makes me nervous;;
lol for real. I think I wouldn't mind the job and the money would be absolutely amazing. So do I stick with this place or keep trying for an esports/video game job? Which is unknown and wouldn't pay as well lol;;
Fuck;;
it all comes down t o what money can or can't buy;;
is the joy you'd feel worth having l ess money?;;
would yuo work even more hours than you do now and have less time for the things y ou like?;;
money can't buy time sometimes;;
Money can buy you more games;;
Id work wayyyy more hours with a game company lol;;
And collector editions;;
I'd pretty much keep a similar schedule to what I have now, which lets me do a lot in my personal life. Also this company has unlimited vacation and gaming companies do not;;
*cries in debt*;;
So in theory, I'd probably enjoy the work more for a gaming company but I'd have less time to enjoy my personal life. Stick with this company now, might not like the work as much but I can go crazy with my personal life. Damn this sucks lol;;
WHY IS LIFE SO COMPLICATED;;
lol I feel you <@455797717763883009>;;
Obviously I will just keep working at my current job and probably still apply to gaming jobs and see if anything works out for me I guess. So far it hasnt and Ive been trying for almost 2 years lol;;
DAMN. 2 years?;;
yeah but I have zero experience in the gaming world, other than playing games lol so it makes sense why I havent gotten any offers;;
I hate hard decisions like that, <@416803598173995018> . I can relate to your struggle;;
If you would be doing the same amount of hours for more money. Can't you accept that and keep pursuing the gaming job you want?;;
Yeah that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm going to be doing. Just keep working here, still pursue gaming work and see where it goes. Worst case scenario, which isn‚Äôt bad lol is that I stay here, have a good benefits and good pay but just not completely love the work;;
Yeah, that seems like a good plan. Is what I would do.;;
And if I can share something that I learned as someone who got to work with something they love doing: There will always be annoying and boring parts to deal with even when you love the work.;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_TWcFP3aQI;;
omggg;;
I need this game inside me;;
I mean, inside my xbox;;
games on xbox here in Brazil are cheaper;;
it's like 40 BRL cheaper than on Ps4;;
In the dongle box;;
I'm so tempted to get the collectors edition;;
<@467974634977886220>  - yeah that's good advice.;;
;;
work is always gonna be work;;
<@416803598173995018> you better listen, or I am going to yaya all over your face;;
One more time, my plane landed safely. Don't be so disappointed  <@488734758847905803>;;

Hey <@87241615671832576> how you doing today?;;
<@416803598173995018> just wanted to chime in on your job dilemma...;;
I would stay with your current jobby job, get more fat stacks of money, and still have the same amount of personal time for Mrs. Changeover and for gaming.;;
But keep plugging away at those gaming jobs! You never know when one will open up!;;
Hello <@87241615671832576>;;
haha  <@207416847019016202>  my name comes from me being the junior to my father, so the second  Jay üòÉ;;

*dab dab dab;;
*floss floss floss;;
<@409836692158021632> that's the plane my dude! Unless something happens with a gaming company lol then it will be a tough decision. Once I make district manager by the end of this year, it will be tough to go away from that job. Gonna be lot's of money there....plus like I said, loads of time for my personal life;;
Now you're speaking my language  <@409836692158021632>;;
For me personally game dev looks like very nervous and unstable place to work.;;
ah true <@250095777509146624>;;
I know your language too. Waffles!  <@498246547838992414>;;
gonna take a shower and stream some more Metro 2033!;;

<@498246547838992414> only talks in waffles;;
<@207416847019016202> yeah game development does seem that way;;
So all this time you spoke to us unshowered? Ew  <@488734758847905803>;;
Wow guys, funny <@488734758847905803> <@207416847019016202>;;
So I wouldn't do it. I don't mean if I were you, I mean I will not do it  <@416803598173995018>;;
<@416803598173995018> Advance congrats on the District Manager bump! ;;
make sure it's a real promotion and they're not just giving you the ;;
assistant to the assistant manager position ;;
üòÇ;;

<@409836692158021632> lol hasnt happened yet, by the end of the year most likely. The pay will just be next to impossible to turn down though so;;
Gettin' dat cash <@416803598173995018>;;
YAYA;;

Still top ten at least <@498246547838992414>;;

And I've died like 569 times
It's all good lmao
very supportive community but also very twisted lol
I think <@250095777509146624> is just watching us and asking himself what went wrong with human evolution
Are you sure it's even evolution? <@498246547838992414>
when <@488734758847905803> gets back he'll give you the basic run down
but for the most part, like Changeover says, we try to support everyone here to the best that we can...depending on how much you can pay too...JK
I'm 6,90‚Ç¨ an hour
Cheap
For me you need to buy McDonald's morning menu

Hahahhahah
I just realized it's been a long ass time that I've done karaoke.. it's a disgrace to my countrymen!
longs big ass?
hahaha
they will revoke your citizenship!!!
i think i did karaoke just couple of times...
last was 15 years ago
I know! Don't tell the governement!
Karaoke is not a thing there <@207416847019016202> ?
it is
but usually you need real life friends for that
and all i have are living in different cities
and even if i have friends in the city and they suggest something like that, im usually like fuck you""";;
so i guess its not a thing for me;;
Lmao;;
Down here it's a thing for the rich people, or wanna be rich people;;
wanna be rich is something like having just 2 beach houses? <@348165887347523594>;;
"I'm not even at ""I dream to be a wanna be rich""  level üòÖ <@207416847019016202>";;
haha;;
so no karaoke for you <@348165887347523594>;;
just for rich potatoes <@526319824704634881>;;
Hahaha.. karaoke is a big thing here.. rich and poor.. Pinoys looove karaoke! <@409836692158021632> will confirm..;;

Love you both;;
Love ya <@537319907541516311> ;;
‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§;;

You guys did a great job;;
And yes, I can confirm the karaoke thirst üòÇ;;
üíú üíú üíú üíú <@537319907541516311>;;
hey <@526319824704634881> , how is work going this morning?;;
Pretty busy..so I wasn't as active in chat earlier.. how's your day/night going <@348165887347523594> ?;;
It has been a laid back day. Today was the last carnaval day, and I'm happy it's done. I hate this time of the year. I try to stay home as much as possible. People lose their shit here when it's carnaval.  I plan on playing some more Anthem and Wolfenstein 2 this evening. Good luck at work <@526319824704634881>;;
Going to finish both games in one night?;;
I finish Anthem's campaign yesterday, but there is still content I haven't done...so not done yet. And I'm sure I can finish Wolfenstein 2 tonight;;
So, I'm probably going to play Wolfenstein 2 in priority though;;
Once I'm done with it, I'm jumping back to RDR2 and going to focus on it until done;;
So many games lined up..;;
Let me know when you want to play coop.. üòÅ;;
I'm ready when you're ready <@526319824704634881>;;
I'll send you a message.. üòÅ;;
I have like 20 to 30 games lined up lol...I promessed myself that I will stop buying games until I'm done with at least 10 of them;;
<@526319824704634881> No problem üòâ;;
20-30? Damn! lol;;
Yeah, these last two years I've been buying a bunch of games, but never kept up with them;;
And I still want to do my second, third and fourth playthrough Nier Automata. To appreciate what this game is really about. The first playthrough is just the tip of the iceberg .;;
ahhh ok. Never heard of nier automata before;;
Really??? Reeeaaaaaaaally??????;;
lol nope, never;;
It's one ps4 major game that came out for pc a bit more than a year ago;;
It has more than 20 different endings, different stories....it's crazy;;
damn thats crazy. What kind of game is it?;;
Third person action, rpg;;
hmm interesting. Ill look into it;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKdP9mmJA-A;;
It was one of 2017 best game judging from most game reviews.;;
Hmmm looks interesting. Might have to check it out;;
üòâ;;
Omg <@348165887347523594> I love that you play Nier! I haven't finished it but totally love that game! üòç;;
Yeah it's a piece of art...the entire game is phenomenal. I have only finished the first playthrough...But the first playthrough is far from finishing the game. Starting from the third playthrough it's a different story with different characters, dialogues and outcomes. Maybe once I finally get back and finish RDR2, I get back to Nier. Tomorrow I'll be diving back to RDR2 for sure and focus on that game only for a while.;;
Hey @everyone;;
Yyello <@448648678224429068> , how are you?;;

Hey <@207416847019016202>;;
Ah;;
i dont care about your brazilian games, tell me about cat;;
Kinda;;
We brought him to her house when she still lived with her parents;;
But now he still lives with them;;
He's super cool. He's like a dog, he plays fetch and shit hahaha;;
But he has one major issue;;
He pisses and shits around the house. He has like a mental issue I think haha;;
wow thats a cool cat;;
And whenever he uses the litter box, instead of shoveling sand on his business as all cats do, he starts like, rubbing his paw on the wall. It's hilarious;;
I'll send a video of him playing fetch tonight or tomorrow;;
haha i know one cat exactly like that;;
he spent all his life avoiding litter box;;
Hahaha really?;;
and he went far for that. i mean, like, you know, wait when nobody will watch and stuff. and after that going NEAR litter box and do his business;;
its always near;;
not in random room, but near litter box;;
and if someone is near, he will wait long time;;
It's him;;
Is he/she your cat?;;
Or was?;;
Hahaha omg that's so weird;;
That he'd wait;;
he was mine/my parents, but then i moved from them, and then my parents moved to moscow, so now its cat of our good friends;;
hes 12;;
That could be Garfield  <@207416847019016202>;;
That's awesome <@207416847019016202>;;
Did you feed him lasagna?;;
What's his name?;;
That orange cat is Gohan;;
We couldn't think of a name and then womango's brother was just like;;
He's a fat ass, how about gohan?;;
Lmao <@455797717763883009>;;
His name is TImosha (which is real russian name), and mango version of name would be just Tim;;
i meant short version;;
Lmao;;
Mango is now synonymous to short;;
yeah it is;;
from now on;;
Someone please inform Merriam Webster;;
Hahaha;;
Fok;;
Well, at least purple herpes hasn't  spread yet and become a thing;;
Oh no!;;
i read news, purple herpes is all over brasil;;
Ops, I guess I fucked more people's lives up;;
Lmao;;
Herple;;
Leaks say that even Bolsanaro has it;;
Oh him I don't care at all;;
The son of a bitch;;
Apparently he tweeted something yesterday?;;
i dont have any idea who are you talking about;;
The Brazilian President;;
He's such an asshole;;
Man, I wish he stepped on Legos for eternity;;
While having his face all sticky and his hands tied;;
Motherfucker;;

or even know him;;

Meh. John Oliver never made me laugh I feel;;
He's smart and all;;
But I dunnl;;
If you haven't seen it yet <@207416847019016202>;;
There's something about him that annoys me more than I can say;;
Haha, he's British;;
yeah im more jimmy fallon kind of guy;;
For me, these guys are my source of news. Not really comedy;;
well i dont care about anything aside comedy and game news;;
so, like, usual news - i dont care;;
its usually some politics;;
I do care about politics;;
cause fuck injustice;;
but I understand;;
anyway;;

(name of my novel);;
fuck injustice of course, but i will let others do the fucking and will spend my life just enjoying;;
games, movies, comedies, programming, music - i have a lot of responsibilities in life;;
<@488734758847905803>  Have you been to Black Forest?;;

i will stream limbo in an hour;;
i played LA Noire on ps3, and i didnt finished it, did only half i think;;
so i wanted to do it for a long time;;
I haven't been playing and watching much for the past few weeks. Responsibilities, parenting, husband duties, work, and I've just been so tired, so I can't stay up late.;;
 husband duties sounds so funny;;
Lol. That was the aim.;;
yeah last time I played was on ps3 too;;

Solid song, not great but not bad;;
Yeah not bad either;;
Gold on the Ceiling is still my favourite;;
Lonely boy or tighten up are up there for me;;

I think little black submarines was the first one I ever heard;;

Okay bro, do u only stream on twitch?;;
Do u have a pc;;
I personally only stream on twitch;;
I have a PC that can't run games lol;;
We need to talk on the side I got a couple tricks to show u lol;;
But I use it with my capture card;;
<@488734758847905803> I feel that dude.  Saving up for a new graphics card rn;;
What kinda tricks? Sounds dirty;;
Yeah I know what you mean <@250095777509146624>;;
Lol wanna stream on multiple platforms at once? And quality control for your streams lol I mean I been doing it for awhile so I just know lol;;
I got a Alienware Aurora R9 nitrogen coolant. Graphics card Nividia GTX 1080i;;
Good job <@!405560388504125471>, your dongle just grew to 2!;;
With my God of war ps4 pro lol;;
It helps to work for Gamestop and Bestbuy at the same time lmao;;
Saving to get a 2060;;
Bro u made out of money??? <@250095777509146624>;;
Lol you built your own right?;;
Nah man it's only $450 <@405560388504125471>;;
And yeah I built my own;;
Online right now says 299 hold up;;
Nevermind 389;;
Sorry;;
The one I want is the ROG strix varient;;
Isnt that the equivalence to a 1070 nividia;;
PC gamer website selling it for 349;;
Where can I post the link?;;
I'm just gonna drop it here someone copy and paste it where it's supposed to go;;
drop it here;;
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pcgamer.com/amp/nvidia-rtx-2060-graphics-cards-are-now-on-sale-starting-at-dollar349/;;
It's more akin to a 1070ti;;
Competes with a 180 though;;
I can see that;;
If u need help with configs let me know I gotchu on my streams I run it on blue ray but it still does a little frames drop when u move;;
However if it's a recording there is no frame drop;;
Ahh man I know fairly well about PC builds and such, I appreciate it though very much so;;
Lol I just love helping as u can tell lol;;
Nothing wrong with that brother! I'll drop you a follow on twitch my dude üòä;;
I appreciate that. Do u know about Restream?;;
Yeah, not a user sense I'm an affiliate but I do know of it;;
Well u should see if u would like to get into that because multiplatform streaming helps bro. Last 48 days I gained 104 subs on YouTube because I linked my mixer. Twitch, my YouTube and Facebook;;
I can show u everything . Lol I can show u the world! Shining shimmering splendor lol;;
Well once you've become an affiliate you can't link to another site I believe. Well at least you can't make money from it as a streamer.;;
Good job <@!250095777509146624>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
Azralyn does it all the time lol. That's weird;;
She streams on twitch and YouTube at the same time;;
Twitch is very finiky, I know some people who've lost their affiliation/partnership for it. I believe it's all about whether or not you make money from it;;
So they force u to stream on their page and only them;;
More or less;;
Ehhh YouTube has their issues too. I used to get paid until they raised the Sub count I get over 26,000 mins watched every 48 days;;
Good job <@!405560388504125471>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
But they just kill me man with these new algorithms I swear if they raise up the sub count I'll die lol;;
I'll just lay down right, and die;;
Lmao I feel it dude. I'll be sure to sub, dm me your link and I'll watch some videos with no adblock ‚ù§Ô∏è;;
its in <#546123700852752394>;;
hahaha;;
Orange...always watching...;;
orange always is enough;;
says it all;;
Lmaooo;;
Is your link in their too?;;
Actually no lmao I haven't posted it yet;;
Lol ooh okay;;
hey <@405560388504125471> , sorry for not answering before lol.;;
nah, just twitch is good.;;
So, yeah <@250095777509146624> is actually right;;
you can't stream the same content to two places at the sametime;;
Ahhh okay no problem bro lol. I do bro;;
haha true;;
be careful!;;
Soo there‚Äôs no internet at the other location I oversee now lol. Working on that so I won‚Äôt be as active in the afternoons here for the time being;;
You gonna stream today? <@488734758847905803>;;

Pretty much lol <@207416847019016202> I‚Äôm gonna but a router and hook it up to the Ethernet port though so that should solve the problem;;
Ahh ok <@488734758847905803> gotta do work?;;
yeah, football translations <@416803598173995018>;;
Buy a router I meant *;;
What exactly are football translations?;;
translations related to football;;
real football though;;
"not ""uh-mur-i-can"" football";;
lol jk;;
but really tho;;
yeah, changeover call football correctly;;
I didn‚Äôt call it incorrectly lol. I just didn‚Äôt know what he was translating. Old games? Books on football?;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;

What holiday is it?;;
international womens day;;
its an offical holiday in russia;;
day when all the men give presents to women;;
Yea It's recognized most places, but I've never heard of time off from work.;;
and feb 23rd is only-russian man day (connected to army and stuff), so all women give presents to men;;
both days in russia is off work;;
That's cool;;
when i was in school, only womens day was off;;
by then they changed it;;
so 8march and week before that in russia is kinda top peak period for flower sellers;;
My birthday is coming 13th;;
Can you send me something? üéÅ üéâ üí∞;;
only waves of love and hate <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;

At least it's not a fart in a box. Or a dongle.;;
it might be farting dongle though;;
Impressive.;;
I'm at work  <@207416847019016202>;;
yeah, i guessed so;;
Good job <@!207416847019016202>, your dongle just grew to 32!;;

Thank you! :);;
Your welcome! How‚Äôre you today?;;
I am great after this one. So overall I am great, how are you <@524820041976250368> ?;;
I‚Äôm good but tired haha <@87241615671832576>;;
hey folks, I'm launching an album!;;
https://jonnyplayslive.bandcamp.com/releases;;
it's called streamer companion, with 17 tracks that can be used in any streams or videos. All music composed, performed and produced by myself üòÉ;;
nice!;;
just saw that you did well <@87241615671832576> hahah;;
glad to hear you finished the first part, congratulations!;;
taking a quick break from working;;
cause it's been 6 straight hours lol;;
Definitely need that break then!;;
yeah;;
transcribing with timecodes is so tough;;
it takes waaaay too long;;
Oh I bet;;
Good morning;;
hey there <@311684705810513921>;;
caught me on the end of my break;;
How's it going?;;
my boss is such a dick;;
Ah, RIP;;

Tell him you deserve a raise;;
hbu?;;
that prick won't give it to me;;
Yeah, tired as well. Been up since 430am for work as well;;
Bastard, probably makes more than anyone and keeps it all to himself;;
yeah;;
he's such a cheap fuck;;
haha;;
smh;;
yeah, i've been up since around that time too;;
crazy shit;;
it's way too early;;
no human being should wake up before 7;;
Right?;;
I'm a night owl;;
I don't like getting up early;;
I like to be able to enjoy the day and all, and I only need 6-7 hours of sleep msot of the time;;
but damn man;;
waking up early like that is inhumane;;
no one else sleeps when you sleep;;
no one else is awake when youre awake;;
it's ghost town;;
back to work for me;;
awaaaay;;
<@488734758847905803> Im up early too lol;;
not fun;;
Have fun <@488734758847905803>;;
Morning all!;;
I do like the quiet though super late at night;;
it's nice;;
night time is the best;;
used to work overnight shifts, loved it;;
morning <@416803598173995018>;;
I hate -working- at night;;
I like being alone at night and doing whatever I want;;
Hey <@207416847019016202> how are you?;;
im wonderful;;
yeah Id rather be at home during the night but working during the night was pretty nice too. It was so quiet, no traffic;;
just chiling and coding a little;;
very nice <@207416847019016202>;;
plans for the weekend?;;
ill stream tomorrow i think, and that is all plans;;
Which game will you be streaming? Any stream today?;;
no, but my tomorrow stream will be today for you;;
11 pm for you;;
its time for LA Noire baby;;
i finished limbo;;
ahh ok, I might be up for that. Will try my best at least;;
oh nice that you finished limbo;;
"okay game, but ""inside"" is muuch cooler (its kinda sequel)";;
i would stream inside if i wouldnt play it last year;;
ahh I see. It was a fun game to watch you play though, very entertaining;;
yeah, and i tell you, inside is better;;
its more emotional i would say;;
Ahh ok, maybe you will stream it again this year?;;
haha maybe;;
you see, limbo stream was not so good in terms of views;;
by the way thanks, you really watched whole game <@416803598173995018>;;
You're welcome, it was fun to watch! Luckily I had the time to watch at work yesterday lol. I am not so lucky every day;;
yeah, stupid people need to eat;;
hungry americans;;
lol yeah and now that I am overseeing 2 accounts, I am much busier than before but its good. Makes the day go by faster;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
<@207416847019016202> we have to talk alot today so you can move past mango and I can separate from Kelly lol;;
Morning mangos;;
Hey! <@287320205020102667> how you doing ?;;
Not too bad and you?;;
Pretty good! Happy it's Friday, been a long week;;
Let's talk  <@416803598173995018>. What are your childhood fears?;;
"lol the biggest fear I had when I was a kid was sharks. I watched the movie ""jaws"" when I was really young and it scarred me for life haha";;
changeover, same thing happened to my brother. We would vacation in California and he would never get in the ocean because of Jaws;;
Lol yep! I still won‚Äôt go past my knees in the ocean. Fascinated by sharks but absolutely terrified by them at the same time;;
I think I was about 6 or 7 when I saw jaws;;
i remember watching movie about piranhas in movie theater when i was 10. and after that me and my mom and brother went through the pier, there was rotten body of someone, apparently fishermen just pulled it out of the water <@416803598173995018>;;
Oh damn. That would mess me up!;;
haha i didnt care;;
my real fear is rats;;
im okay if its kinda pet rat, i even had one, it was alright;;
but street rats scare me;;
good thing that in moscow you can see rat in the street, i dont know, one time in 1-2 years;;
We had a lot of big rats in Boston. Some were as big as a small cat lol. You'd hate it;;
Good job <@!416803598173995018>, your dongle just grew to 27!;;
YEAH!;;
just a few more messages and you will move ahead of mango <@207416847019016202>;;
haha;;
yeah i really would hate it;;
i dont think i ever saw big rats;;
they didnt care about people either, they would run up to you and bite at you to get food;;
just very small ones, and still my legs are shaking when i see them;;
fuck thats messed up;;
i literally can count times when i saw rats on the street in last 10 years;;
these ones are big lol. Well over 30 cm long;;
and it were small ones;;
they are only out in the spring and summer though. Im assuming they hide or die in the winters;;
yeah thats still messed up;;
also i kinda scared of dogs, but not that way as rats, just if they are agressive and alone;;
yeah some dogs can be scary. I love dogs though, always had at least 2 my whole life;;
"in moscow you can walk into some ""factory"" disctricts, with warehouses and such, and you can stumble upon some dogs barking at you. for me its the only thing that is scaring about moscow";;
you wont be robbed or something;;
oh yeah that would be scary. They are probably territorial and aggressive dogs;;
yeah, they are;;
I dont like big spiders either;;
small ones I dont care but big ones are not ok;;
never bit me though;;
once i just covered my legs with my bag, and dog decided not continue her attack;;
well thats good. I have been bit a couple times but never that badly;;
yeah of course i dont talk about small ones. they are always belong to somebody. and i talking about guard dogs, who is not on the leash;;
oh I meant small and big spiders lol. I hate big spiders but yeah guard dogs are scary, only ran into a few and one chased me once lol I jumped a fence to get away;;
oh sorry, i misread;;
i dont scared of spiders, but there are no big ones in russia;;
only small;;
same for cockroaches, no big ones;;
we have both big spiders and cockroaches here. Dont like either lol;;
yeah thats terrible haha;;
btw we didnt see any dogs in dubai;;
even in industrial shady almost scary districts;;
it was 100% safe, no unleashed dogs;;
no dogs at all? or only ones on leashes?;;
we didnt see or hear any;;
theres a lot of construction sites;;
and in russia there could be dogs on them;;
but in dubai there wasnt;;
Hmm I wonder why. Maybe too hot and they are all inside? lol;;
haha i dont know;;
we also saw few cats;;
a lot less then in turkey;;
maybe its because its really hot there in summer;;
now its okay, up to 30;;
We have a lot of stray cats in my neighborhood, I hate them lol;;
we love cats so much, especially when they are in our neighbourhood;;
These ones are bad. They make everything smell gross and they dig up my garden in the front lol;;
I dont mind cats but I dont like the stray ones. They always fight too and are really loud lol;;
does everyone in la has private house?;;
by private i mean, not an appartment in big building;;
No, lots of big apartments everywhere. There are private houses also but a lot of the neighborhoods are condensed so the house are close together with no yards but theres also lots of area where the houses have lots of yard, private gates and all that. Those are the richer areas lol;;
and which one you have?;;
Apartment building, not a big one tough. Its 1 units that are stacked next to each other in a row. I guess they technically call them townhouses. So its a row of 9 units all attached and next to each other. Kind of hard to explain;;
if its appartment building, how came you have a garden?;;
each unit has its on stairs into their apartment and we all have a little patch of grass in the front. Let me send pic;;
i let you!;;
by the way, where are you <@488734758847905803> ;;
maybe you are under my table sucking?;;
!rank;;
;;
So that‚Äôs the front of my apartment. The back is a garage;;
and you can see the others units that are down the walkway also;;
so only people next to me, no one above or below;;
oh okay i got it;;
so not typical appartment building;;
your door is separate as i understand;;
and each unit is 3 levels. Bottom is garage, middle is kitchen and living room and top is bedrooms;;
yes not typical apartment;;
ORANGE IS BACK AT #1;;
all is right in the world lol;;
i agree;;
and yes each door is separate and only goes into each persons apartment;;
catch up now;;
Trying to while Mango is busy lol;;
yeah;;
you need to provide him with more work;;
lol yeah we should so I cant catch up and you can separate from him more;;
haha yeah;;
i hate being near him;;
lol yeah I can tell;;
too sweaty;;
Sounds like what we directly call a House Row;;
or Row house üòÑ Because all apartments lie in line of each other;;
oh yeah thats a good name for it <@87241615671832576> and I've definitely heard that before;;
hey <@87241615671832576>;;
how are you;;
Hello @orange and <@416803598173995018>;;
I am good, just waiting to be able to put the kids to bed. so I can stream Satisfactory;;
and it looks like I've had loads of competition on that game unfortunately, but I've enjoyed the Alpha so far and I want to start all over again with what i've learned;;
what is Satisfactory?;;
i will try to watch your stream;;
And to be honest <@416803598173995018> I didn't think you guy overseas had housing like that üòÉ;;
<@87241615671832576> what game will you be streaming? Yeah they are pretty common, at least in the areas I've lived in;;
If you know factorio, it's like that, but in 3D. ;;
You spawn into a world and start building a factory, which will produce stuff you send out into space.;;
I found it very addiction after I started;;
i saw factorio couple of times;;
There's no waves of aliens, it's more focused on the building aspect;;
oh that sounds cool;;
some people, like changeover and kelly, love to see streams of games they would never play;;
Well isn't that kind of a streamers bread and butter? üòÑ;;
My problem is I want to play EVERYTHING and it's honestly a big problem as I never experience the games I never get to stream üòÑ;;
It's a catch 22;;
maybe, i dont know, i dont see a point n watching somebody playing any game. i only enjoy interaction with streamer;;
true, that's another perspective. I've heard about streamers who have a primary following of people who need to sleep to something and they chose a specific streamer üòÑ;;
Honestly all demographics are there;;
haha i got that too, <@348165887347523594>  and <@524820041976250368>  love to sleep at my streams;;
And if I ever was a person people wanted to sleep while having  while streaming I'd be honered, as I see it as some sort of trust;;
lol yeah I really enjoyed watching <@207416847019016202> play limbo but  I probably would not ever play that gam;;
game*;;
exactly;;
I usually only watch people stream the games that I stream so I can get better and pick up what they are doing;;
i would never do that;;
"for one, ""getting better in game"" is really not for me";;
especially when watching someone;;
I try not to be asleep for your streams I can‚Äôt help that the time zones are differentüòÇ <@207416847019016202>;;
You just have a soothing voice üòâ;;
haha no i dont;;
my gf is always saying that i scream too much in my streams;;
speaking too loud i mean;;
Lol üòÑ;;
for some screaming are soothing;;
or something like that;;
<@207416847019016202> for me and the games I play, it is important. Rainbow six siege and apex require a certain skill and people that play them full time are obviously better than me. So my goal is to watch what they do and try to do the same if possible. It sometimes makes me a better player and thats what I want out of those games;;
His voice is pretty soothing haha üòÇ;;
lol yeah I like oranges voice too;;
<@526319824704634881> said I should do ASMR I think its called?;;
she said my voice is very calming lol. I always thought my voice was annoying;;
I like your voice too it is calming <@416803598173995018>;;
Thanks! <@524820041976250368> I disagree but everyone keeps saying that it's nice so lol;;
It is! Haha;;
as i already said, nobody cares what you think about your own voice <@416803598173995018>;;
Your voice is calming too! <@207416847019016202> especially when you start singing üíú;;
Lol thanks <@207416847019016202> guess I will just accept that people think I have a nice voice;;
you even dont have right to accept it <@416803598173995018>;;
btw when your next stream? <@416803598173995018>;;
Hopefully tomorrow;;
Not sure what time yet but I will stream last of us;;
good;;
stream 101, make soothing sounds, just stream AMSR xD;;

nope;;
jajaja;;

that's spanish you fok;;
hahahahaha;;
it's kkkkkkk;;
I know;;
RACIST;;
omg  I KNOW;;
it's not supposed to be though;;
only in Murica though;;
it's  because that's how brazilians laugh;;
"they say like ""kakakakakaakakaka""";;
oh really? I did not know that lol;;
"the pronunciation of K in portuguese is ""Ka""";;
that's why we say kkkkkk;;
it's so much easier than lol too;;
kaka is poop in russian <@488734758847905803> ;;
imagine how russians felt about football player kaka;;
lol yeah same here <@207416847019016202>;;
kaka is poop in portuguese too;;
but it's spelt cac√°;;
caca*;;
lmao yeah, we always make that joke h ere;;
kak√° is short for ricardo;;
english is weird too;;
because how in the fuck is Bill  short for william?;;
and dont even get me started on dick / richard;;
interesting lol. I know several people from Brasil but they dont laugh that way. They had only been here for a few years so maybe they just got used to the american way or something?;;
and dick for richard;;
maybe <@416803598173995018>;;
it's relatively  new;;
we got same here;;
Im Vladimir, and short for that is Vova;;
it's digital;;
Vova?;;
that's almost grandma in portuguese;;
lol yeah America is tough. My grandmother had the hardest time adjusting to stuff like that and slang words when she first came here;;
haha <@488734758847905803>;;
babushka;;
yeah same here <@416803598173995018> with me;;
yeah, learn more russian;;
niet;;
da da;;
hopefully I spelled that right lol;;
learn it;;
da niet;;
I will learn a little;;
just to call you babushka more elaborately;;
lol;;
i dont think theres a right way to spell russian words in english haha <@416803598173995018> ;;
"i would say just net, but i understand why english speakers feel to add ""i"" there";;
what about babushka?;;
babushka is grandmother;;
no clue <@207416847019016202>;;
what about it;;
I was just wondering if it was spelt in an acceptable way;;
no clue about what? <@416803598173995018> ;;
you misread again?;;
100% as i would spell it <@488734758847905803>;;
yep lol I read too fast;;
nice;;
read slow <@416803598173995018> , youre still learning;;
yeah, changeover usually read only half of the words. which is still a lot;;
actually no lol. I am a speed reader so you get taught to skip words sometimes or whatever so I glaze over stuff alot here;;
as i said, only half words...;;
so actually orange, you are right lol;;
haha yeah;;
yeaaaah boi;;
actually;;

he's a cool guy;;
super intelligent too;;
he has a phd in political sciences from HARVARD;;
yeah totally, I just find him so fascinating. From his world views to his guitar style;;
the shit he does with a guitar, no one else has or maybe ever will;;
not such a fan of all the electric shit he does with the guitar;;
I fucking love it;;
but I give him points for creativity;;
so unique;;
yeah for creative;;
be back in a bit;;
same;;
Hey, just asking, which is better Player.me or StreamLabs obs?;;
i use second one and never heard about first;;
It's on the streaming tools tab in twitch video producer tab, maybe it's new. I was just checking it out;;
you finally want to start streaming?;;
I was just checking it out really. Just to test if it would work with my upload;;
good;;
Streamlabs is a good way to go if your just starting out, makes things pretty damn easy;;
Good job <@!275429891774742531>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
Ok thanks <@275429891774742531>;;
i am DONE;;
with the first part;;
gonna take a shower now;;
Nice <@488734758847905803>;;
wooooot;;
what up <@448648678224429068>;;
is first part like 21%?;;
Not much just chillin thinking about getting a different laptop if I had the money;;
haha;;
just about <@207416847019016202>;;
true <@448648678224429068>;;
pc's are expensive af;;
I just need one that I can use for my stream;;
correction, good PCs are expensive AF;;
Since my hp won‚Äôt find my capture card even though it‚Äôs plugged into my 3.0 usb;;
I accept this correction <@275429891774742531>;;
I have seen that before imatrix, it can be caused by too much on the same usb bus as your capture card. Try consolidating some of your usb devices and try different USB ports;;
on a lappy I know you are limited if that is the case;;
I don‚Äôt have anything else plugged in to my USB ports it‚Äôs a brand new laptop bought just for streaming;;
your keyboard, trackpad, and built in webcam are all on the USB hub by default;;
plus whatever they decided to tack on;;
I had to do the same thing with my big boy puter I am on now, dedicated usb interface just for capture card, only way it will work;;
So I need to figure out where my usb hub is and remove them;;
well more of look in your device manager and see if there is one that is free from anything else and then plug in your device until it falls under that one;;
Ok I will try that when I get home hopefully I can figure it out;;
let me know I will try and help if I am available;;
Will do thanks a lot;;
Hey guys!;;
^ Look at this dbags profile picture;;

"buy the way its a common curse phrase in russian - something like ""go to dick""";;

probably, but i think i dont;;
TRUE;;
Hey all;;
How was the rest of the stream? <@207416847019016202>;;
not much dying, so not typical orange stream <@416803598173995018>;;
Ahh that‚Äôs good then lol;;
rest of the stream was mostly discussing <@537319907541516311> slutiness;;
Lmao was he there?;;
yep;;
Oh nice;;
"he said something about feeling only left part of his body, and i remembered that in russian ""going left"" means cheating";;
Haha oh ok, didn‚Äôt know that;;
yeah, its just a phrase, you wouldnt know that;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
BURN;;
ok;;
back to work;;
I'm procrastinating;;
hm. now im realising that my last message seemed a little orangy;;
but i didnt mean any sarcasm or something like that;;

;;
shh, look <@416803598173995018> , he's got a heart!;;
yeah, please put knife away, put my heart back and close my chest <@488734758847905803>;;
Lol it‚Äôs all good <@207416847019016202> I know you didn‚Äôt mean sarcasm or anything;;
morning internet peoples;;
morning <@275429891774742531>;;
hey <@275429891774742531>;;
Have a great weekend everyone ‚ù§;;
You too  <@409836692158021632>;;
<@207416847019016202>  I hope my slutiness made for a good stream. I enjoyed your civillian cleansing on LA Noire.;;
Yeah, my goal is to purge LA population;;
Sorry everyone. Cam etc for my stream will have to wait until the end of June. Can‚Äôt justify spending money on Twitch right now when I have to save for a wedding lol. I know I said I‚Äôd try to get it this weekend but it doesn‚Äôt feel right to spend money on gear instead of the wedding;;
I gotcha <@416803598173995018>;;
I'm sorry youre getting married;;
nah jk haha;;
Your stream can  still rely on your voice for now;;
i usually dont feel empathy, but really, im very sorry dude, my deep condolences about wedding <@416803598173995018>;;
lmao;;
Lol classic orange. Mrs changeover was actually ok with it but it just didn‚Äôt feel ok. Save for the wedding is the more appropriate thing to do. Streaming will always be there but wedding is once (hopefully lol);;
i understand that;;
lmao;;
you want to be in the best dress on your wedding;;
Lol I love your sense of humor. It‚Äôs just like my friends haha;;
you hope that this wedding will be your last because you want to spend rest of your life with mrs changeover, or because weddings are fucking expensive?;;
okay that was last haha;;
Haha both!;;
but mostly second, right? <@416803598173995018>;;
okay that last really was unnesessary;;
i will return to whatever im doing;;
lol yeah mostly that. I‚Äôd never want to do this all again haha;;
What‚Äôs up @everyone;;
Morning;;
hey <@448648678224429068> <@348165887347523594>;;
did you sleep <@348165887347523594>;;
Just woke up buddy;;
Now, my stomach is screaming for food;;
FOOOOOOOOOD it says;;
dongle food;;
hell yeah lol;;
It won't calm down;;
But it will have to wait, Wolfenstein 2 is a priority;;
fok ya;;
So I tried streaming a game with steam's spectator mode yesterday and apparently it was working fine. I wonder if it will be as good with twitch;;
I was broadcasting at 720p and maximum bitrate was 2500kb/s;;
cool;;
30 frames?;;
Yes;;
if you can, i'd try to go to 3000 kbs bitrate;;
but 2500 is acceptable;;
I'll try, but my upload isn't that great;;
How are you all;;
I guess that there is a possibility to test drive streamlabs ocb right? Stream for just a friend?;;
Good how are you <@448648678224429068>;;
I‚Äôm good will be better once I get my stream fixed;;
I understand;;
I‚Äôm so close I can taste it lol;;
I can‚Äôt wait to test it out I will just need to fix my obs if I can get my laptop it run it;;
I hope you'll be able to sort it out as quick as possible.;;
I'm installing obs for the first time. Just to test it out;;
I‚Äôm going to test it on my elgato capture app if I can get it to work to;;
Noice;;
Yeah I may have to change internets lol;;
Yoooo <@348165887347523594> streaming is great news this weekend! ;;
Looking forward to it!!!;;
I hope you get your set up fixed as well <@448648678224429068>;;
Thanks <@409836692158021632>;;
<@409836692158021632> I'm just going to test it out bro üòÖ;;
But thanks;;
It's always exciting to see people start streaming!;;
"I just wanna see you yell ""You foking Dongle!"" into the camera!!! ";;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
I've even heard that <@526319824704634881> might start streaming too when Twitch sings is out for everyone... üëÄ;;
Mango Karaoke nights would be awesome!!!;;
Haha, true true ....I've seen you guys are great singers indeed;;
Orange has that awesome hateful baritone! <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
haha, he does lol...That name for the channel/band sounds awesome...I may jump in <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Definitely! I'm hoping it's possible to do a multi-twitch for Twitch sings;;
hateful baritone lol <@409836692158021632>;;
If it turns out that I can stream, it would only be for pure fun. I thought it would motivate me more to play certain games. Sometimes playing alone gets boring. Thus I have a bunch of games that I haven't finished, or even started.;;
<@409836692158021632> I'm sure it will be;;
Oh no! I've summoned the big O!!! ;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
I hope you're able to stream, Kelly.;;
I sure do too. It works very well with steam's broadcasting mode. So there may be a chance;;
üôèüôèüôè;;
big O looks like big hole, i dont like it lol <@409836692158021632>;;
<@348165887347523594> is gonna start streaming?? YES!!!!;;
Good morning guys! ;;
You summoned me <@409836692158021632> ??;;
I'm not sure <@416803598173995018> , I just want to test it out üòÖ;;
Awesome man, would be cool for sure!;;
Woah?! You're gonna start streaming <@348165887347523594> ?!  Hype!!;;

lool;;
hey <@455797717763883009>;;
<:PM:539114910211112995>  this one <@488734758847905803>;;
Yo <@207416847019016202>;;
Is orange getting interviewed?;;
He will be either this week or next;;
depends on what?;;
Orange will be harassed by mango;;
depends on if i feel like it BITCH;;
nah jk;;
it depends on whether someone who had already semi-confirmed will confirm;;
show me who it is and i will torn off their semi;;
semi confirmed, sounds like Marklar;;
lmao;;
sounds more like <@160543395037708288>;;
hahaha;;
Sounds like fun;;
Fun indeed;;
OwO;;
yo slut, wait what?;;
And just saw the ambush question for Orange;);
Hello panda with six feet <@455797717763883009>;;
Picturing that, and its so weird lol;;
It's 6 pandas with 1 foot;;
spider-panda;;
*weird*;;
That's just sad <@87241615671832576>;;
haha landsby, that sounds cute;;
lmaaao <@455797717763883009>;;
Or else it would have been sixfeetpanda ;);
Hahaha;;
Or, six 1 foot pandas;;
mini panda;;
Yeahh;;
61 pandas;;
Also, the end is near;;
It's storming really bad;;
I've just finished making a pizza :);;
what flavor?;;
ooo which one;;
better have pineapple on it;;
mango flavor;;
Pineapple on pizza is good tbh;;
yeaaaah boi;;
zzzz;;
You could be killed doing that shit in south ital;;
italy*;;
*oh no*;;
But it's soooo good;;
Italy is a sham;;
it is so good;;
let's all move to russia;;
why would w e  EVER d o that?;;
EVER;;
unless someone paid us;;
Buy like a giant mansion;;
"And make it the ""mango house""";;
Like the team 10 mansion;;
But we're all streamers;;
someone pay mango;;
so he would move here;;
and die in a snow;;
I have 1‚Ç¨ in my steam account;;
Is that enough?;;
that will do;;
mango is cheap;;
just 69cents;;
oh, <@455797717763883009> knows pricelist;;
Yes;;
I'll give him my keyboard;;
The only thing of value I have;;
Filled with susage and pulled ham;;
*Hamwallet*;;
and real cheese and homemade tomatosouce;;
Sounds good <@87241615671832576>;;
whats real cheese lol;;
i've actually thought about making a food stream, as I cannot cook. So cooking for nerds xD;;
hahaha;;
I need that lol;;
I don't know <@455797717763883009> üòÑ;;
Real cheese is the kind that grows from trees;;
Yeahh i am still in the process of convincing the wife to be a part of it. As she's the good cook;;
I'd be down to watch;;
I like food;;
Did you guys see the Digital Foundry video on Sekiro?;;
no, what's that <@455797717763883009> ?;;
Nope, anything to worry about ?;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQItIcu9vvA&t=0s;;
Haha, nothing to worry about;;
it looks awesome lol;;

Damn;;
Damn indeed;;
You should be alright, you die like 3 to 4 times per day <@!498246547838992414>;;
Hahaha;;

I might die for real tho;;
That would suck big time;;
Stay safe bro;;
Yeah, thanks;;

Just until Wednesday;;
Ah true;;
Are you in a hotel?;;
It's weird traveling for business?;;
Isn't it*;;

So col <@416803598173995018> , enjoy every bit of it my man;;
Thanks! <@348165887347523594> I‚Äôll try and take pics of anything cool. Won‚Äôt have a ton of time to explore unfortunately;;
Yep, figures, but still, try to enjoy as much as you can, and if possible, some pictures would be cool üòâ;;
Will do my man!;;
<@498246547838992414> is it okay now? I think statistic didn't update because of you hosted someone;;
Morning <@207416847019016202>;;
Morning bro  <@348165887347523594>;;
Going to work? Or already at work?;;
Going;;
Ok;;
I found out that the game I was trying to stream yesterday was the wrong game to try.;;
Dobroye utro <@207416847019016202>  and <@348165887347523594> ;;
I hope you're both well üòä;;
If you guys didn't yet, go to <#554337661704208384> and read first pinned message there;;
Yes <@409836692158021632> , how are you doing;;
Dobroe utro  <@409836692158021632>;;
I have tried another game just now and it seem to be streaming well;;
I was trying Wolfenstein 2, but it wouldn't get detected;;
Yeah some games are harder to capture haha;;
Hey guys, sorry to bother but I just wanted to vent...;;
I'm pretty bummed out. ;;
I was supposed to make emotes for this streamer and I found out recently that they went and got work done from someone else.;;
Moron;;
I mean that streamer of course haha;;
I'm not sure I understood <@409836692158021632>;;
I had an agreement with a streamer that I was gonna make their emote.;;
There was no deadline.;;
Then I find out today that they had someone else make the emote.;;
Lets go on the voice channel <@409836692158021632> ?;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 27!;;
I understood. That streamer is fuck;;
Is he/she from here?;;
I understand that the streamer probably didn't want to wait anymore. ;;
"But our last convo said ""no rush""";;
This sucks <@409836692158021632> , but the answer can't be this simple. I would need to know more;;
I have had all kinds of fucked situations like this;;
<@348165887347523594> I'm guessing the streamer couldn't wait anymore for me to finish the emote and they decided to work with someone else.;;
"But what bothers me is the last convo where they said ""no rush""";;
He got exited;;
Mark you're 100% right here, that dude/dudesse is fucked up moron. And if they are here, then fuck you;;
Let it go, stop working for him, and he will come back;;
I think it would've been cool to give me the heads up first like;;
Hey, I'm gonna go with this person since you seem busy and haven't started it yet;;
Did you invest a lot?;;
I mean, time, and money;;
Yeah, it's still fresh so it will take some time to let go. Just sucks.;;
I had some preliminary designs that I started on.;;
It's ok. I'll probably give it to someone else so it doesn't go to waste.;;
Apologies for bringing this up.;;
It's just been bothering me a whole lot since I got the news. ;;
Appreciate y'all listening. ‚ù§;;
No apologies for this <@409836692158021632> ‚ù§ ‚ù§ . It's an honor that you wanted to talk about it with us;;
This is why I asked you if you didn't want to go on the voice chat channel so it would be easier to talk about it.;;
Ah I see. I cant go on voice chat unfortunately.;;
Appreciate you <@348165887347523594>;;
Don't let it beat you up <@409836692158021632> . Even good people do shit like that. I have done shit like that against my own will;;
What happened was fucked up. But it will happen again and again cause what you do people want it;;
"The streamer your talking about can't wait, or maybe stumbled on something that he felt was what he wanted right there right now. It happens to me all the time. When it does...I tell myself, ""fuckim"". Just how I spelled it, ""fuckim'. But doesn't make you or this streamer assholes.";;
True, <@348165887347523594> ;;
It just turned out like that through circumstance ;;
Thanks, man!;;
And thank you too <@207416847019016202> ;;
I'll mess with the orangebot tomorrow!;;
Mark i dont like empty words of support, but in this case youre 100% right, so dont bother, but maybe you need to come up with some protective measures in the future, like take money in advance (just assuming) <@409836692158021632>;;
and your preliminary designs you can always use for oragebot haha;;
by the way, i just got to work first time after vacation, and my laptop is already here, all fixed up (i got it broken day before vacation, but managed to give it to guy who repaired it and bringed it to the office);;
Haha;;
Thank you <@207416847019016202> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
It sucks <@409836692158021632>, I hope you'll be able to use it with another. Unfortunately there's only one thing you can do and that's let it slide and create top tier quality.;;
That's true and well said! Thank you <@87241615671832576> üòä;;
No worries :) and I am being patient about the one you wanted to create for me. I have no hurry at all :);;
üòÇ;;
no hurry, but you can use those designs....;;
üò≠;;
by the way thanks for teaching me english <@409836692158021632>;;
i had to google word vent because i didnt understand meaning;;
and apparently theres a lot of meanings to this simple word;;
and i found the right one;;
That's very true onemansorange. Those slang words can be tricky;;
yeah they can;;
üëÄ;;
Eyes in the dark !!;;
Peeking to see who's here.. I didn't want to make a sound coz someone might be sleeping..;;
Hey <@87241615671832576> !! How's your morning?;;
It does make sense üòÉ I've just removed sound from everything, so I see it when I see it and the phone won't effect me to much;;
It's good, I've had a 8 km bicycle trip, because my son needed to go the dentist for a routine look;;
Oh cool.. I hope everything is A okay..;;
it is, they said it was good üòÉ and he got himself a bouncing ball;;
yeah, discord on all my devices is silent too;;
might just be us old people, who don't want stuff to annoy us xD;;
Even though orange looks like a young fella;;
im 33;;
Same here, I guess that's for the bot xd;;
i turned off sounds on my phone when i moved to moscow 6 years ago  (i worked in big open space and didnt want to annoy people), so ever since my phone doesnt make notification sounds;;
Did you experience less stress from the phone afterwards? I did;;
no, vibration calls stress me not less;;
thats why i usually dont respond to numbers i dont know;;
and block a lot of numbers;;
calls are big stress for me;;
Ahh well I only have vibration for calls and I almost never get any, so it's fine for me. It's the notification sounds and vibrations from notifications which gives me stress;;
i almost get no calls to;;
but phone spam got huge last years;;
so at least couple times  week i receive some call;;
and a lot of times it is banks;;
Ahh bastards;;
sometime - my bank, and sometimes bank that i have card only because of football yearly ticket;;
and they trying to give me loans all the time;;
those fucks;;
yeahh never go for loans;;
or at least credit cards;;
i have one credit card, and its useful for rare occasions when you need money RIGHT NOW;;
for example, when i bougt tour to dubai, i used credit card because it was several days before payday and i didnt have enough money;;
but its enough for me, i dont want more;;
limit that my card offers me, is already fucking TOO MUCH for me, i dont need that much;;
and they still offer me loan here and there;;
yeahh, that's the economy today. If everyone wanted he money the have payed out. We would see a crash again, due to all the loans.;;
It's just one nice big fantasy we have;;
I have a hate hate relationship with credit cards;;
i got you <@343707181377388544>;;
there was a time when i had huge loans on credit card;;
after that i closed alll loans;;
and got new card last year only because i rented new appartment and needed money quickly;;
didnt want to wait for payday or anything like that;;
so i got new credit card and since then used it only such emergencies;;
I have had one since 99 with a big ass limit I literally keep put up and not in my wallet;;
The others I have I pay monthly and never pay interest;;
i dont pay interest too, but when you saying you pay monthly, you mean that before that you use them all the time?;;
because here in russia we mostly use debit cards, for all types of purchases;;
so no credit interest problems;;
I use one to pay bills then pay that card at the end of the month and yes some times I pay it twice a month;;
why dont just use debit card ?;;
because you dont have money at the moment when you need to pay bills?;;
Use the debit card on day to day stuff;;
I have had my debit card hacked before so I separated things and banks;;
thats good idea to separate hm;;
And not just one hack it's sad but even though you get money back eventually I just monitor it daily maybe it's made me alittle paranoid;;
yeah i understand that;;
"sometimes you have a lot of money on your card, and thinking like ""fuck, i dont want to lose it""";;
I wonder how a salesperson would react to being told I want to ha e the loan, but without interests. If he called me I guess I don't have the need for a loan.;;
just imagine a world, where if they call you, it's you who set the terms;;
haha;;
well you can have a lot of credit card money without interest;;
my interest-free period is at least 90 days i think;;
so its basically loan without interest;;
Depends on where you live I guess. I've never seen those;;
really?;;
you dont have interest-free period for credit cards in denmark? <@87241615671832576>;;
or is it very small?;;
I've not seen them;;
hm;;
whats an usual credit interest there?;;
how much percents?;;
between 9 and 25;;
haha here the same i tnink;;
But I usually stay clear of loans and credit cards, just because they don't do anything for me;;
well , maybe not 25 but 15-20, but still , nothing like 4-5;;
10 and more;;
yeah, while we speak, i closed credit card loan;;
and dont intend to have any credit money in the near future;;
i also have mortgage,but its for my parents appartment, so they pay it;;
Ahh and that's reasnoble;;
Morning everyone;;
morning <@287320205020102667>;;
How are ya;;
gooooooood;;
hbu;;
Tired lol;;
yeah i feel tired too already;;
since you guys were talking about credit cards and money and everything:;;
;;
If you have a credit card where you can pay the bill after a month with no interest, it's always worth it. Why? Because of inflation.;;
if you bought something for 5 euros, dollars, whatever on March 5th, but you're only paying for it on April 5th, those 5 euros/dollars are worth less than they were a month before.;;
;;
Of course it isnt an enoooormous difference, but you'd be surprised at how much of a difference it makes;;
also, good morning!;;
Or you use the Credit card to pre-order Anthem.;;
And after a month on release. Boom;;
Lol good morning  <@488734758847905803>;;
lmaaaao <@455797717763883009> please tellme you didnt do that;;

!info sixfootpanda;;
;;
same <@124294284978552833>;;
im no against sekiro in any way but i will tell  you whats personally turns me off about that game;;
for me theres almost no such thing as getting better in game. i usually just suck. probably thats why i love rpgs, where the most you fight, there more your in-game level, that at some point allows you to be almost god;;
sekiro, as i know, doesnt have any growing in game statistics, that will allow you to be better;;
only your own skill;;
fuck that i say;;
it does have growing statistics, no? dont you improve your weapons and stuff?;;
but yeah, you can't be a full scrub;;
I think that it doesn't but I can be wrong;;
hm;;
I know you can upgrade your arm with different abilities;;
Hm okay;;
Sekiro will have upgrades like most games of its type but of course will rely heavily on the player's skills.;;
Also good day everyone and welcome <@124294284978552833>;;
loool;;
See I love this;;
Thanks kellyd;;
suck it <@207416847019016202>;;
lmao;;
(this is healthy banter <@124294284978552833> );;
theres nothing healthy about <@488734758847905803>;;
just rotten piece of ex fruit;;
lol that's true too;;
Helloo peeps;;
I'm all about this too <@124294284978552833> , the one thing that impresses me more about Sekiro compare to games of its genre is the mobility and movement/control. Most games f this type have very stiff movement.;;
I witnessed the aftermath of last night lol;;
Fallen trees;;
etc;;
did belgium die?;;
Crooked lamp posts;;
Yes <@207416847019016202> we got wrecked by storms the last few days;;
Good to hear you're still alive and kicking <@!498246547838992414>;;
Yeah, thanks  <@348165887347523594>;;
I am alive for once;;
Discord seems to be acting up for me;;
it hates you?;;
Maybe lol;;
<@207416847019016202>  sometimes being god-like sucks;;
Like in Asssassin's Creed;;
not for me;;
never for me;;
i love all AC games;;
It depends for whom <@455797717763883009>;;
It get's boring, like you can just close your eyes and mash buttons;;
For me i mean üòõ;;
what gets boring? i only play games because of story and quests;;
gameplay usualy always boring for me;;
<@207416847019016202> , said many times that the less interactions there is, the better he likes it <@455797717763883009>;;
exactly <@348165887347523594>;;
i dont want to press buttons;;
give me cutscenes;;
btw i heard that days gone will have 6 hours of cutscenes. thats fucking awesome;;
The difficulty of figuring out how to take down a camp etc, gets boring. After a point you can just go in and kill everyone in front of you;;
Yeah, I'm excited for that;;
you can just go in and kill everyone in front of you;;
that is exactly what i want in every game from the very start;;
but i played odyssey on hard, so to be honest it was challenge all along;;
I'd like to strategise and takedown with some preplanning, and also getting caught and trying to get out of it. Gimme some challenge;;
Yeah Odyssey is super difficult on hard;;
I'd like to strategise and takedown with some preplanning;;
oh im really too dumb for that;;
I switched to Normal after 50%. So much to grind lol;;
really <@455797717763883009> ?;;
good to know. the other AC games i played were too easy even on hard;;
Yeah on hard its difficult. With level scaling on;;
This is very subjective. I like action games that require constant interaction  and skills. The story is important but gameplay is my main interest;;
Yeah, definitely differs from person to person;;
Yep;;
Now i'm rushing through Odyssey for the story;;
had enough of gameplay in the first 50%;;
This is what happens when a game is too long for me;;
"I get to a point where, ""damn I just need to get over with this""";;
Lol yeah;;
But if it's the only game you're gonna play. Then it's cool;;
Yeah true, it all depends. The past year though, I stayed away from open world games;;
I don't finish them anymore, most of the time, it bores the hell out of me before I get to the end. Well, big open world games. Smaller ones I can take;;
I like hub type of games now...like Mass effect use to be;;
Yeah, sometimes it's annoying to grind;;
hub games <@348165887347523594> ?;;
Yeah what's hub game;;
Sorry, that was the french dude speaking haha;;
<@488734758847905803>  your name just reminded me, I need to finish Alan Wake lol;;
lmao;;
I need to get it <@455797717763883009> - you can't buy it on the xbox digital store anymore because of the music license;;
What really?;;
Think I got the key with Quantum Break disc;;
Good day fine gentlemen!;;
all this Sekiro talk has got me hyped!;;
I think that hub is still the word for games like Mass effect <@488734758847905803> and <@455797717763883009>;;
I don't know how else to call it;;
hub world?;;
true <@455797717763883009> ;;
It's available on steam again, but not on xbox for now;;
Hub Worlds are worlds that connect different levels. Most often found in platforming games, the hub world can be considered the modern equivalent to the level select and map screens of old. Generally Hub worlds are based around one primary area, such as a castle or a town, however their are exceptions to this rule (For example see I-ninja.) While 3D games arguably popularized the format, it is by no means exclusive, 2D games with hubs also exist, such as Braid and Bubsy II.;;
Good day <@409836692158021632>;;
Gotcha <@348165887347523594>;;
Should be on Backcompat mango;;
You fokin dongles üòÖ;;
Such a fucking good game, <@488734758847905803>  gave me nightmares;;
yo <@409836692158021632>;;
yo <@455797717763883009> ;;
how are you?;;
hey hey <@348165887347523594>;;

guyyyyyyyyyyyys;;
I dont know what to stream;;
I think i'm gonna stream FFX;;
but I dont know;;
arggggg;;
Why not FFX? it should be alright;;
Or you do you have a game like Limbo or Inside. In doubt you could always play a simple game like that. Or cuphead;;
Stream what you like to play;;
If the game seems like a chore to you then you will not want to stream it either;;
haha I love Cuphead;;
Cuphead is maddening;;
true...it's torture <@275429891774742531>;;
its so pretty though, like that person you want to date but you know they are insane;;
hahahaha;;
that is the best description I've heard yet about Cuphead;;
<@409836692158021632> I love cuphead also...always a good choice when in doubt;;
my man <@348165887347523594>;;
I thought about playing cuphead on stream but it would just be a big fat saltmine;;
hahahaha;;
hahaha;;
an infinite salt factory;;
I'd do it though haha;;
I am waiting on The Division 2 to be playable tomorrow;;
Omg <@275429891774742531> that is so accurate about cup head;;

I have fully embraced my waffle;;
I am the waffle king;;

https://twitter.com/XboxGamePass/status/1105151403134205952?s=20;;
Dead chatt  <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
nope its not;;
im just trying to understand that twit;;
Apparently they have some cool Gamepass announcements for April;;
Because the GP twitter announced March games on 6th instead of 7th;;
hm;;
thats cool;;
Fix üëè gamepas üëè for üëè MS store;;
dno why I had to do that;;
haha;;
how youre today lands;;
doinggood, just preparing to do my homework;;
Haha Landsby;;
yeahh it's a hard one;;
In other news, Ubisoft Spring Sale is live now;;
Hm sadly I don't think I'm interested in any of their games;;
Not because of some principle, I'm just not;;
You might like WatchDogs;;
I played it, but for that I needed to go through hell to install english language there;;
And when I wanted to come back, I couldn't install english;;
lol, it sounds like my experience with Battlefield 3 üòÑ;;
it was in Russian because a friend of mine bought it for me üòÑ;;
Haha exactly;;
But it was hell to get a language I could understand;;
To be honest language restricted games is VERY rare case;;
and everytime they did an update I had to find the new files again;;
Only Ubisoft did it 2-3 times, and that's all;;
I think DICE are still doing it;;
Watch dogs, A.C. unity, A.C. syndicate, and i think that's all;;
But I've not had a battlefield game since 3;;
Dice doing it for text or for voice + text?;;
Ubisoft did it for voice + text, but for example as does it a lot but only for text;;
I can tolerate Russian text in games, even if I hate it;;
Text as I remember, I an't remember anything else than the game text was Cyrillic, so I had no chance of figuring what was what. and it didn't have a change language option;;
Yeah I got you;;
I understand that for you it's a big problem but I meant full translation;;
I can tolerate Russian text since I understand that;;
TRUE;;
I guess if I really did the effort I'd be able to read and understand a game main screen, but I didn't really want to do that at the time.;;
But there's a lot of sales on that page, it's a shame I don't have any moeny this month üòÉ;;
Haha;;
What from that page would interest you?;;
Maybe I missed some cool game of theirs;;
I've been thinking about Odyssey, but the anno series are the thing that really interests me right now;;
Hm;;
Anything strategy-like games is not for me;;
And I played all of AC;;
I get that. Ubi are mostly FPS games in some sort;;
The are?;;
What are their fps games aside from far cry?;;
Maybe shooters would have been more true. Ghost Recon, Siege, Watch Dogs, division;;
I do see they have steep, for honour, Trials and the crew. But except Trial I don't really think they are having a true focus on them at all;;
I might be wrong;;
I would name it action games;;
But I got what you mean;;
indeed üòÉ;;
What is actually you preferred game ganres?;;
Well you know some of them haha;;
I've discovered I am way more into the builders and puzzle genres than I actually thought;;
Even though shooters are still a big part of me;;
Good job <@!87241615671832576>, your dongle just grew to 15!;;
#NAME?;;
#NAME?;;
#NAME?;;
That's almost cover all my types of games;;
You can call some games of my list 1 puzzles, butt generally I'm not into puzzles;;
Ohh yeahh Adventure games are fun, I'd love to see more action Adventure games, but it would require I had a PS4 to try most of them;;
Anything like action adventures for me is list 3;;
List 1 is only for point and click descendants;;
https://store.steampowered.com/app/501790/Unforeseen_Incidents/;;
You might like this then <@207416847019016202>;;
Let me explain what I mean by point and click descendants.;;
For example, there is well known point and click called The Longest Journey.;;
"But second game, Dreamfall, wasn't point and click. And recent sequel, Dreamfall chapters, wasn't point and click either, but for me it's still one genre, which in Russian we refer as ""quest """;;
 <@87241615671832576>;;
Ahh okay, then point and click might be misleading compared to something adventure, which I guess that's what quest refers to as adventure just are a quest;;
"Is ""quest"" genre exists anywhere outside Russian language?";;
nope;;
I'd say we call them adventure games;;
and having a explanition in front;;
like Action Adventure would be something like Uncharted;;
Point and Click adventure would be Tsique;;
I might like it. Added to wishlist, thanks  <@455797717763883009>. But these days I'm not so much in any point and click, usually just in very intriguing ones, as Tsiouque, which lands tladviced me once;;
Yeah calling them adventures is very tough. I tried once to talk here about quest/adventures.;;
It was like:;;
#NAME?;;
#NAME?;;
#NAME?;;
- Nope!!!!;;
Something like tsioque can be called just point and click without any problems. But how would you call  Dreamfall, for example?  <@87241615671832576>;;
It's an adventure, but not anything like games everyone thought of when you saying adventure;;
well I guess people would call them RPG's which to me are the level above adventure games;;
I call games like witcher and me RPG, but when I say adventure, everyone thinks about them;;
adventure games does not contain all the RPG mechanics like talent tree, dialogue options and a sense of consequence;;
or at least it's my way to differentiate, as adventure games have a focus on the story;;
You're right, but still calling games like this adventure usually is very misleading for people;;
Indeed;;
So sadly it's not an option call Dreamfall just an adventure;;
"Because response will be something like ""oh, lile site in?""";;
Fuck autocorrect;;
"Response will be something like ""oh, like skyrim?""";;
I'd still call it a point and click adventure. You are looking through stuff and figuring stuff. Just like in Deponia;;
Yeah but there's no clicking;;
But Yeah, that's the best way to desribe;;
To people who don't play such games;;
Just to be sure, so the game picks up stuff by itself? or how do you interact with your surroundings?;;
You mean Dreamfall for example?;;
yes;;
okay, first let me explain what for me is generic pure point and click game (im sure you know that, but it can be helpful to someone else here):;;
"- you do not control your character directly in any way, by keyboard or gamepad. You cant press buttons that will tell your character ""go left,""go right"", ""jump"", ""punch"", ""pick up"" or something like that";;
- all interactions that you can do, you do with mouse. you click somewhere and character goes there. you click on something and character interact with that.;;
;;
Of course a lot of games keep these basic rules and add something else, what makes them not 100% pure point and clicks, but still those games are point and clicks for me.;;
There is a lot of examples of such games. Monkey Island, Full Throttle, The Longest Journey, Syberia, Deponia (one of new ones);;
;;
But sometimes sequels to some of these games (like new syberia or longest journey dreamfall) doesnt follow all those point and click mechanic.;;
;;
"The way you control your character in such games is VERY similar to witcher/me type games. Thats why i cant call it point and click and thats why a lot of people thinks about witcher when they hear something like ""adventure like dreamfall"".";;
;;
But all of the rest things in the game are not action or rpg in any way.;;
You cant fight, you dont have quest system, you dont have charecteristics and ability to upgrade them. ;;
Its basically all the same quest/adventure/point and click experience, but without pointing your mouse over something etc...;;
and one important thing - in pure point and clicks you dont control camera, its usually one view per location;;
So in Dreamfall you use your keyboard for moving the character and point and click you mouse to interact with things?;;
i dont remember if you can point and click, i think you cant;;
just interacting with something by pressing keyboard key;;
"and even if you can mouse click in dreamfall, theres also a lot of example ""almost point click games"", where you cant do it";;
"all adventure games made in RPG maker for me go to the same category, ""almost point clicks""";;
because there s no mouse in rpg maker games;;
Ahh okay, so it's a pure keyboard input;;
yeahh I get the confusion then. It's basically a point and click, but withthe wrong input;;
yeah;;
and it a lot closer to point and clicks than to rpgs;;
by the way it can have fights;;
but lets say that its not really fights;;
more like qte then in actions or fightings;;
Ahh okay;;
Sounds more like a Frankenstein monster syndrome.;;
thats why for me in russian its all quest adventures;;
It get it now;;
The thing is, i think walking simulator work more or less like that aswell.;;
come to think of it;;
yeah, but walking simulators usually doesnt have dialogues, whats for me is 80% of quest/adventures;;
dialogues and any other interactions with npc;;
because its usually without npc;;
that's agood point;;
thats the reason why i dont play walking simulators usually.;;
GIve me characters, dialogues, cutscenes, and all that;;
I really like what remains of Edith Finch. It did somethin more with the genre.;;
Different mechanics throught the story;;
well i didnt try it, and i dont whink i will;;
but who knows;;
I'd call it more like an interactive movie, without real choice. You are in it for the ride and a good story.;;
Oxenfree is FREE on Epic Store from March 21 - April 04;;
well 99% games that i mean by quest/adventures, dont have choice;;
i remember old blade runner game that had choice;;
oxenfree is cool, but i finished it <@455797717763883009>;;
Yeah so have I;;
all of the playthroughs?;;
Cool game, waiting for After Party;;
yup;;
Still have to go for slame ranger;;
Yea I just added it to my library lol;;
i played it one time;;
are different playthrough really so different?;;
for me, only games that i replay, are quantic dreams games, like heavy rain or detroit;;
"because first playthrough of that is usually ""what the fuck just happened, why did everybody die""";;
the games changes nature and explains it self way deeper;;
I've only played it twice though;;
well for me its not enough of answer to be honest;;
because for example in detorit, different playthrougs in the end feel like 2 different movies;;
Lol, the game has different outcomes depending on how you choose to talk to people;;
thats not exactly what im asking about <@455797717763883009>;;
You might end up being rude to someone and they react differently and in turn someone else might die;;
different outcomes can be not enough for replay;;
"yeah, all these ""he died, he lived"" is not enough to replay";;
for me;;
I doubt it is as intricate as Detroit;;
yeah;;
It's a 4 hour game;;
in detroit you missed huge chunks of game because of your decisions;;
Detroit is a full blown AAA game;;
amount of hours doesnt make any difference. game either worth of repeationg, or not;;
size and AAAty of game also doesnt matter;;
Think twice is okay with Oxenfree;;
wether game worth or not to replay, depends on deepness of choices;;
Once just to see how the others react, because you act like a different person;;
Exactly, choices;;
"because you know, in some games choice is just ""select one of 3 in the end"", and im not even talking about mass effect 3";;
What I gathered in Oxenfree was, after the first playthough I still did not understand what was going on and after the 2nd playthough they had explained more about what was going on. So it was basically first playthrough are the 1 chapter of the game and 2nd was 2nd chapter.;;
it was not like a david cage or telltale game, it was more pure and more refined;;
well to shorten up my question, i meant wether game give you some different locations based on your choices, or just different smal talks;;
Yeah you also uncover new details;;
I still did not understand what was going on and after the 2nd playthough they had explained more about what was going on;;
yeah i got you. but i personally wouldnt replay for that;;
a further explanation of what it going on.;;
Yeah nothing major;;
you have to look at it more like when you play a normal game. You have the first part of the game and you get a cliffhanger and then just stop playing;;
so you only played half the story;;
But if the story didn't hit I get it üòÉ;;
thats the point for me. i didnt feel like i played half of story in oxenfree;;
something happened, someone survived, okay, game over;;
"no huge pointers to ""game could have been entirely differeny""";;
i guess you didnt play detroit lands?;;
Nahh I didn't. I'd properly play it once and never get back, because the story did not seem to be that good;;
wow;;
really, wow;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
like this;;
for me that games are the best;;
haha;;
im not so much about quality of story, just give me more cutscenes;;
and real choices;;
Well all i saw from the playthroughs was a lot of references to all the normal tropes.;;
like racism and robots and rebellion to the master and so on so forth;;
well choice of settings and story dont make story bad;;
for me;;
i am impressed with the choisetree, which I'd call an innovation for the genre, so you are have an actual chance to find all possible endings.;;
if it's  story i've seen a million times before I am not that impressed to be honest-;;
Avatar was like that for me, it was beautiful, but a dull story to me;;
But there's always a first for everyone and I really hope Detroit are a first for someone as it's really good compared to the telltale games;;
i said it here a bunch of times, why i loved detroit choices so much, and why i think that was real choices, but i will repeat that...;;
Lets imagine, im in some location of game, and i have there really HUGE game turning decisions. Like, somebody will die and game will end that way for that characters.;;
"And when i made my choice, i thought like ""could i really choose other option, so game would ended differently, or is it just fake and everything still would end the same?""";;
And after that, i ask my brother, what he chosed in that location, and if it was a real choice.;;
And fuck, its turns out that my brother never was anything near that location at all, because story for him developed totally different;;
it is impressive and I won't deny that. But i am not personally impressed, as next time I play I'll only try to play it with the purpose of not get where I was before, because I want to see the other endings, which is fine. ;;
But does it flesh out the overall story of the game and does it make the whole world feel more living and do you connect more to you character?;;
I'd rather want new information all the time.;;
But Oxenfree and detroit also have some huge differnces in the scopes;;
But does it flesh out the overall story of the game and does it make the whole world feel more living and do you connect more to you characte;;
well im dumb and i dont need things like that often;;
Detroit are a part of the Cage iteration of making loads of choices impact the game. where Oxenfree goes for the time travelling mechanic to explore the phenomenon the main girl experiences;;
give me more cutscenes - its basically what i want most of the times;;
That's also a fair thing to want üòÉ;;
well not for everybody;;
a lot of people got boring watching cutscenes;;
I am not trying to be smart or say which is better. I just feel there's a huge difference in what the games want to deliver and I totally get why you prefer Detroit to Oxenfree üòÉ;;
yeah i understand that;;
Btw, did you play Yakuza 0? if you love cutscenes, there's a plethora of them. Even though they are very varied in quality;;
"but everytime somebody saying to me like ""story was not good"", im like ""dont know, dont care, story WAS there, dialogues were there, cutscenes were there, what else i could wish for";;
no, and i dont think that im ready to engage into yakuza series;;
I get that;;
and I get what you said about everything was there;;
and everything are subjective, just like people arguing about Donnie Darko;;
Which they should stop doing;;
they do haha?;;
i watched it 13-14 years ago and dont remember anything;;
Nahh it's just a weird movie, but some want to make it more than it is and other less than it is. and I am just indifferent.;;
Just like most games actually.;;
But right now I am not sure if I am all the way on the bandwagon of interactive movies, which Detroit basically are.;;
yeah it is interactive movies;;
i wish all games were interactive movies;;
I think I want to see something more than just plain entertainment.;;
so do you like the new tomb raider games?;;
first one was allright for me;;
then i played second, probably to a half;;
it was alright too;;
Ahh okay üòÉ I guess that's where my pain lies, I have not been able to complete any of them;;
I felt completely detatched from the game all the time;;
but for some reason stupid me thought that 3rd one will be massive breakthrough for the series, like witcher 3 was, and i wanted to finish 2nd and play 3rd, and even bought it. but then i realised that probably 3rd wasnt breakthrough in any way, so for now i dont want to play it;;
"'I felt completely detatched from the game all the time""";;
i understand that;;
Ohh yeahh, never think of how the witcher series evolved üòÑ;;
It's a unicorn;;
i can't even rember a good open world game before Witcher III;;
that's how impactfull it has been;;
good is very relative term;;
all fallout and tes games were good for me;;
but of course witcher 3 is exceptional;;
True, i was never impressed by Oblivion and I didn't play Skyrim because of it (+I didn't have the time), The way fallout looked always removed my interest.;;
so I didn't ever jump onto it and I still need to complete witcher;;
good morning mango bois and gurls;;
yeah i dont like the artwork in fallout games either tbh;;
but I heard such good things that i was willing to look past that;;
but then i started playing it and i couldnt look past it hahaha;;
haha;;
<@416803598173995018> - how is chicago?;;
also, <@207416847019016202> , how was LA noir yesterday?;;
is it the first time you played it?;;
It is not, but I didn't finish first time;;
same;;
i played for like 5 hours the firs t time;;
such a hard game;;
I like game. No challenge at all;;
Apparently you can fail a case, because I failed last one yesterday. But I don't care;;
yeah, i meant it's hard to not fail;;
But choices are stupid and not intuitive at all. That's why i don't care;;
yeah, i remember that some of the options weren't very good;;
You need to choose right option out of 3, but first, there s no sane distinction between them some times, so no explanation why your option was wrong, and second, reaction to wrong option is often stupid and doesn't explain anything;;
"You can call lie and present real prove that he's criminal, but game think that you should have call doubt, and criminal just respond like ""I don't care about your prove, you're stupid""";;
That's partly why I failed last case. I arrested apparently right guy, but pressed wrong buttons, so game concluded that case failed;;
Just because every time i chose wrong, criminals apparently weren't convinced;;
oh that sucsk;;
But since game doesn't require me to repeat missions, I'm okay with fails, just give me more cutscenes;;
"now that you mentioned it, i remember hitting ""Doubt"" and then he said something i didnt expect him to say (my character)";;
To be clear, all 3 responses are not expected at all. Lot of times face is clear, and that 80% mean that you should call truth. You call truth, and succeed, but your character actually says something agressive, as if like you called doubt or lie  <@488734758847905803>;;
So basically, you should not think about words at all;;
You need to guess by face and think if you have prove;;
If face is clear, call truth. If not, check proves. If you have one, call lie, if not - doubt. But don't try to anticipate what character will say;;
That's basically why I always think that any game mechanic usually doesn't seem very logical according to lore, story, and such;;
You will always find reasons to say that mechanics usage was not explained well;;
I agree completly <@207416847019016202>;;
now i'm remembering more of the reasons that made me stop playing;;
Hello all;;
Haha I made  <@488734758847905803> remember everything;;
lmao yeah;;
hey <@348165887347523594>  DEE;;
But those things doesn't bother me, I need story;;
Hey  <@348165887347523594>;;
How are you guys doing?;;
<@488734758847905803> not too bad. The talks we are sitting through are realllllllly boring but the events are fun. Getting to know a lot of people and meeting important people within the company so that‚Äôs nice. Haven‚Äôt been able to sight see at all, might be able to today a bit and possibly tomorrow;;
I'm doing well <@348165887347523594> ! hbu?;;
Hey <@348165887347523594> how‚Äôs things?;;
nice <@416803598173995018> ;;
sounds like a regular business trip lol;;
Lol yeah pretty much. Going out last night was fun, I‚Äôm tired today and we are just listening to the chief sales officer talk and talk and talk so I‚Äôm falling asleep;;
I'm pretty good boiis. Just got out of a long Wolfenstein 2 session. It's way longer than I would've thought;;
I feel you <@416803598173995018> , extremely bpring work meetings;;
Nice! Love that game. Yeah it‚Äôs really boring during the day but their events at night are a lot of fun;;
You missed yesterday all messing with mangos dead body on my stream  <@416803598173995018>;;
Lol oh too bad;;
*skyrim is the best game ever made*;;
*I don't care about your opinion or logic*;;
Someone talked shit about skyrim????? üëÄ;;
I think Lands did;;
Nooooooooooo!!!!;;
he didnt played it;;
*how can a person NOT play Skyrim?*;;
he just didnt like oblivion;;
easy <@!498246547838992414>;;
One my favorite game of all time for sure.;;
Not for me <@207416847019016202>;;
Same <@348165887347523594>;;
Well, everyone loves RDR2 and I could not even finish it lol;;
I'm not even buying it;;
I have zero interest;;
I tried, I really tried. This morning I tried going back to it...but the gameplay just pulls me off every time I do. Damn, what a shame;;
The gameplay looks fun, but I'm not into stories that last 6900000 hours;;
The story is fine to me;;
It's the freaking gameplay that bores the hell out of me;;
isnt skyrim the same? but with less cutscenes (which is worse haha);;
<@207416847019016202> is all about cutscenes haha;;
yes it is;;
Skyrim's gameplay has nothing to do with RDR2;;
my religion is cutscenology;;
Skyrim's main story isn't that good, but skyrim is great for the epic sidequests and characters;;
My religion is daedra worship;;
i didnt mean gameplay <@348165887347523594> ;;
crim just meantioned 59000 hours story;;
for me in that regard rdr and skyrim are the same;;
Skyrim's story isn't that long <@207416847019016202>;;
i still didnt finish main quest haha;;
i hope tes 6 will not be out for next 5-6 years, so i could finish that;;
Oof;;
I finished my first playthrough of the main questline in like a day;;
I'm more focused on gameplay I guess, but I love a good story. But how ever good the story may be, if the gameplay involves more chores then actually playing, it tends to bore me;;
more shores?;;
The clunkyness and the extremely slow gameplay of RDR2 just doesn't suit me.;;
I‚Äôm the same <@348165887347523594> I tried to get back into red dead but just can‚Äôt. I just don‚Äôt like it;;
I don't like endless cutscenes;;
If I'd want that, I'd watch a movie;;
*or mango*;;
I meant chores <@207416847019016202> , corrected it;;
<@416803598173995018> This morning I finally decided that I'm not going back to it. I feel bad about it cause I know it's a great game...But it's just not fun to me.;;
I think I agree with you <@!498246547838992414>;;
what kind of chores do you exactly mean? <@348165887347523594> ;;
if fishing, hunting and stuff, then i didnt do it for example;;
lmao <@!498246547838992414>;;
Or FFX apparently;;
damn is that game slow;;
in the beginning;;
Hello <@488734758847905803>;;
how are you do?;;
dude*;;
foking auto correct;;
I *are* doing good;;
XD;;
lmao;;
I good am doing yes;;
That good being;;
Well, I hated the movement, the controls, they have pushed realistic gaming to an extent that every single thing felt tedious to me. I hated that it was so slow and clunky. It's just not what I'm aiming for when I game. I just want to start the game and have fun. I need a decent story though, but gameplay and fun is a priority. I like when my mind is completely focused on the game. When there is too much waiting, watching and less actual gameplay, I just can't <@207416847019016202>;;
I definitely agree <@348165887347523594>;;
<@!498246547838992414> how do you feel about kingdom come?;;
I understand that all <@348165887347523594> ;;
it doesnt surprise me;;
"i just didnt get that part about ""story full of chores"" haha";;
I've been too busy to get really invested in it <@488734758847905803> but from what I saw, I like the world and how immersive it is, the amount of cutscenes are good for me, the gameplay takes some getting used to, especially the combat, but I like it, despite how clunky it can be, the graphics are good, but overall I like the game, even though I've been too busy to properly get invested in the world and it's characters;;
i liked kingdom come a lot, but there was a story sequence in the middle, that kinda forced you to stay in the closed building, turning off open world for a while. And even though i got out of there, it turned me off a lot, so its now year since im trying to return to that game;;
Hurry guys put up a chart with cutscene to gameplay ratio and compare it to gold.;;
That sucks, I promised myself that I would not take breaks from a game anymore. I usually never find the necessary motivation to get through the learning curve again;;
true that <@!498246547838992414> - I was thinking about getting it, but only if the story was good;;
lmao <@87241615671832576>;;
oh... how long were you stuck in the building <@207416847019016202>;;
?;;
Same <@348165887347523594> I tried again but I just can‚Äôt get into it;;
alright third times the charm...;;
went from MG10XUF to. MG12XU;;
I got the 12 yesterday and they gave me a used broken mixer.;;
had to go today and get a new one...;;
oh damn <@111826600395378688> that sucks;;
hope it works now;;
nice setup btw;;
thanks it works wonders atm man.  <@488734758847905803>;;
niiiice;;
glad to hear;;
tech issues are soooo frustrating;;
plug and play for the most part;;
the one I got yesterday was scuffed af;;
all the audio came out as a sound effect;;
Blame all tech issues on <@278571432588345345> <@111826600395378688>;;
so everything sounded like it was in a hallway and there was no way around it;;
lawl <@498246547838992414>;;
welp now I gotta figure out the proper way of buying a firearm from my grandfather...;;
what did I do now lol;;
haha;;
<@278571432588345345> you spread your curse to those around us;;
superstitious fucks! xD;;
fix your shit hahaha;;
hahahah;;
but <@!498246547838992414> - <@278571432588345345> actually fixes the curse. But he has to help you;;
otherwise it doesnt work;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> `Fix yo shit!`;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
"in kingdom come deliverance you got stuck in that ""buildng"" for, i think, 30-60 minutes of straight gameplay, if you know what you do <@488734758847905803>";;
I need a mango to fall from this mango tree;;
Afternoon awesome people;;
hey <@508094590436507668>;;
how are you;;
Good man;;
I had a rough week last week, but much better now;;
thats good;;
Agreed;;
Oh damn <@207416847019016202>;;
Hahaha hey <@508094590436507668> what's up? Hope everything is good now;;
<@537319907541516311> , post that link in <#494741950575149056> next time :);;
What‚Äôs up @everyone;;
hey <@448648678224429068> !!;;
what up dude?;;
Not much bro what about you;;
just cooking up  some surprises for the community;;
O nice I‚Äôm going to announce my retirement from streaming tonight;;
why?;;
you just got the laptop to start streaming with a capture card;;
It still isn‚Äôt working;;
foook;;
but that's still just a matter of returning your laptop or getting a new one or something;;
doesnt mean you have to quit streaming;;
I can‚Äôt afford a new one and can‚Äôt return this one dude I have been streaming for almost a year and only have had 3 people total subscribe to my channel and it only lasted a month;;
Ho damn, I'm sorry to hear this <@448648678224429068> . But can't you just keep doing it just for fun?;;
I mean, when you'll get a new laptop;;
I really don‚Äôt get any enjoyment out of it the way it‚Äôs been. If I had more viewers it would make it better but the only person that is loyal to my stream is <@524820041976250368>;;
In this case, fallow your instinct bro. I haven't been here long enough. But I totally understand how it must feel.;;
<@409836692158021632> thanks for stopping by my stream and chatting appreciate it;;
I will keep trying but I don‚Äôt know how much longer <@348165887347523594>;;
Hey guys, I'm about to make my first youtube video, any advice on stuff like structure, editing, things to avoid, etc.?;;
<@448648678224429068> no worries, dude! I'll stop by again next time!;;
<@250095777509146624> what's your video gonna be about?;;
It's going to be a review of Spellbreak that will lead into a short series on the mechanics of the game and tips in other videos;;
oh nice!;;
Yeahüòä;;
<@448648678224429068> I absolutely love your streams! I may not get to be at all of them but things will get better! I for sure have your back and support you alwaysüíú;;
Morning everyone;;
I just had a vivid picture of the Mango para drop GIF with huge sound and then it zooms out and we see a mango drop 3 feet from a tree in real time;;
morning <@87241615671832576>;;
you think we need to throw <@488734758847905803> from a tree?;;
he has a parasuit;;
we will mess with it;;
Buongiorno fellas üêº;;
morning panda;;
<a:hotcoffee:537944974160035861>;;
wow thats some spicy coffee;;
<@488734758847905803> no problem darling.;;
Maxican Coffee, the one that'll give you cold sweat for days;;
Caffe Tabasco;;
Btw guys, wtf is happening with Brexit ?;;
Well I'd say they are kind of like me when I have to deliver homework;;
Lmao;;
I have no clue, it seems so incompetent all over the line;;
What I understood is that they're gonna have a no-deal Brexit this month end.;;
Or has it been postponed?;;
I guess they are going for a postponement, none is interested in a no-deal Brexit. BUT all of the people in their parliament have no attachment to to the real world, so they think they can have all of the benefits of being it the EU and none of the downsides;;
Zzz. Politicians;;
I feel bad for the future generation who'll have to study this shitstorm for their history exams;;
i think every generation has enough of a shitstorm in history lessons to study <@455797717763883009>;;
not hust future one;;
I suppose, but this is just confusing;;
We just had to learn about colonisation, killing, war etc;;
<@448648678224429068> sorry I can't make it to more of your streams, they are just at a weird time for me, but I will try to stop by more often;;
Yo  <@498246547838992414>;;
Heyoo  <@455797717763883009>;;
Got ideas for emotes?;;
I've done some random stuff;;
waffle themed;;
Ooo nice;;
Try a waffle face;;
I posted a few in  <#512649569595555860>;;
While I was at it I made myself a cartoon character, he is now my pfp;;
Now I'm trying to give him a fitting body;;
Nice. Love the angry waffle dab;;
It is fitting for me;;
Because I'm always annoyed and dabbing;;
Lol;;
Make the beer frothyy;;
That one I just made for fun;;
I probably won't use that one;;
Or a waffle dipped in a mug of beer;;
Beer sauna;;
Only for waffles;;
Ooooh, good Idea <@455797717763883009>;;
1st I wanna do my character to see if I have enough skill for a humanoid person;;
https://www.artstation.com/artwork/KRJ29;;
Could be a reference;;
Daaaamn;;
That one is great;;
Yeah, I could do a semi reallistic one;;
Yeah, which program do you use?;;
Photoshop;;
But I made all them things on my phone at like 1am;;
Check out Autodesk Sketchbook;;
Because I couldn't sleep lol;;
Damn, on the phone? Lol;;
I'm terrible, I know;;
I can't sleep anymore;;
I got like 5 hrs sleep in the past 3 days;;
Insomnia? Or just work?;;
No, maybe 7;;
Work;;
I've been sleeping 7 hours a day;;
And yesterday I had this bastard of a headache, so rip me yesterday;;
I need at least 9;;
Oof <@455797717763883009>;;
Yeah I'm a lazy panda;;
I can run off of 7-8;;
Haha;;
Do a sleeping waffles;;
With them Zzzzs;;
But I don't drink coffee or energy drinks because fok that shit;;
Oof, that could be cool as well;;
I have like 2 coffees a day;;
Morning and evening;;
If I don't use one as my twitch emote, I'll just use them in my discord;;
Yeah or just make a gif out of it  lol;;
I'm not an animator lol;;
wow;;
7 hours sleep is almost too much for me;;
<@498246547838992414> it's easy to do. You just need few frames done on Photoshop;;
I can teach you;;
Thanks <@455797717763883009>;;

Mangos go sploosh when you drop them on hard floors;;
Waffles survive;;

FROM THE WIND;;
mangos good resistant;;

Waffles are pancakes with abs, mangos are wannabe apples;;

Exactly;;
Best way to make your dongle larger than others - cut off others;;

I'm a warehouse manager <@488734758847905803>;;

I'm doing well except for the shitty power outage that happened during the stream;;
Hey dude!! How are you?! <@488734758847905803>;;
I'm doing good, hbu? <@541966272561283082> ;;

<@488734758847905803> busy! Good but busy! I‚Äôm thankful, but yes pretty busy and I‚Äôm so happy I finally received my loyalty badges! *dance*;;
Good job <@!541966272561283082>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
niiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!! <@541966272561283082>;;
What‚Äôs up mangos! Congrats <@207416847019016202> on your creation;;
yo yo <@287320205020102667> !;;
Hyello <@287320205020102667>;;
How‚Äôs you upstanding gentleman doing?;;
I'm fine my  man. Just woke up from an extended nap. Sucks cause it's now 10pm lol;;
How are you ?;;
I‚Äôm stuffed just finished eating;;
haha, that feeling. Noice. I just had some fried fish myself. And it was damn good;;
I have combination fried rice and a sushi roll;;
Niiiice;;
Sushi roll;;
Me lovey;;
I need to play some games and chill;;
I looooove sushi rolls more than patting my dongle.;;
Looks like I'm in for a long night. I may try streaming Ryse son of Rome later.;;
RYSE;;
RYYYYOOOOOSE;;
I loved that game  <@348165887347523594>;;
Because there a a lot of cutscenes of course;;
Hi  <@287320205020102667>, Thanks!;;
Yeah, a great cinematic experience.;;
Exactly;;
The gameplay is quite repetitive and simplistic but I think that it is still very fun;;
I agree;;
Ideal Orange formula for game;;
Yep lol, I have no doubt this game suits you;;
I'll either stream it later on this morning(in about 4 hours or so), or this evening around 20:00;;
Your time?;;
Yes, around 6:00(in 4 hours) this morning, or 20:00 this coming evening;;
Hm;;
Both times suck for me but I'll try in 4 hours;;
You're 7 hours ahead of me right?;;
Yeah;;
Yeah, hard to find  a good time for everyone;;
Maybe 17:00?;;
or 16:30;;
sorry missed message <@348165887347523594>;;
yeah it would be beter for me;;
i love that you changed twitch name and set up pic;;
haha i love kellys clips;;
morning;;
morning <@87241615671832576>;;
Morning everyone;;
morning Nerdyheart üòÉ;;
How‚Äôre you? <@87241615671832576>;;
I am great üòÉ;;
morning nerdy! <@524820041976250368>;;
just had  my laugh of the day with the ALDI TeaTime Takedown;;
Where they want parents to sign up their kids to be killed in games;;
without actually knowing how games work;;
That‚Äôs great to hear! <@87241615671832576> and how‚Äôre you? <@207416847019016202>;;
Im great <@524820041976250368>;;
cant wait to continue streaming LA Noir  tonight;;
Have you solved any crimeS?;;
what do you mean?;;
isn't about solving crimes?;;
exactly;;
about solving;;
not about failing to solve;;
you can fail, but its not easy;;
so yeah, i solved most of them;;
Haha I love watching you play that game! <@207416847019016202>;;
Ahh that's a shame üòÉ;;
But as long as you like the game it's good üòÑ;;
and decision system in this game very dumb by the way;;
i like it because of cutscenes <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
thanks <@524820041976250368>;;
No problem!;;
Yeahh everyone has been complaining about that decision system since release;;
because its honestly dumb;;
no, not even dumb;;
its just makes NO sense;;
I understand it, there's no correlation between what you decide and what he then says?;;
yeah, thats one of the reasons;;
i talked about it other day, let me find message;;
I think I read it;;
https://discordapp.com/channels/488838692698587138/488838692698587140/555037038064435230;;
yeah;;
yeahh i read that one;;
"i didnt make it clear then, you always have 3 choices called ""truth, doubt and lie""";;
its exactly how they are called;;
and theres a lot of situations when npc said something simple, and you need to respond, but he didnt say anything that you could consider as a lie or truth;;
he just said something;;
nothing important;;
"so you think ""okay, guess ill call truth""";;
"and after that your character start agressively screaming something (which you didnt expect), and npc just respond with ""fuck off"", and you now - you failed this conversation";;
but it didnt make sense;;
basicaly, you have 3 choices, and fuck logic and complexity of the story, theres no grey area, theres only ONE right choice;;
yeahh that's what I meant about no correlation;;
and if you call a lie, you alsoo need to choose right evidence, and theres only ONE right choice;;
its kinda random guessing game;;
yeah i know, i just wanted to describe more things that i didnt mention last time;;
Are we talking about LA Noire?;;
Also morning fellas üêº;;
yes <@455797717763883009>;;
morning;;
morning panda;;
I just watched this game ;;
https://store.steampowered.com/app/784150/Workers__Resources_Soviet_Republic/;;
hahahaha;;
I kind of fell in love with it;;
in moscow we got a lot of old styled tramways like that on the left;;
ohh;;
I am definitely going to have a look at this. But maybe not before the early access review has shown if the game is worth anything;;
i have to make stake in early acces right now;;
Funny thing, i think i didnt buy any full priced game since odyssey. and by full price i mean russian steam full price, which is 30 bucks;;
not because of some principles or lack of money, its just nothing full priced come out, that would interest me;;
mornin guys!;;
hey <@524820041976250368> are you still traveling?;;
hey <@87241615671832576> , <@207416847019016202> and <@455797717763883009>;;
did anybody here play ghost of a tale?;;
i didnt, let me googlesteam it;;
it looks really cool;;
looks nice, but sadly i will kill myself if i will play stealth;;
lol stealth is coolio;;
i love when game has cool stealth BUT allows you to fail stealth and after that fight;;
its totally up to you that way;;
fight can be too tough so its better to go stealth;;
its up to you;;
like in dishonored;;
right;;
"but some games are like ""someboy noticed you? GAME OVER BITCH""";;
I love stealth personally.;;
I got the no kills, never seen trophy in dishonored 1;;
"and what piss me of more in some games, after you will succeed strict stealth seqence, story will be like ""Okay, but now you got noticed, so now you can fight""";;
But tell me, why i couldnt fight before???;;
https://youtu.be/TcMBFSGVi1c;;
yeah <@207416847019016202> - they force you in a cutscene. I also dont like that;;
haha i was gonna mention that it happens usually in cutscene <@488734758847905803>;;
but decided not to overuse that word too much;;
lol <@207416847019016202>;;
<@455797717763883009> , i feel like this movie is going to be darker than the others, and therefore, i shall watch it;;
Yeah looks like it;;
<@488734758847905803> yes I‚Äôm in Arkansas should be headed back to Texas tomorrow I think üòÇ;;
how has it been there <@524820041976250368> ?;;
<@524820041976250368>  can you drive by brasil on your way home and punch <@488734758847905803> just for no reason?;;
It‚Äôs been good! Other than dealing with some other stuff. Haha. <@488734758847905803>;;
<@207416847019016202> I‚Äôm no where near him but if I was I got youüòÇ;;
your american geography doesnt concern me. change your route a little and drive by brasil;;
Haha I‚Äôm not the one drivingüòÇ;;
"after you will get there, youll find the right place easily. just ask anyone ""to hit mango"", and they will point you. its a big touristic place.";;
Haha;;
Hahaha;;
There's a charge now, 5 dollars for one punch;;
can i pay with bits?;;
i got bits for 2.5 punches;;
Sure;;
Haha;;
does tier 3 subscription has BDSM perks?;;
or do you need to be partner for that;;
Lmao;;
Tier 3 subscription lets you to spit in my face;;
i can do it without subscription <@488734758847905803>;;
Nah;;
Gotta pay me to do that;;
no im not. come closer;;
hahaa i think i'll pass;;
Have y‚Äôall ever went diamond digging? <@488734758847905803> <@207416847019016202>;;
whats that exactly?;;
diamond digging <@524820041976250368> ?;;
i have not;;
Yeah digging for actual  diamonds;;
I thought that was an activity exclusively reserved for poor countries exploited by the UK;;
Oh haha I don‚Äôt know but they have it here in Arkansas that‚Äôs what we are doing today!;;
nice!;;
make a grill for your teeth;;
wow thats cool <@524820041976250368>;;
how do you guys feel if a streamer starts streaming a game he had already started off stream?;;
like, i played nioh last year for about 15 hours;;
I dont want to restartit;;
It's totally okay because even if you start from beginning, a lot of people will come in in the middle  <@488734758847905803>;;
Omg! üòÇ <@488734758847905803> and yes! <@207416847019016202>;;
that's true <@207416847019016202> , good point;;
thanks <@524820041976250368> üòÉ;;
Morning everyone!;;
yo rolling <@287320205020102667>;;
I can‚Äôt get my pics from Chicago to upload here. Stupid discord, might just be cause I‚Äôm on the app;;
yeah, photos and the app don't mix well <@416803598173995018>;;
glad to hear your plane didnt crash;;
I‚Äôll try later from my laptop;;
Lol yeah me too;;
hahaha;;
no kidding;;
how was the trip overall my dude?;;
I mean lots of planes are crashing so it‚Äôs fair lol. They grounded all the ones with issues. It was fun! Just wish I could have gotten out more to see the city but I saw wrigley field the last day so that was enough for me;;
wait, what?;;
a lot of planes are crashing?;;
what/who is wrigley field?;;
Morning  <@287320205020102667>  <@416803598173995018>;;
I once couldn't send screen shot of my screen I'm discord, and it was because picture has link  <@416803598173995018>;;
Literally, link was on picture, and when I drew all over it, message sended;;
So it can be content of photo;;
hm;;
damn russian photos;;
It was actually twitch link in screenshot;;
hm;;
Hyello all;;
Ahh ok <@207416847019016202> I‚Äôll have to figure it out. Hey <@348165887347523594>;;
You're back home <@416803598173995018> ?;;
I remember  <@416803598173995018> promised Thursday stream;;
Hey  <@348165887347523594>;;
I agree with  <@207416847019016202> , <@488734758847905803> . To me it doesn't matter if you started it before. Plus, Nioh is very long and I don't think a people would care to watch the entire game lol.;;
But seriously, I don't think it matters much;;
lmao  <@348165887347523594> , are you traumatized?;;
by the game i mena;;
Maybe haha. I enjoyed the time I spent playing it though;;
Just that I feel that there is a lot to learn to get back into it and I will not restart this damn game;;
right i gotcha;;
And, it's dark, very dark...I'm not really into dark games right now.;;
I'd watch it, but re-playing it is another story;;
Man, so many people playing the division 2 right now. It's very tempting to get it.;;
<@348165887347523594> yeah back home. <@207416847019016202> I know I said that but it‚Äôs not happening lol. I got in so late and am going into work later so I have a lot to catch up on;;
feelzbad <@416803598173995018>;;

Never heard of it;;

I'm persistent;;
I am as well <@488734758847905803> that's why I had the earrapes in my stream for so long;;
lol;;
I took them out because I wanted death after every stream;;
lmao;;
I cann imagine;;

I thought it was funny at first;;
There is a Dutch streamer who does the same;;

Hahaha I'll give you that;;
hahaha;;
thats cause you didnt see the metro stream too much I think;;
that game had me tilting like a motherfucker;;
Oh yeah;;
That spot where you kept dying without ammo lol;;
yeah omgggg;;
I thought I was gonna lose the save;;
Not streaming today. Just gonna surf other streams and liven up chats with your charming personality. LoL. Gonna stream tomorrow tho.;;
I had no filters and no ammo;;
lol <@509529130593681410> cool!;;
What are you streaming tomorrow then? do you know?;;
cause I dont know what to stream today lol;;
Well...I'm gonna practice some Rocket League with another streamer cuz I've never played it before and I might start with that. But Ik definitely streaming DBD in the evening. That's my every Friday thing. üôÇ;;
cool!;;
Do you get tilted easily?;;
cause I don't, and rocket league tilts the shit out of me;;
I get so mad at that game;;
<@488734758847905803> stream cuphead lol;;
lmaaao;;
I suck so bad at that game;;
I could never;;
Ahaaha;;
Just do the run and gun;;
Or the tutorial lol;;
I got as far as the roller coaster on my bro-in-law's pc;;
I'm stuck there too üòÇ;;
Fucking Aladdin;;
lmao;;
that shit is tough;;
who here said it is the dark souls of platformers?;;
It's the mother of Dark Souls;;
I don't get tilted too easily...but we'll see. RL might be the game to do! Haha;;
lol <@455797717763883009> ;;
it is pretty hard, and it looks so cool. the art is so amazing. it makes you want to suffer;;
lol <@509529130593681410> , i think it will haha. I will def have to stop by your stream tomorrow and check it out;;
to see the rage happen in real time;;
Yeah, that candy shop woman ripped my balls and handed it to me;;
https://tenor.com/view/cuphead-flower-gif-10044706;;
lmaaao;;
I remember the carrot boss and stuff too;;
And the blue condom head;;
<@509529130593681410> Oooohh I *love* Rocket league, I streamed it a lot lol;;
I sucked though;;
Yeah and I suck at most games in general. LoL. I'm a personality type streamer that loves games, but will never wow you with my skill! Having said that...with the right people I still enjoy games that are pretty tough for me. So let's see if I don't throw my PC out the window tomorrow!;;
Good job <@!509529130593681410>, your dongle just grew to 2!;;
I'm a personality streamer without a personality;;
XD;;
But I'm the same  <@509529130593681410> I enjoy the game a lot eventhough I'm very bad at the game;;
Good morning, afternoon, evening everyone!;;
OMG...Cuphead talk! ‚ù§ it!;;
<@498246547838992414> Exactly! I play and have fun...or play and find out I don't like it and don't play again. Haha. But I'm chatty and some people like hanging out with me. üòâ;;
nice starting screen <@509529130593681410> üòÉ;;
was checking out your channel now;;
<@278571432588345345> Aw thanks dude! I do that too. Go check out people's clips and VODs. Great way to discover new content. Friday nights are my most popular nights. And I stream VR, but need to fix some stuff before I can stream it again. So that probably won't be until next week. Flat games this weekend. üòâ;;
awesome! what's the next VR game you're doing?;;
I'm always checking other people's stream to see what folks are doing you know;;
trying to find things to incorporate into my own show;;
Well...if I can get them to stream right...The Forest and Contractors in VR. Horror survival and FPS. Streaming takes on a new dimension of problems. Things that need to be tweaked. Especially when updates to games break stuff. VR on PC is very unforgiving with that when it comes to streaming. And I'm not a big tech person. So I always have to get help.;;
<@278571432588345345> is the best tech person (when he's not cursing people) <@509529130593681410>;;
lol;;
<@509529130593681410> I used openVR for streaming, so I can see chat in my view when I look to the side. How did you approach the chat thing in VR?;;
I curse people and then help them solve their problems <@!498246547838992414>;;
the ultimate strat;;
If you start charging people, you'd be a millionaire in a few months lol <@278571432588345345>;;
hahaha;;
<@278571432588345345> I use Ovrdrop for chat. But recently there's something that's changed or maybe has changed with the games. Idk. But I'm having problems and its stalled me playing certain games in VR. üòî;;
I'm also a personality type streamer <@509529130593681410> ;;
If I had to rely on skill I'd be fucked;;
That's actually exactly what @jonny does;;
Curses them then helps them;;
Nioh, kingdom hearts or final fantasy 10, guys?;;
Mango needs help with his annoying indecisiveness!;;
kingdom ‚ù§ 's pls;;
KH when I want to feel happy!;;

Hey guys!;;
Sorry, had a bit of a family emergency, so I had to deal with that for a sec. It was nothing too serious, but it required my attention. Will do a longer stream to make up for it;;
I hope everything is ok <@488734758847905803> ‚ù§;;
it is <@409836692158021632> thanks üòÉ;;

okay, no problem;;
my bot has very simple text related functionality, so i had no problems at all with it;;

never tried it, but as i know it has bunch of similarities to java;;
im just looking up youtube turtorials;;
yeah sometimes its a good way;;
the first thing i ever coded was in notepad;;
i put a little too much hot  coco mix in my hot coco and it just hit me;;
wait orange i have a question;;
java or javascript;;
i wrote bot in javascript;;
i just mentioned java because i  know it a lot better since i use it for work;;

hey <@348165887347523594>;;
Sup <@207416847019016202>;;
I missed your stream.;;
haha you did;;
You're hosting someone that doesn't speak at all lol;;
yep, i choosed him for the game, didnt know if he speaks or not;;
haha;;
all of people who i follow didnt stream;;
Ho alright;;
Slow day;;
not for me haha;;
its evening already;;
So, did you get the spectator experience thing on twitch?;;
i saw that notification;;
just clicked it off;;
what the fuck is that?;;
Me too lol. Sounds fishy haha;;
do you think its exclusive to that guy stream?;;
I don't know. Le me try another channel;;
Notification whaaaa?;;
It's not doing it on other channels;;
What is going on?;;
Go on <@207416847019016202> 's channel <@!498246547838992414>;;
and youll be the first one who will read that message haha;;
lmao;;
Do you get the notification <@!498246547838992414> ?;;
I didn't get any notifications;;
Damn, this is weird;;
sp00ky;;
crim was there probably when i raided;;
maybe he hided it before;;
Lurking;;
This feels like someone is trying to insert an anal probe in me.;;
You get that a lot? <@348165887347523594>;;
It's my first...but I better get use to it approaching my 40s;;
Oof;;
After 40, anal probe is a thing;;
40s?;;
You look like 25;;
Lets hope it lasts;;
Yeah hahah;;
Are you really not getting the spectator notification <@!498246547838992414> ?;;
Are you on pc or phone?;;
phone;;
probably thats why;;
probably;;
Yes;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAqoEDiWQCA;;
<@207416847019016202> , why is your profile still showing that you're streaming?;;
HHHHHYYYYYEEEELLLO!!!!;;
I feel so lonely here;;
üôÅ;;
i didnt press stop on OBS;;
thanks for mentioning;;
You're welcome üòâ;;
i recorded game menu for no reason for 2 hours haha;;
forgot to end it;;
LMAO;;
Now you can make a menu review;;
when you raid, you need to rurn off obs manually;;
menu review?;;
You have enough menu material to do a whole review about the game menu only;;
haha got it;;
agreed;;
lol;;
2 hours is a lot;;
Do you locally record your streams?;;
yeah;;
and store it;;
i bought 6tb hdd in december, so its no problem;;
all my streams only 268 gb so far;;
ok;;
I was thinking about recording my last stream, but when I heard my own voice, I was like naaaanhhh man;;
I can't stand hearing my own voice. The fact that people don't ask me to shut the hell up every time I open my mouth to speak is beyond me.;;
dude, its not related to your voice in any way;;
everyone thinks that their own voice is kinda strange;;
its natural;;
so its nothing bad about your voice;;
You're being nice. I would love you even if you weren't üòÖ;;
But I know what you're saying lol.;;
The first time I heard my voice, I was shocked;;
your voice is okay as of 99% people;;
theres only 1 of 100 with terrible voice;;
haha;;
Hey guys!;;
Hey <@329001373670572044>;;
I'm still eating and stuff here at the beach haha;;
Will probably be home in about 12 hours;;
hallo mango;;
How are you my friend?;;
i am good playing some games;;
Enjoy your day <@488734758847905803>;;
Nice!;;
Thanks <@348165887347523594> ! You too;;
Thanks üòâ;;
you was offline for so long i hoped you didnt survive the beach <@488734758847905803>;;
lmao;;
Lol <@207416847019016202> , don't worry, I'll be there later;;
I know you were afraid;;
waait... <@488734758847905803> You're alive!?!?!?!;;
*the assassin didn't do his job*;;
did you use belgian ones again? <@!498246547838992414>;;
told you go with russian ones;;
Yeah, I should've listened;;
should have gone with the russian ones;;
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/15/experience-i-wear-purple-every-day;;
Is that <@488734758847905803> ?;;
haha;;
lmao;;
It's funny but I like what he is wearing. He got swag;;
I didn't think purple could look so cool;;
yeah, you would not even guess that looking at <@488734758847905803>;;
hahaha;;
Slow day on discord. Good evening/night all;;
Hello <@348165887347523594>;;

are you ready for the exam? gangsta;;
Hell naw;;
I'm half prepared;;
Now that's a real gangsta;;
Yeah;;
I was busy enjoying myself;;

Being prepared is for pussies;;
And we know we can't have this down in this b;;
You guys are great examples;;
GANGSTA FO LOOOIIIIIFE;;
Mango, Orange and now you have all said fok school lmao;;
lmao;;
I'm responsible dammit;;
You should look up to us;;
Definitely;;
I think mango died;;
He is probably sleeping now after a long day at the beach;;
Yes;;
Also, mango is hiding something from us;;
How does his face look so young while I look like I'm 69 and have been smoking for 60 years;;
You look pretty young on your profile picture hehe;;
wow;;
gg <@348165887347523594>;;
lol;;
You don't look very friendly though;;
I made myself as accurate as possible to myself in real life;;
That is actually how I look;;
Damn, that is one scary smile;;
That's where I had to improvise;;
Because I don't smile irl;;
ok lol;;
scooby dooby doo;;
Good job <@!417075583692963840>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
Heya <@348165887347523594> ;;
Dont worry about your voice! You sound good, my dude! ;;
And like what <@207416847019016202> said, it's all in your head. ;;
üòÅ;;
haha, thanks my dude <@409836692158021632>;;
You got this, <@348165887347523594> ! ;;
I suffer from this as well (not liking my voice) üò™;;
But I honestly love your streams, your reactions and your commentary so please keep it going!;;
Morning everyone;;
How are you all?;;
Hello <@87241615671832576> , I'm good buddy. I hope you're doing good üòâ;;
Doing great, just woke up and are dragging the kids to kindergarten. Afterwards I have an assignment I need to make and hopefully I'll have some time to look at yesterday's stream;;
Morning  <@348165887347523594> and  <@87241615671832576>;;
Ok good luck with everything my man. Trying to find some sleep here. But sleep is a no show right now;;
Morning <@207416847019016202>;;
What  youre playing now  <@87241615671832576>?;;
I played Lastday of June yesterday <@207416847019016202>;;
But I am not sure what the next one would be.;;
yeah i saw your tweet, should check it out;;
If you look at the first 5 -10 min of my VOD you'll get a pretty impresion of it;;
It's a narrative driven third person puzzle game. Some would call it a walking simulator with a dash of puzzle to it;;
But I liked it, the story was also quite good. It was pleasant surprise as Tqsouge was ot how you spell it?;;
That game - It's biggest hurdle are it's name, I wonder what the writer was thinking;;
Tsioque i think;;
you are right that's the way to spell it;;
<:DrinkPurple:414729535339102208>;;
sup mangoes;;
I'll be doing a coop stream with Rejaku, singdeath and <@207416847019016202> tomorrow! Covering Satisfactory;;
super excited;;
the streamer of the weak joins us for shits n giggles;;
shniggles;;
Just remember to pet the doggo;;
yeah im excited too;;
one thing i loved about the games was. the game has a TO DO list, with resource requirements it's like sorcery in these types of games;;
NOICE!;;
whos there;;
*dabs*;;
Sup mangos;;

I don't take orders from oranges..;;
Orangebot just gave me 69 notifications;;
Why? <@417075583692963840>;;
69..perfect number;;
Because I have school today;;

hm how about to teach orangebot to dm dick pics to people;;
I have exams this week yeeet;;
I have exams next month;;
So fuck my life;;
Rip;;
*yeet*;;

Do it!!!;;
I wan't to do !dickpic;;
Then orangebot sends me a dickpic;;
you enter !dickpic 25, and it choose 25 cm dongle and send it to you;;
YES;;
Orangebot has a dick?;;
Umm... yes <@417075583692963840>;;
A dongle;;

Nice<:purple114Top:556843878355959827>;;
Orangebot will replace mango;;
It's 6:47am;;
I have an hour and 20 minutes before school;;
I just finished;;
It's 12:48;;
Did you do as planned <@!498246547838992414> , going to those exams unprepared like a real balls of steel gangsta;;
Hell yeah, it actually went really well  <@348165887347523594>;;

üò•;;
#BelgianMasterrace;;
I couldn't be more proud of you <@!498246547838992414>;;
i could;;
I wish my dad said that sometimes üò≠  <@348165887347523594>;;
lol;;
Same;;
i wish <@348165887347523594> was your dad <@!498246547838992414>;;
lmao;;
Yes;;
I'd be your dad <@!498246547838992414> , but you'd have to wear the eyepatch;;
I wish I had a dad;;
I'm down to do that <@348165887347523594>;;
Did he leave for the gas station? <@417075583692963840>;;
Yeah;;
He said it will take 10 minutes;;
It's been 10 years;;
wow i know what kind of merch <@348165887347523594> should do.;;
eyepatches!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;;
Eyepatches with dongles on them!!!!;;
Dongles with eyepatches;;
eyepatch with working compass on it;;
Also an option <@417075583692963840>;;
Oof;;
Mango looks a bit like a compass;;
Do you ever just want death;;
yes;;
I am forced to watch this dinosaur show;;
Oooh;;
I like that;;
<@207416847019016202> Yeah, that's an idea man, eyepatch merch with dongles designs;;
Dispatches in the shape of dongles;;
*EYEPATCH;;
I hate typing on my phone;;
Phones = death <@417075583692963840>;;
and you should have option to make eyepatch with dongle designed as your real dongle;;
or if you are girl, dongle of closest friend;;
The stegosaurus has big spikes;;
The velociraptor has big claws;;
We are the dinosaurs;;
Help;;
And what if your dongle fell off because a certain <@524820041976250368> and <@409836692158021632> both beat you at having a bigger dongle? <@207416847019016202>;;
mangosaur has a small dongle;;
1cm;;
hahahahahaha;;
they cant beat me <@!498246547838992414>;;
Where's my bathtub and toaster?;;
I have a toaster;;
And bathtub;;
<@!498246547838992414> doesnt have those things;;
belgium is too poor;;
I only have waffles;;
oi <@207416847019016202> belgium is one of the richest countries;;
then wheres your toaster;;
In my closet;;
I always felt uneasy about bathtubs;;
And soon in my tub;;
When I take a bath with it;;
Waffles just aren't that valuable;;
Because my dongle is tiny;;
lol;;
Waffles are valuable;;
For ME;;
Pancakes>facts;;
Facts>waffles;;
waffles > anything else;;
Therefore pancakes>Waffles;;
wow thats some hardcore mathematic shit going on here;;
I'm  *o f f e n d e d*;;

omg you again;;
hi <@488734758847905803>;;
Hello <@488734758847905803> , I thought you forgot your dongle at the beach and drove back to get it;;
mango travel brasil so much, you would think he would be killed by now, but no....;;
no point to go back, <@348165887347523594> ;;
you cant find dongle so small in the sand;;
lol...but it's purple, it should stand out.;;
its buried under the sand... too small...;;
Hey all;;
heya <@416803598173995018> chan;;
Hello <@416803598173995018>;;
well i guess I went all Japanese;;
Hey <@87241615671832576> and <@348165887347523594> how you both doing?;;
lol <@87241615671832576>;;
Doing great üòÉ How are you?;;
I'm good buddy, how you been <@416803598173995018>;;
hey <@416803598173995018>;;
Been ok <@348165887347523594> I have been feeling really out of it the past few days. I have no motivation and don't feel like myself, not sure why. Hey <@207416847019016202> how are you?;;
sorry but im as always awesome <@416803598173995018>;;
Take care of yourself <@416803598173995018> , and take your time.;;
lol I wish I could be awesome right now. I wanna stream later but I have a lot to do, might not be able to until wednesday at this point;;
<@348165887347523594> nothing even really wrong, I have been busy but I just feel off. No clue why;;
"I know the feeling bro, in french we call this ""Un moment a plat"". Just not feeling right. I get like this sometimes.";;
But me is usually sign of depression. Cause I'm that kind of person.;;
yeah thats what I was thinking too. I usually get that way sometimes too, Ill snap out of it soon;;
Got a lot to do today and tomorrow but I will be back streaming on Wednesday for sure. I gotta finish last of us!;;
No problem bro. We'll be right here when you're ready.;;
something terrible has happened in Chicago apparently;;
lol that trip definitely threw me off I think. Coming back to work on a Thursday threw my mind off and I definitely got sick from people on the plane. I had a great weekend though, I didnt feel good but I literally just played apex the entire weekend lol. I wish I could just play games all day long, every day. That would be a dream!;;
it would be for me too;;
in last week i played games only on streams;;
I do love streaming, I really need to get back to it. I just love video games so much, this weekend was the most fun I have had in awhile. I think I played 17 hours total of apex between Friday and Saturday lol;;
I feel like streaming more cuphead or Ryse...but in the same time, I feel lazy lol;;
Cuphead, would kick my ass for sure though;;
we gotta get back on apex again too! lol that was so fun that day you, me and mango played;;
maybe we could try for wednesday?;;
yeah cuphead looks very difficult;;
True, I'm all for it <@416803598173995018>;;
It is extremely difficult;;
lol fun to watch you get frustrated though haha;;
üòÇ I bet it is;;

Ohh didn't know, I can never really tell if it's a good week. I am going to explore the Discord Nitro games,  just because it's a cheap buy in and I can't afford all the games I want to play.;;
I gotcha;;

Lmao;;

For <@526319824704634881> ;;
Cuphead receipts üòÇ;;
sending photo evidence ? lol;;
haha ;;
fine! I'll set up Twitch on my Xbox...;;
we want a gameplay <@409836692158021632>;;
hahahahahha;;
ok... I gotchu!;;
üòÇ;;
YEY!;;
i call photoshop;;
hahahaha;;
that's not even your account;;
we know mark is good with painting;;
ok, I'll play it on xbox;;
but it'll be no mic, no chat unfortunately;;
"yeah, and i dont see ""weak american"" in the name";;
hahaha;;
you got me, <@207416847019016202>;;
no mic, no chat, no proof its mark;;
hahaha;;
jeez...fine....;;
mic + chat for proofs;;
thats better;;
im not disappointed now;;
haha;;
thank goodness;;
tried to play Forgotton Anne;;
no mic??;;
that game is too cool for me, so i want to play it on stream after LA;;
no point waste it off stream;;
<@526319824704634881> I'll get the mic and chat set up;;
the Xbox is in the bedroom and my wife uses it for Netflix and Hulu;;
that's why I don't stream on it;;
i guess she doesnt know it can be used for games;;
otherwise mark would not get approval to buy it;;
they play games on it! they have Kingdom Hearts and stuff;;
If it's too much of a hassle to set up, you don't have to.;;
nah it'll be fun. I haven't tried streaming on the Xbox yet!;;

It's a little quiet now <@557380058566623233> coz most of the peepz are asleep.. the chat is almost always active when I'm asleep.. hehehe..;;
<@526319824704634881> normal when people are from everywhere in a group lol;;
I guess is daytime where you are <@526319824704634881>;;
"<@524820041976250368>.. I'm doing good, didn't sleep well last night and accidental nap happened in front of my pc while ""working"".. lol.. good thing there were no emails from clients.. I just woke up actually when I sent my first msg here.. üòÇ";;
I'm from the philippines..so I'm basically way ahead of everyone... Where are you from <@557380058566623233> ?;;
Oh right!.. we have a very useful bot here made by <@207416847019016202> !!;;

Hey <@405560388504125471> !! How are you?;;
Chilling just finished streaming clash royale;;
Lots of fun;;
Hahahhaha!! It was so traumatizing that your brain probably erased the memory <@557380058566623233>;;
Lol yes! <@526319824704634881>;;
No worries <@526319824704634881> It was just a test stream on the Xbox.;;
Not sleeping yet? ;;
Also, Feel free to check the different sub channels under The Mango Tree <@557380058566623233> .. ;;
I actually joined, I think just last month, so I'm still learing discord too.. feel free to ask anything..;;
Oh sorry to miss your stream <@405560388504125471>.. did you post it on live now?;;
<@526319824704634881> thank you! Yes I was looking through them early. I should be going to bed really lol;;
Omg <@409836692158021632> !! How many tries did it take you?!;;
I'm tagging <@278571432588345345> so he'll know you're here. ;;
Looooook Hooman! <@557380058566623233> is here!;;
Oh that info stuff is cool <@526319824704634881> is a way to have everything in one go;;
<@526319824704634881> I did a few practice runs before streaming it üòÇ;;
"Yes.. I am pro sleep.. so sleep while it's still ""early"".. Good night <@557380058566623233> ! Thanks for joining us..I want to invite you to The Fort too but idk how.. hooman! Help..";;
"Ooohhh! How ""few"" are these test runs?..";;
Hahahaha thanks <@526319824704634881>  have a good rest of your day yourself!;;
Haha...I was practicing for about 10 mins so maybe 4 or 5 test runs;;
You did practice runs to say all the curse words before streaming didn't you?! Didn't you <@409836692158021632> ?!;;
üòÇ  I couldn't practice the curse words coz my daughter was watching me play.;;
Thanks. Sweetdreams <@557380058566623233> .. I still want to take a nap tbh.. lol..;;
Lol;;
Hahahhahaha! So that's the secret on how not to curse!!;;
You could just curse in Pinoy and she wouldn't know! Lol;;
Goodnite <@557380058566623233>;;
It can be super super frustrating. I can only play it for 45 mins max because it caused so much stress.;;
And that's why I would never play that game ever...;;
But I strongly think that <@207416847019016202> should try and play it.. <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Haha that would be an amazing stream to watch!;;
Morning everyone;;
What game are we talking about <@409836692158021632> ?;;
cuphead <@87241615671832576>;;
And everything is good again <@526319824704634881> I am just a bit annoyed about that blue screen of death;;
Ahh good O'l cuphead. I bring it up at times;;
i see tuesday med set has more social pills...;;
<@526319824704634881> didnt speak so much in her life;;
ill never play it, its really stupid;;
lands, did you played thumbleweed park? i think you mentioned it;;
Well I wouldn't reckon it's for you. As far as I understand you are more into the narrative of a game;;
And yes I played a bit;;
I still need to finish it;;
"not ""more"", ""only"". i dont like even repeat fight once or twice in a game, not speaking about 270";;
i started thumbleweed park yesterday, since i want to save Forgotton Anne for streams;;
i like it, its very old style point and click;;
nobody these days does that lucas arts 80s games;;
It is and the logic seems to be okay and not to obscure;;
But it is very good;;
thats good;;
"i literally never seen games with all that 10 ""pull/push/use"" options since lucas arts old games";;
thats what really brings up old times, not that jumping cup shit;;
Lol;;
Both games are good, but they are in the different end if the spectre. Thimbleweed park are like playing chess, while cuphead are more like checkers. One is more about thinking and analysing, the other more reactionary and based on intuition and reactions.;;
sorry lands, but that comparison is bad for me;;
very bad;;
chess and checkers are very similar games;;
and since chess considered as sports, these games are like chess and tennis;;
Yeahh I know, I shouldn't have brought in the games at all. Just used the keywords, which was the important stuff;;
And everything could be considered a sport if there's some sort of competition in it;;
That's great that the death screen is now gone <@87241615671832576> ! i had the worst timing earlier.. hehe;;
I'm actually almost maxed out of my monthy social interaction <@207416847019016202>. So I'm going back to my dark corner now and hide..;;
Social plan for February haha;;
I foked up at work.. sheit..I feel bad..;;
Is that bad for you and your work?  <@526319824704634881>;;
What happened Pokat0?;;
Yep..filipino workers online are easily replacable.. sooo.. I need to focus on work more this week..;;
I wasn't sleeping well for the past days so accidental nap happened earlier.. and I missed something important..;;
Ohh :/ I am sorry to hear.;;
Yeah that's bad;;
I'm fixing it tomorrow hopefully.. yeah.. need to focus on work this week..;;
Shit it's <@557380058566623233> !;;
I worked in call center once, and turned off phone for whole night cause of tooth ache;;
Lol <@207416847019016202> .. did yoh got fired?;;
She's asleep now <@278571432588345345>.. invite her to The Fort.. idk how.. hehhehe;;
No, I was very valuable there. But my boss was disappointed and spoke to me  <@526319824704634881>;;
But yeahh, do the focus if the work. Livelihood are the most important;;
It's she?  <@526319824704634881>;;
Invite to the Fort sounds a bit rapy;;
Fortress of Basiltude;;
Lol, it's a very furry fort;;
Now furry fort sounds wrong.. lol;;
Good job <@!526319824704634881>, your dongle just grew to 12!;;
Wooohoo dongle growth!;;
Furry fort sound awesome;;
Little angry Filipino with huge dongle sounds dangerous;;
Forgot to mention meds;;
I hate my meds so much..it messes with my sleep and energy.. I will obsess about this mistake for days..;;
"Hahahhaha..""filipino dongle""";;
Filipino potato dongle;;
Filipino dongle conversion rate is 1.5, so it's actually 18 level dongle;;
Lmao;;
Wireless potato dongle you say?;;
Wireless dongle usually called strapon;;
Hello dongles;;
Hey crim  <@498246547838992414>;;
Hey <@207416847019016202>;;
I'm at school;;
I'm freezing to death;;
Good job <@!498246547838992414>, your dongle just grew to 20!;;
Hells yeah;;
Haha, another dongle;;
*LEVEL 20 DONGLE*;;
I hope there's insurance;;

Hello;;
Henlo  <@87241615671832576>;;
Did they forget to turn on the heat?;;
I'm outside;;
I'm dying here;;
Did anyone hear Mango's glorious singing from Yesterday??;;
My ears still hurt;;
lol, I thought it was awesome haha;;
Yeah, I really loved yesterday;;
If there s no clip, then it wasn't awesome;;
I just hate that I was so tired I could  barely keep my eyes open(my eye hehe);;
I didn't see it, I slept;;
It should 2 times easier for you to keep eye open  <@348165887347523594>;;
Lol, it was great, just watch the vod back;;
lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
That's why I was able to stay up this long my friend lol;;
Haha;;
Didn't mango screaming the lyrics to living on a prayer wake you up?;;
I had not slept since Saturday;;
And yeah, the shouting kept me up for a while;;
hahaha;;
I went to bed at like 3;;
And woke up at 6;;
Exams yeeeet;;
wuuut wuuuut, gangsta mode exams. Should be good;;
Heh I hope my gangsta-ness gives me good grades;;
It should, if not, smack the hell out of the exam and tell it that you know where it lives. It should work;;
Good Idea <@348165887347523594>;;
Damn <@498246547838992414>! Exams?!;;
"I'll ""shank his nan""";;
If you will fails you always can create gang... infamous Belgian waffle game  <@498246547838992414>;;
Gang;;
Fucking correct;;
Yeah <@526319824704634881> and also a very good idea <@207416847019016202>;;
Belgian waffle gang;;
#wafflegang;;
My inner asian is having a panic attack hearing the word exam..;;
Oh noes;;
I'm great;;
Does exam means something nasty in Asian?  <@526319824704634881>;;
I have studied a bit (3 hours);;
You will own this shit <@!498246547838992414> , I trust you;;
Hell yeah;;
It could mean something medical <@207416847019016202> haha;;
I guess in most Asian countries exam are equally how you life the rest of your life?;;
At least in Japan and South Korea;;
Ho damn;;
Medical exam Haha, exactly  <@348165887347523594>;;
Damn;;
Life time exam, 24/24, 7/7;;
And I just want the world to be like a game. Fail is acceptable and work is fun;;
Yeah, that would be really cool <@87241615671832576>;;
Fail IS acceptable in life.  <@87241615671832576>;;
Until you're dead haha;;
That's true, but that's a game over.;;
Good job <@!87241615671832576>, your dongle just grew to 16!;;
I totally agree <@87241615671832576>;;
Gamer over is the ultimate fail though;;
And most jobs are basically a gameplay loop, just a shitty one :);;
Exams are anxiety inducing for me.. coz we have to be perfect all the time..coz asian culture/pressure..;;
But I believe <@498246547838992414> !!! You own that exam!! Rek it!!!;;
Are you perfect?  <@526319824704634881>;;
That's the thing, exams strife for perfection in a world where it does not  exist;;
Exactly <@87241615671832576> !;;
Hell yeah <@526319824704634881>, thanks!!!!;;
Working for Sprint was just like playing cuphead on a daily basis <@87241615671832576>;;
No I'm not perfect <@207416847019016202> ...that's why I have high anxiety.. lol;;
I gave up on that real life stream though;;
Lol @kelly;;
Does that means you're bad Asian? <@526319824704634881>;;
Yes orange.. I'm a rotten asian potato..;;
Let's make the game if life then;;
Btw.. when will we play Pummel Party <@87241615671832576> and <@348165887347523594> ?!!;;
We need to plan this for real üòÉ;;
True we do;;
I have to deliver the kids to kindergarten now;;
lmao, bad asian... not asian enough  <@526319824704634881> ;;
btw, i watch youtube of some russian guy who lived in japan for several years, and was married to japanese girl. and he always going like 'never marry japanese/asians'.;;
and he explained it like because of all that strong rules asians dont take europeans seriously, and for japanese wife european husband will always be not worthy.;;
is it how it works in whoretown?;;
<@207416847019016202> join us! I think you'll like this game.. I heard friendships end because of this game..so it's right up your alley.. hehehhe;;
Damn, maybe that dude is being over negative <@207416847019016202>;;
Yes! We need to plan this!!;;
Oh okay <@87241615671832576> !! Take care!;;
Cause I've seen videos about some black dudes living in Japan and it has been mostly positive <@207416847019016202>;;
maybe he is <@348165887347523594> ;;
but he lived there for several years and i didnt;;
also he said that a lot of his friends experienced same problems;;
Idk what videos you're watching orange.. but I nowadays it's not that strict anymore..;;
For sure, but I think that some people just love the dramatization of stuff  and make it sound worst <@207416847019016202>;;
i didnt say its strict oficially;;
I know that there are still asian families who are very traditional still so maybe that's why..;;
And maybe that the videos I've watch, they were actually being way to positive lol;;
so, you <@526319824704634881>  would tolerate, lets say, french husband, who is weak enough not to be able to beat cuphead?;;
I know some asian families don't allow their children to mix marry..;;
lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
Hahahhahah;;
i wasnt clear enough apparently... i didnt mean strict open rules that forbid something, and families that follow them. i meant more thet after ages of that rules it can be kinda inserted in your consience, that man who is not surrounded with these rules, is not worthy enough;;
"There are asian ""standards"" that men/husbands have to be in certain cultures/families.. I'm not saying all.. so maybe that guy in he video was a part of..";;
I would gladly accept a french husband who won't ever beat cuphead <@207416847019016202>;;
"okay, still i wasnt clear enough... i didnt mean ""have to be in certain cultures/families""";;
i meant more inner prejudices;;
"Oh I see.. yeah.. when you live in a family with all these rules in life and ""asian"" standards to live up to then yes..he can feel unworthy..";;
yes, that what i meant!;;
when you have some standarts to keep up to (anything, any of us have some strandarts), then person who doesnt match that standarts, sooner or later will be not enough for you;;
I have always heard that Japanese people are taking work and productivity to a certain extreme. But it may also be a question of perspective. Like if you don't care this much, it won't bother you. Like those videos I've seen of Afro Americans living in Japan. They all really enjoy it and have no issues dating Japanese. But then, those people already came out from a particular background being Afro-Americans and all. So maybe the perspective is different cause they kind of expected it to be worst. I don't know. But the overall impression I had was that it wasn't as nearly as bad as some people tend to say it is.;;
<@526319824704634881> ok ok lol, this convo is making me very shy lol . (it should be fine haha);;
Hahahah.. no worries... i'll delete the message.. hahahahah;;
well that guy explicitly said that dating is fine, marrying is when all bad comes out;;
im not saying he is right though;;
I see;;
Marrying will always bring bad shits anyway;;
I see what you mean <@207416847019016202> .. yeah.. dating and marriage are different for some asian cultures..;;
My family is mixed culture and my mother always complains about it. I have never heard my father complain about shit cause he doesn't give a damn what his step family thinks about him.;;
Coz in marriage the pressure is greater coz of the influence of the parents.. and guys are pressured to have this high responsibility and standard..;;
But then again..it's less common now a days..;;
Sorry to make you shy <@348165887347523594>;;
<@207416847019016202> check this game out! We need more players... And it's on sale.. ;;
https://store.steampowered.com/app/880940/Pummel_Party/;;
Sale ends in 9 hours;;
Martinicans are very proud people, feeling like privileged blacks(compare to other places)  and act sometimes like whinny brats , but I can tell you that if my mother couldn't take her familly's pressure, my father would 've left a long time ago. It's a matter of perspective. He does not care. Sometimes, I say fok the step family if they think we ain't up to the task.;;
<@348165887347523594> mixed culture is difficult coz you don't know which standards to live by..;;
True <@526319824704634881>;;
"Having the ability ""not to care"" has it's advantages and disadvantages..";;
That also...but I think that not caring is the better option. Those who don't care seem to be happier;;
"Hhmmmm... ""seem to be happier""....";;
i checked out Pummel Party;;
4 bucks for me now;;
will buy it;;
good morning;;
its funny how <@526319824704634881>  being bad asian turned out in this huge conversation;;
morning <@329001373670572044>;;
hallo <@207416847019016202>;;
Morning <@329001373670572044>;;
Yeah!!! Pummel party!!!!;;
hallo <@348165887347523594>;;
Ikr! My horrible example caused a deep conversation.. so weird..;;
speaking about different standarts... im the same at some things. if im very good at something, and somebody is worse, i look down on them and hate them for not having as high standards as mine... though it mainly applies to work;;
Hey yo! <@329001373670572044> !;;
hallo <@526319824704634881>;;
I have very high standards for myself and very low for others lol;;
well you know sometimes to be good at something you need to be hard on yourself. and then you see other people not being hard on themselves, and being bad... i kinda despise it;;
what bothers me that people around them also are not hard on them, but supportive for no reason;;
Same <@348165887347523594>;;
hhhmm, to each is own bro. I personally will never despise this and support especially those who have a hard time pushing there selves to higher standards;;
Lol.. are you sure that your standards are only for work <@207416847019016202> ?;;
Those who are able to do it on there own don't need my support;;
So no point for me to support them;;
i have not much things aside from work, so its mainly work <@526319824704634881> ;;
but it can be other things;;
I support only the weaker at a certain point...when they don't need it anymore, I move on to the needy;;
to be clear, its totally alright to be bad at something. im not agains it. but if person doesnt improve over the time, and i see its because they dont have same standarts, its when hate starts;;
also if person complain about it at the same time;;
I agree with you on this point. I will support those who want to get better. If there attitude shows no real will to improve, I'm out <@207416847019016202>;;
100% agree;;
Yes.. we can't be all good at all things.. so of course we'll be bad at certain things.. and also.. I agree with kelly..to each is own.. your standards maybe bot the same as my standards but that doesn't mean that person is not trying hard enough..;;
Agree with the complaining thingy tho;;
Coz if you complain and not change your ways there will never be improvement and you'll be stuck at where you don't want to be..;;
‚ÄúThe¬†definition of insanity is doing the same thing¬†over and over again, but expecting different results‚Äù.;;
is it from meds instruction? <@526319824704634881>;;
"Lol no <@207416847019016202>... Meds instructions are ""Do not operate heavy machinery while taking this medication""";;
so no dongles?;;
Some people just want the help whatsoever and never even make the effort to improve. But it's complicated. Lots of time there is a wound, or a scar at the root of there attitude that refrain them from making the move. Some, just aren't worth your time as a regular human being and should be dealt with by a professional that knows what he/she's doing.  Some people are traumatized from whatever event that has happen in there lives . Makes them incapable of doing things that seem very easy to other. Like just cleaning your room your house. It's like lifting up a mountain to them;;
Personally I am not annoyed by people complaining and not improving IF none has told them made the efford to adress the issue. At times you problems can be so close to you, that you litteraly can't see them;;
why someone had to tell them to make effort? isnt that spoon feeding?;;
Not making an effort;;
Telling them what their problems is;;
no one is obliged to them to tell;;
I've seen way to many nag about other people and when you confronted them with the issue, they had no clue in the world;;
so that's what I meant by, you probklems can be se close you don't see them and thus you can't really improve, because you don't know it;;
or you are to ignorant to know;;
look at Trump üòâ;;
I have been incapable for years after my accident, and was living in filth cause I just could not find the drive to get my shit back together. I could not cross over a desert street on a Sunday for no reasons. I had to get help. People made fun of me and said lots of bad things. But I found the help.;;
Sorry couln't resist;;
i understand that. but im not going to walk around giving people free advice;;
to some people - yes of course;;
I do get that. i am not going to leap mountains to help people I don't know;;
I am soley talking about people which are in the vacinity of my social life;;
Some are not worth the effort and some are just clueless till you say: hey, maybe it's time to have a shower and people want to talk to you again.;;
The key to me is the attitude, if they are like: Fuck off, I can't help them I am leave them stinky, but other times they take that shower and actually enrich your own life;;
yeah;;
"Agreed. Everyone deserve the help though, even the ones that are like ""fuck off"". But not everyone can help those";;
It's why there are professionals for that;;
"im in ""discord api"" server, for bot coding purposes. and  you will not believe how much people there having that attitude like ""hey, dont try to explain me, just write code for me please""";;
Screw these people lol;;
Sounds awful and that's the people I throw out like it was trash;;
yep;;
If you want code written - DO it yourself - with that attitude;;
"its more like ""dont try to make advices so i would get what i do wrong, just show me where my error is""";;
yup, that's ignorance in the wild;;
Agree Lands;;
to be honest its not even in my book to ask for help;;
is its at work and somebody knows better - then of course;;
but all my home projects and such i always did alone, without anyone knowing it, so i had no one to ask, and get used to solve problems on my own;;
Good for you <@207416847019016202>;;
Everything is good for me, you dont have to mention that haha;;
But again..you should also consider that not everyone is alike.. not everyone is wired the same.;;
i consider that.. so what?;;
That's all.. hehehe;;
i just meant that even ask for help is strange for me, but demand it is more stranger;;
when i joined that discord i expected more essential api info there, buut most of that discord is people asking for help with their code;;
and often they would solve it by themselves, just if they spend couple more hours with it;;
Asking for help and demanding help are totally different..;;
I see what you mean..;;
I'm getting a little tired now.. I might nap a little or just sleep very very early tonight..;;
"really, i ead those messages, and im like ""wow, why would you ask that, you should have just spent more time and you would solve that""";;
Idk what's going through their head <@207416847019016202> .. some people need verbal reassurance and some just need attention.. you'll never know..;;
If it bugs you so much just leave that discord channel..;;
it doesnt bug me, i just speak out what strange for me;;
"it doesnt have anything with ""verbal reassurance"", its just lazyness";;
instead of spend more time on that, you go asking for help;;
"i say that because answers to that problems usually are very simple. like ""you have typo there""";;
fuck. he could have find typo by himself;;
i remember, mrs orange once did some project for her study, electron js + python, and at some point there was huge error, we coulndt understand reason for 3-4 hours.;;
"After that she decided to ask about it on forum, and i was like ""ok, but i never ask qustions, becuase i usually will solve it faster then somebody will answer""";;
"Mrs orange was like ""no, its not the case, we stuck here""";;
She ask that on forum, and we fucking solve it in by ourselves in an hour;;
thats why im very surprised why anyone would ask for help when its just some kind of typo;;
Coz sometimes you need your mind to think about other things first.. it's like stepping back and looking at the bigger picture then you come back and see what's wrong...;;
But again.. this only applies to people who are their to improve themselves and not plain users..;;
I agree, some time you need a break;;
But after break you still can  do it by yourself;;
Hey, I finished the exam;;
Went horribly yahyeeeet;;
Also, should I buy pummel party? It looked fun when abssii played It;;
You may buy it;;
I allow;;
*okay*;;
You have to. The orange has commanded youto;;
*Orange commands me*;;
*I am his servant*;;
*Glory to Orange*;;
yes;;
lock up your mangos, orange glory is everywhere;;
*destroy every mango in sight*;;
You're done with the exam <@498246547838992414> ?! Legend!!!;;
Yeah!! Let's play pummel!!!;;
Yeah you should buy it for sure <@!498246547838992414>;;
How many players does it allow?;;
Ehh, It didn't go too great <@526319824704634881> but I finished and I think I passed;;
I will buy it <@348165887347523594>;;
Because orange *commanded me*;;
Yey!;;
*yeet*;;
up to 4 I think;;
good;;
how many people we have already?;;
Yo fellow dongles;;
hey panda;;
Yo orange <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
lol;;
sorry that orange, it kills me every time;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
henlo <@455797717763883009>;;
Heya Crim;;
How are the emotes coming up?;;
Good good;;
I'm still very busy studying at the moment;;
Are you making emotes aswel?;;
aka ramming my face into my book untill  I memorise it all;;
Yeah, For myself  <@87241615671832576>;;
Ahh;;
Because I am cheap and don't want to pay a professional;;
lol;;
Cheapsedate;;
And i understand that one <@!498246547838992414> I do the same currently. just trying to memorize and not really think;;
I prefer slutbollocks but okay <@455797717763883009>;;
To be fair, if you create some really good ones, people would probably pay for them aswel;;
See, that's the issue;;
"What classifies as ""good""";;
true, to me I'd love either funny/surprising like <:Orange:545555843978887170> or cute <:rooHappy:292269838145945600> <a:rooFiretruck3:525265145530810383>;;
Hmm, yeah;;
I just make them for myself because then there are no expectations;;
But it's also subjective as I've never really liked pictures like <:Kappa:365857187299590145> or <:Jebaited:522771339493244978>;;
But again, they are quite limited to the a certain area of the internet;;
so as long as you like them I think everyone will like them üòâ;;
My emote style is kinda like <:Orange:545555843978887170>  and <:PM:539114910211112995>;;
Ahh i guess I'd actually like it then;;
But I'm waaayy off marklar's level of skill;;
if you manage to complete them after bashing the head through a book üòÑ;;
XD;;
I have a few ready;;
okay, where can I look at them btw ?;;
Hold on, 2 sec;;
;;
Here are a few;;
The gold thing will probably be my sub badge;;
Cool, I get some rayman vibes from them actually;;
Ahh;;
I remember him;;
yeahh, arms or legs, just hands and feet;;
Yeah;;
I'll probably just use the ones without feet;;
Feet annoy me;;
yeahh they seem strongest;;
just do the floaty thing with arms maybe?;;
or hands;;
But I want a dab emotr;;
Emote*;;
And arms are needed for an excellent dab;;
TRUE;;
one thing I can figure is, what the head is.;;
it looks a bit like a cookie and it's not to offend, i just don't have a reference in my head for it;;
"A waffle, because ""hahahaa I'm Belgian so I must be a waffle""";;
Hahah, it's okay <@87241615671832576> you were close;;
ahh of course;;
*this is very clever, I know*;;
When people call me waffle guy more than crims, my theme was basically made for me;;
Yeahh, well if I had to something i'd have to do something Viking related, BUT everyone are doing Vikings;;
and I guess Diabetes medicine are not that well recieved;;
or Legos would end in a cease and dismisss;;
Hmm... yeah;;
But waffle guy does sound fun;;
and most f the time I guess it's important to go with the flow of you community;;
I don't even eat waffles all that much lmao;;
But yeah, I agree;;
Embracing the joke;;
just like the Dongle;;
*even if I hate it's existence*;;
Yeah, the dongle was great;;
<:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840> <:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840> <:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840> <:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840>;;
dongles are not a joke though;;
Now we just need a <:Orange:545555843978887170> and <:Emote_MANGOJUMPING_112_00000:543050254430371840> smash up;;
Dongles are a serious matter;;
YES <@87241615671832576>;;
Wait...;;
Do I still have it I wonder?;;
hehehehe;;
;;
It's weird I know;;
lmao;;
But that was like the beginning;;
When I couldn't do anything properly;;
haha;;
i love that;;
I like it;;
Ohh dear, what did we just unveil üòÑ;;
Me at my darkest hour <@87241615671832576>;;

Also true <@207416847019016202>;;

I'm listening to Powerwolf atm;;
Binary divide right now;;
Ooh okay <@87241615671832576> I'll leave you to your studying;;

hahaha;;
yeahh steams a bitch üòÑ;;
60 USD = 60  EUR ofc;;
Only with us <@87241615671832576> , poor people living in rich countries...fooook;;
no, living in poor corrupted country is a bitch;;
all you complaining europeans, i laugh;;
yeahh I have thought about learning russian, just so i could get the cheap games xD;;
and <@207416847019016202>  , is a winner here cause his rich in a poor country;;
and yes, you are right <@207416847019016202>;;
also think about getting russian job <@87241615671832576>;;
i am going to immigrate now;;
like, 400-500 bucks a month if you unskilled and live in moscow;;
Hell yeah <@87241615671832576>;;
<@207416847019016202>  is abusing the system;;
im not rich but youre right, im above average poor, i think;;
And the system is abusing me;;
martinique gangbanging kelly;;
My ass is hurting;;
If you knew how much I bought my beach apartment you would've felt my pain. For the same price I could've got a freaking palace in Jamaica;;
tell me;;
we will compare it to moscow prices;;
182000 euros;;
Are we talking about our riches now?;;
I have a potato sack.. that's all..;;
you rich ass <@526319824704634881>;;
Damn!;;
I'm not rich <@207416847019016202> ...;;
And it can barely hold 4 people ...One freaking bedroom, one bathroom, one living room and one kitchen. My brother lives in a freaking castle for less than this;;
If I was rich I wouldn't be in Mordor right now..;;
my 40m2 appartment on outskirts of moscow costs 109k euros... ;;
i dont know how big yours <@348165887347523594>;;
okay got it;;
Omg!! Wtf!! I can't handle the prices you guys are talking about.;;
i rent the same appartment now, but dont know how much it would cost.;;
That's math I can't do this late..;;
Fok;;
lol;;
presumably not less then 100k also;;
Damn, this does sound expensive though <@207416847019016202>;;
I need to find how big mine is. Give me a minute;;
thats because russian prices on houses/appartments are hige;;
especially moscows;;
Nothing compared to the prices in Belgium;;
all big cities have those problems;;
Hooo boy;;
and they are equal for everyone, so poor locals pay them yoo;;
not all big cities have average salary 400-500 bucks <@87241615671832576>;;
Mine is 50m2 and I have two patios of about 20 m2 each.;;
patios!!!!!!!!!!!!!;;
Guys with first world problems..;;
yeah;;
And I'm out... Byyeeeeeeeee;;
Cya <@526319824704634881>!!!;;
Where I live you can get some really nice cheap houses at around 147.412,09 EUR;;
I don't understand how it can be this expensive in Russia though. It doesn't scale with your salaries;;
That's really low out in the country side;;
I'd estimate the average in Copenhagen would be around 469.038,49 EUR;;
It's always around the ‚Ç¨ 200.000 here;;
No matyer where you live;;
Except in Wallonia, there the houses are cheaper because it's a shithole;;
youre right, it doesnt scale <@348165887347523594> ;;
thats perk of poor countries - low salaries and high prices;;
indeed;;
the only people who win are the really rich people.;;
That's why I prefer games;;
I feel everything feels more even;;
True <@87241615671832576>;;
lol;;
Except in animal crossing, I'm a multi-millionnaire in that game;;
I exploit everything;;
haha;;
just ripping off everyone;;
Yeah, I'm the actual worst mayor ever;;
Yeah only the rich win;;
russia btw has only 13% income tax;;
also thing for rich people;;
My dad won the lottery once;;
But he didn't win much;;
I on a 10% income tax but I'm on a special status. I can't substract my work related expenses from my income statement like others.;;
‚Ç¨640 which is still nice;;
That's nice <@!498246547838992414>;;
I want to play pummel party now üò¶;;
ill be able to coop that on saturday;;
when potato doesnt sleep;;
No problem bro;;

I realized though that the filter I have in OBS didn't let you guys hear the song at all;;
When I do that kind of thing, I have to turn the filter off;;
Which one didn't we hear?;;
When I sing, the music volume goes down;;
ahh;;
Like the instruments;;
That yeah;;
But that's no biggie;;
We got more of your lovely singing voice;;
It would help me hide my horrendous voice hahaha;;
Lmao;;
Man I heard myself afterwards;;
It was so bad;;
But I've got charimsa;;
I'm going places;;

This is absurd;;
I hate it;;

Dental flossing;;
Sticking a piece of rope in my gums and bleeding out;;

I have met him before, he's actually a nice guy. I just dont wanna have to be all happy and smiles for a few hours with him;;
Lol;;
lol <@488734758847905803> your gums bleeding either means you're doing it wrong or you have bad gums haha;;
It's cause I rarely do it, but I want to change that;;
Same. I even put the floss right next to my toothbrush and I will move them out of the way to get my toothbrush and still not use the floss lol;;
wow that some problems you have guys;;
Lmao hahaha I do it in the shower cause blood;;
im pretty sure youre in the shower right now;;
Yeah <@207416847019016202> , I know you don't have that problem;;
because of blood;;
You don't floss cause you don't have real teeth;;
i dont have any teeth;;
You just stick your teeth in water;;
no real, no fake;;
Every night;;

No, just learned it from watching terminator;;
I mean they have metal teeth sometimes but not real ones;;

I'm fine;;
I woke up way too early cause I fell asleep way to early as well;;
Well I guess you are ready then;;
"I'm just listening to a  fun episode of midnight in the desert that kinds of dives in ""why people are so attuned to crazy wacky conspiracy theories"" and makes a bit fun of the wackiest ones.";;
I still hope that I'll get 1 or 2 more hours of sleep though.;;
How are you though?;;
Well conspiracies are extremely fun;;
I am good, just on my way to a class of project management;;
Noice, good luck with that ;).;
Thank you;;

Me: I want to pay through mobile app, but it says that my phone number was changed, and I can't;;
Bot: could you please rephrase that?;;
Me: connect me to operator!!!;;
Bot: I can connect you to the operator only if I can't provide answer myself, so please explain your problem.;;
Me: I want to pay, but phone number changed. ;;
Bot: Okay... connecting you to the operator...;;
And morning everyone;;

I can't tell if you're joking or not <@329001373670572044> haha;;

Oh shit. But, was it a comfortable basement? The image I have of basements is that it wouldn't be too comfortable lol;;
its comfortable enough;;
Sup mangos. Morning/afternoon/evening and ho well night everyone;;
I just finished Wolfenstein 2 and ho my god this game has entered my top ten I don't know what list. The ending is so gratifying. Everything about it is actually. Definitely one of my fav games of all time.;;
So many moments it gave me goosebumps. Fokin loved this game. Now I already feel a bit of nostalgia. I highly recommend it for those who haven't played it yet.;;
cool;;
someday i will get to that game;;
<@329001373670572044> I wish I had a basement for my own  self honestly. It would be my H.Q;;
You should <@207416847019016202>;;
i sadly share the basement with my brother on the weekends;;
Good job <@!329001373670572044>, your dongle just grew to 2!;;

Ho, damn, that sucks when you wanna bring girls over right? üòÖ <@329001373670572044>;;

Or just friends too. Just not having it to yourself as usual sucks anyway;;

Insomnia, thy art a cruel bitch;;
Don't know her;;
We wasn't introduced;;
You basically ignored all her texts;;
What did you expect?;;
And I'm too shy to say hi myself;;
Once I hit 19 I had my own place. I was tired of sharing a space;;
hm i never lived alone;;
"but also i would not want to live with ""roommates"", as some people do";;
I lived alone most of my early twenties. Then I traveled a lot and lived with families or by my self.;;
Good morning all!;;

I hope Brazil doesn't get in the world cup <@488734758847905803>;;

Yeah <@348165887347523594>;;
Gotta go get ready to do some shit foook;;

Yeah yeah yeah;;
You guys won't even be able to beat each other tonight;;
I can't play the old arcade one, it's just too old for me. I played New order, Old blood Dlc, and New Colossus <@488734758847905803>;;

Mango doesn't have an asshole because he's shitting out from his mouth;;
I meant the new order and the old blood;;
Ho yes I did play all three of them then;;

Crims, must be hard being soft and flakey. Would be a shame if a mango ripped through your waffle;;
Nice <@348165887347523594> !;;
With what? <@488734758847905803> a round mango? the worst you can do is to get that vile juice on my waffle;;
A heavy mango rolling over that soft crims-dongle-like waffle;;
Soft as butter;;
A heavy mango? you must be hella weak to think a Mango is heavy...;;
Heavier than a waffle;;
Plus, I'm talking about my mango;;
Waffles can't lift;;
Your mango?;;
My mango;;
The purple one...;;
Yes;;
Precisely;;
Purple Because he's being choked my all the waffles he's pissed off;;
Lol, he looks pretty happy in this pic ;;

Of a mango who just ate a bunch of Belgian waffles like it was nothing;;
Shit, I think he wants seconds;;
Ofc people eat Belgian waffles because they're hella tasty;;
Don't get me on that vile shit like a brasillian mango;;

Good night  <@526319824704634881>!!!;;

I am 0% asian;;
But *okay* <@207416847019016202>;;
0 is pretty bad for traditions;;
oof;;
Maybe that's why I have such  *good*  grades... because I'm 0% Asian...;;
Probably;;
Well he's 100% lootbox free though.;;
Gonna chance my location to Belgium on my EA account so I can get better stuff;;
Also hi everyone;;

<@207416847019016202> crims is not Asian so he isn't pressured to be Asian.. hehe;;
Ooohhh..okay.. Is it because he's a waffle that's why he is STD free?;;
probably;;
new legend... new way to die? <@526319824704634881>;;
Was about to say <@207416847019016202> !! Hahahhaa ;;

Ohh..sorry to hear that.. maybe you're burntout since you've been working so much..;;
Very possible. Just gonna try and recover today as much as I can. Gonna have a nice relaxing weekend too so that should help;;
i know what youre doing... youre adapting for discord average timezone <@526319824704634881>;;
I miss watching those epic apex skills you got..but don't force yourself to stream <@416803598173995018>  when you don't feel like it coz it might stress you even more..;;
I think I'm unconsciously adapting <@348165887347523594>'s sleep pattern.. üòÇüòÇüòÇ;;
Don't worry <@207416847019016202> ..I will go back to my original sleep pattern and sleep when you stream..üòÇü§£;;
Cuphead is coming to the Switch!;;

Yup that's great, now you can throw your 300$ device through the room in frustration <:flufflol:544490471054114817>;;

So, I don't think there'll be a stream today;;
I've been on the phone with my ISP for a while, but no dice;;
Internet company out to get you <@488734758847905803>;;
Oh noooo!!;;
First it was electric company...now ISP?!;;
Government is out for mango!;;
Conspiracy;;
Or maybe it‚Äôs just <@207416847019016202>;;
Or not mango season. Weather is too dry;;
Good point <@348165887347523594>;;
Damn I'm starting to hate my job. I thought today's mission would take just about 2 hours. I ve been sweating it for about 4 hours now. And it's not about to be done;;
I was planning on streaming some more Redeemer üòû;;
Fok it, I'll still do it once I'm home;;
"We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore";;
Lol I know the feeling <@348165887347523594> sorry bro;;
when you will be home? <@348165887347523594>;;
im afraid ill be sleeping;;
They won't shut the mango guys!;;
I'll fight the power;;
We're not gonna take it!!!  <@488734758847905803>;;
any of you having problems with twitter?;;
Don't have a twitter account yet <@87241615671832576> ....Having Facebook is already pretty overwhelming for me üòÖ;;
LMAO <@537319907541516311> , you raided <@132996055267540992> exactly when he hosted someone else hahahahaha;;
GG <@537319907541516311> lol;;
Most awkward raid ever hahaha....;;
hahahaha....I'M FOKIN DYING;;
Don't die;;
Dying is not fun;;
I have experience;;
I die a lot;;
I know that üòÇ;;
Ho man, I laughed so hard when I understood what was happening üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;
I'm waiting for skydaze's reaction;;
Hehehe;;
I like how it turned out, but it's not the best I can do, because it's 1am here lol;;
Did you post it?;;
I dm'ed it;;
Do you want me to post it in <#512649569595555860>  ?;;
Sure;;
done;;
I want some ham rn lol;;
I am really hungry;;
lol;;
I'm leaving work now. I'll be home in about 15minutes;;
That's good;;
Also, is the anthem hype dead already?;;
Because I haven't heard you fangirl over it anymore <@348165887347523594>;;
Lol <@348165887347523594> when I try and do something nice, it backfires. LMAO;;
LMAO <@537319907541516311> , I'm still laughing about it though;;
I still play it once every so often <@498246547838992414> . I noticed some new missions this morning. I spent an hour and a half trying to beat one with no success. Shit was hard and so frustrating.;;
Let's be honest, the game is a huge disappointment. It's extremely repetitive and the main story was short as hell.;;
Good job <@!348165887347523594>, your dongle just grew to 28!;;
But somehow, I still love the gameplay and wish that the upcoming dlc's will bring this game back on track(I highly doubt it would be on time though).;;
There is so much wrong with this game, that it would need a miracle to save it at this point. But who knows. The gameplay mechanic is so focused on the flying and fighting that they have completely neglected any other interesting aspect it could've had. Right now, I just don't know how they could possibly save this game.;;
The story , the dialogue, the fokin script plain sucks;;
what up all;;
Hey hello <@442488674144223242> , seems that everyone went early sleeping. Myself included. Freaking long ass days are making me real sleepy on evenings;;
These past 3 days I've been waking up exactly at the same time. 2:00am ...;;
Morning  guys;;
After co op sessions I tend to go sleep very early - about 3 am....;;
I can understand that;;
Gaming can be draining;;
And morning <@207416847019016202> . Have a great day. Gonna play some Anthem. I've been having a sudden  urge for it since yesterday. I have such bad taste;;
haha good luck;;
<@348165887347523594> 2am is approximately the time im getting to sleep;;
Henlo frens;;
I am in school;;
It's really nice outside;;
Hey guys! Hope you're all doing well..;;
<a:jumpingmango:546688169257467904>;;
Hello!!;;
hey <@87241615671832576>;;
Thank you for the play yesterday <@207416847019016202> it was fun, even though the persistent crashing;;
yeah thank you too;;
i liked it, even though i still dont understand fucking game;;
i usually play games very slow at my own, and thats why i never liked all those mmorpgs, because people are very quick;;
well i love elder scrolls online and star wars mmorpg, but i play them alone, without any randoms;;
Morning everyone!;;
Good job <@!557380058566623233>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
Morning <@557380058566623233> . Congrats on your baby dongle. They are so cute when they're still young.;;
Hahaha;;
Enjoy it while you still can...cause they grow up fast and once they do...damn they get ugly and mean;;
I get it <@207416847019016202>;;
I think it will be right to just learn first at you own pace and then afterwards just go in and play with others when you know what to do;;
no, its alright for me to coop without knowing too üòÄ;;
its two separate things;;
one is joy from the game itself, another from coop;;
and from building orange house too of course;;
https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/sekiro-shadows-die-twice;;
Good job <@!455797717763883009>, your dongle just grew to 19!;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od5A36FudD4;;
ohh yeahh I never got to see the Orange house;;
It's going to be the new child show;;
Damn <@455797717763883009> there's 15 points in difference in IGN and IGN Japan xD;;
Yeah i noticed;;
I gues they are not totally in agreement;;
"Japanese be like "" Not enough difficulty""";;
Haha;;
Morning, guys!;;
Yo Mango!;;
Hey <@557380058566623233> !;;
Hey <@455797717763883009> !;;
What's good brother?;;
Nothing good lol;;
Hey <@488734758847905803>;;
How‚Äôs your day going <@488734758847905803>;;
Lol <@455797717763883009> , why?;;
you can see it in <#512649569595555860>  <@87241615671832576>;;
My day just started <@557380058566623233> , but I'm gonna have to go to a part of the city that I really hate;;
Just kidding, I'm just sleepy af;;
And have a lot of deadlines at work;;
Can't wait for Friday!;;
Woooo;;
Me too;;
Getting that sekiro booty;;
That sucks <@488734758847905803>;;
Yeah haha;;
But it's ok. I almost never go there;;
Yeahh I saw it now üòÑ;;

Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Performance Analysis + Graphics Comparison;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmVM1LsbHvA;;
Omg I hate Sao Paulo;;
Do you have your gun with you?;;
he always does;;
hiding it in the ass usually;;
lmao;;
and not for safety, just for pleasure;;
I'm getting it all assed up for <@207416847019016202> 's shit mouth;;
I don't own a gun hahha;;
I don't believe in them;;
yeah i dont undertand having a gun either;;
especially in russia, when now its not 90s;;
Hahaha;;
I mean, I don't want to kill someone if they come rob me. Public safety should be the government's job not mine;;
Otherwise I'll just be an anarchist;;
good affternoon everyone;;
"The other day some kids shot up a school. You know what the president said? ""If the teachers had guns, this wouldn't have happened""";;
But then if some teacher goes and shoots all the kids;;
to be very honest, i want to kill someone if they rob me. but now here possibility of robbing is not so very real as in brasil for example;;
Are you going to say that the kids should have had guns?;;
Damn <@207416847019016202> you crazy haha;;
I wouldn't kill someone over that in a million years;;
why would i want to spare some criminal fuck? <@488734758847905803>;;
*hits panic button discreetly*;;
Well, you don't know why they're doing that;;
It's wrong no matter what;;
But there are always  chances of changing;;
"i didnt had anyone trying to rob me in many many years, so i dont even have this idea, like ""should i have a gun""";;
I gotcha;;
i dont care about their chances;;
like, totally;;
its too much compassion for me;;
I don't think people deserve to die for that;;
But that's my opinion;;
i think they do, for robbing;;
its also only mine opinion;;
and its good that i dont make laws;;
Yeah no kidding haha;;
but as i said, its good that having gun not a nessecity here;;
at all;;
Yeah. I wish people here didn't consider having a gun either;;
i agree that having death sentence for robbing is too much, because court can be fucked up and a lot of innocents will die, especially in coutries like russia. but when you see somebody robbing you, you are fucking sure that they are not innocent;;
Check out @eurogamer‚Äôs Tweet: https://twitter.com/eurogamer/status/1108034777716797440?s=09;;
I don't get it <@455797717763883009>;;
Shakira Shakira;;
I still don't think it's enough to be killed over <@207416847019016202>;;
But we agree to disagree;;
Ohhhhh;;
well you are deffinitely enjoy being robbed then <@488734758847905803>;;
<@207416847019016202> will sing in his next stream;;
i wou;ld really love any person who ever tried to rob me, would die;
I don't, <@207416847019016202> , but I believe that people can change;;
And I believe that some people have to do things like that sometimes;;
they can change, but it has nothing to do with me;;
As a spiritist, I wouldn't rob no matter what;;
they have to do it, okay, still not my problem;;
But if I didn't believe in karma;;
and I WOULDNT ROB;;
so fuck them;;
And if my wife had cancer;;
And I had to somehow pay for the treatment otherwise she would definitely die;;
I wouldn't hesitate;;
so youre basically saying, that if you know reasons of people who robbed you, youd be okay with that?;;
But since I believe in a universal law, it wouldn't change the outcome;;
No;;
It's wrong either way;;
But things aren't just wrong or right;;
but youre almost saying it now;;
What I'm saying is that it becomes morally gray;;
In my opinion;;
It's not simple;;
im not saying things are black and white;;
im saying i want everybody who attacked me ever, to die;;
i would not forgive any of them for any reason;;
explanation of reason dont make up for a crime;;
Ok. I prefer to forgive and allow people to change their ways;;
and once again, im not saying that they should have death sentence. im just saying that morally they deserve to die;;
Instead of ending their changes in this incarnation;;
I see;;
I disagree very strongly;;
next time when robbing will go so far that you will be killed, dont forget to forgive them and allow them to change their ways;;
all this forgiving shit is usually takes place when youre not the one who getting killed or heavy beaten by robbers;;
Well, honestly, I've been robbed here in Brazil;;
i know;;
And even recently;;
And I still don't want those people to die;;
I want them to learn it's not right;;
well wait till they will kill you;;
Hey all! Feeling like shit still today and to add insult to injury, I‚Äôve pulled a muscle in my neck/shoulder and can‚Äôt turn my head right at all;;
I want my country to have good opportunities so people don't have to do that;;
and maybe they will  learn (no);;
Damn <@416803598173995018>;;
I want my country to have good opportunities so people don't have to do that;;
with that i totally agree;;
If they kill me, they're just killing my body;;
And it's an unfortunate thing;;
But dying doesn't mean the end;;
So I'm rather ok with that;;
Yep! Not happy at all lol;;
I'd rather it didn't happen of course;;
wow youre really sadistic <@488734758847905803>;;
Sadistic?;;
How so?;;
im not okay with anyone kill me in any way;;
Well, I'd of course fight for my life;;
Damn <@416803598173995018> take care buddy;;
"I wouldn't just be like ""ok, you can kill me""";;
But I also don't want that person to die just because of that;;
Yeah I‚Äôm falling apart <@455797717763883009> lol;;
There are way worse things than dying;;
but what if during fighting for you life you will hurt them? they dont deserve that;;
They don't, but I'm not perfect.;;
But I'd feel guilty if say, in the fight, they became paraplegic;;
Because of me;;
Or if they died because of me;;
i dont know word paraplegic but im sure i would love it;;
But in the heat of the moment I wouldn't be able to measure my actions;;
It means being paralyzed from the waist down;;
oh cool;;
thats the least that i would want for all my offenders;;
Lol;;
That reaction;;
Haha;;
Geez what are we talking about? Lol;;
That's better than death;;
Got dark <@416803598173995018>;;
Brighten our days with your manly sex voice;;
lol seriously;;
I just realized that Mrs changeover is the only one who will ever hear that;;
we talk about would you kill someone who robbing you (without legal ramifications of course) <@416803598173995018>;;
I'll never hear your sex voice;;
And for this, I am sad;;
I‚Äôm sick so it‚Äôs not nice right now lol. It‚Äôs very raspy;;
Ohh yeah;;
Are they trying to kill me? <@207416847019016202>;;
I bet it's all raspy and shit;;
Hmmmmm;;
Lmao;;
Not necessarily;;
You freak;;
But we analyzed both scenarios;;
you cant be sure if they trying;;
they can unwillingly, it happens a lot;;
I wouldn‚Äôt go straight to killing but I‚Äôd defend myself. If they are trying to kill me, then yeah I‚Äôd kill them first;;
lets say they threating you;;
Always go for the eyes or throat;;
Or the dick;;
Gives you enough time to run lol;;
agreed with panda;;
Like I said, I'd try to defend myself. And I might even end up killing them. But I'd feel horrible about ut;;
What if he asks me to finish it? <@416803598173995018>;;
It*;;
Nice <@455797717763883009>;;
Groin kick and adrenaline fear run;;
Gotta do what you gotta do <@455797717763883009>;;
hahaha;;
i would feel horrible only because i would be afraid of law. but i would be pleased about the rest of situation;;
Yeah I‚Äôd be afraid of the law too;;
But if it‚Äôs self defense, you should be ok;;
Here at least. Not sure how Russia works;;
well theres layers to that;;
even if youre right, it will be months of investigation;;
Yeah that‚Äôs true;;
and in russia court system is fucked, so i wouldnt want to deal with that;;
It can be very flawed here too. Justice system is not good here;;
oh dude im sure here its worth;;
especially when its used against political opposition;;
Lol yeah probably;;
"we had this thing lately, as ""jail for reposts""";;
some people (not all of course) who reposted some political shit, anything, about corruption or so, was sued and went to jail;;
Damn that‚Äôs crazy;;
"recently putin openly said ""enough"", and it stopped";;
Lol, recently people in India were arrested for playing PubG;;
not entirely stopped of course, theres some tules to that, but at least it became not so tough;;
Seriously? <@455797717763883009>;;
i would arrest for that too;;
jk;;
https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265945/college-students-arrested-pubg-india-ban-police;;
Geez. That‚Äôs crazy!;;
Yeah, ridiculous;;
Seriously wow;;
yeah...;;
so dude america maybe shit crazy, but maybe some sick things you dont have <@416803598173995018>;;
Yeah man, why are they playing pubg of all games...;;
agreed with crim too;;
yeah I didnt know all of that stuff. We dont get a lot of international news here <@207416847019016202> so I dont know how other countries are;;
*fortnite is way better*;;
We get a lot of news from america <@416803598173995018> and neighboring countries, but literally nothing from the rest of the world;;
only the really big news gets here for the most part;;
people cant openly have demonstrations here. they kinda can, if its all oficial, but it usually end with a lot of people going temporarily to jail;;
so stuff like orange and panda just said, I had no clue;;
Me neither;;
we have this opposition leader, Navalny, hes very famous as a blogger who fight corruption and always make a lot of videos with facts about putins friends stealing money;;
well, he spends half of time in jail;;
not a real jail;;
but temporarily jails where you go for 15 days for hooliganism and stuff;;
hes usually go there after demonstrations;;
"he tried to go for presidency couple of times, but of course goverment came up with laws like ""you cant if you went to jail""";;
and therefore they are happy to put him in jail;;
lol of course. Putin will never lose an election it seems like;;
When you're the only contestant, it's quite difficullt;;
lol yeah exactly;;
of course he will not;;
as all others post soviet presidents;;
how old is he though;;
well ukraine apparently at least changes them;;
hes 66. there a lot of cheap rumors about him being long dead;;
or killed;;
because there s a lot of photos of different looking putins;;
lol;;
some of them are probably imposters;;
that's always there;;
but, who can be sure if original one is still in place;;
if he's killed, it should be celebrated. not to overtake him and do the same shit;;
well you can celebrate it, but problems is not about him;;
it was always like this in russia;;
in any periond of time;;
yeah I was gonna say, russia has been that way for as long as I know;;
every our ruler was monarch in one way or another;;
i dont say that having different presidents changes a lot, but russia is not changeable it this way;;
at least in a short run;;
we need ages for that;;
couple years ago it was huge rumor here- putin wasnt public at least a week. nobody did see him. so there was rumors that he dead;;
after that he of course came back;;
but still, you cant be sure if it was him haha;;
maybe he jus had bad indian take out food lol;;
lol;;
haha;;
i would say that i would love to try that, but judging from experience, i dont like to try local food wherever i go;;
not because of food;;
but because of people who sell it;;
they are always too communicative;;
i prefer to find local supermarket or fkc/mcdomalds where noone bothers me;;
lol orange doesnt like social interactions. Im that way half the time too;;
oh dude you cant imagine how i dont like them;;
chat to people i know is one thing;;
im always open to chat here or in audio or whatever;;
if any of you would go here i would spend mcuh possible time with you here;;
same goes for <@455797717763883009>;;
but fuck, anyone who i dont know, i dont want ANY interaction;;
lol yeah Im the same way;;
they can be dying and crying for help, i dont care, because it will ruin song that im currently listen;;
Lmao you‚Äôre an interesting guy orange;;
LMAO;;
Please tell me you're listening to Shakira;;
yes i am haha;;
oh i didnt mean shakira;;
i know her but dont listen;;
I know, but that tracks is going on in my head;;
Lol;;
yeah i will sing hips for you <@455797717763883009>;;
Please do that on your next stream please lol;;
i will, but it will be mumbling of couple of words from that song;;
I'm sorry I've been so inactive. I miss this dang group. How is everyone?;;
hey <@535295021482508299>;;
how are you;;
im good;;
Hey <@535295021482508299> , we've missed you too!;;
I've been pretty absent the last couple days too;;
I just got back home from the most chaotic part of the city;;
<@207416847019016202> I'm doing well! Busy as heck'n but hey haha;;
<@488734758847905803> oh dang how was that?;;
Crazy. ;;
You have to pay attention to your stuff 100% of the time you're there;;
"i guess ""driving shotgun"" in that neighborhood has literally meaning? <@488734758847905803>";;
just to be safe;;
Hahahaha;;
It's not unsafe in the sense that you'll get killed;;
It's unsafe because of pickpockets;;
And people trying to take advantage of you;;
i guess its dark already there?;;
It's one of the only dangerous places where there are more pickpockets than actual muggers;;
Yeah take my wallet and put some money in it;;
In Brazil? The sun is still setting;;
Lmao;;
Right <@455797717763883009> ?;;
Exactly üòÇ;;
good that i dont have wallet;;
You just eat your money? <@207416847019016202>;;
I guess hunger in Russia is getting terrible;;
i almost dont use cash;;
no need;;
Same. ;;
But in that place you get good discounts for using cash;;
Yeah just the card;;
discounts for cash?;;
Yeah;;
we dont have those;;
We had those in India before. Not anymore;;
Cause the machines they use to swipe the card charges them like 2.5% for each transaction;;
i understand that shops pay fee for using cards, but still, no one charges here for that;;
i know;;
here too;;
So when you use cash they give good discounts;;
but they dont charge for that;;
And also for filing tax;;
Even more than just 2.5;;
Yep;;
Can't declare what isn't traceable;;
They can show less earnings and pay less tax;;
Exactly;;
Especially when you're a technician or something;;
How is anyone going to prove I took my Xbox to that shop if I don't use a card?;;
yeah i got all good sides of shops using cash;;
but here prices are equal;;
and all shops interested in more buyers, so they have to have card payment;;
moscow is almost at the point where street fast food have card payment;;
which would seem crazy several years ago;;
for example, i used cash only once this month. and its because i bought something in huge local eshop, which is very greedy and doesnt have card payment;;
so panda, if you will go to moscow, dont think about changing money at airport or something, you dont need that <@455797717763883009>;;
I guess I can use my TransferWise card?;;
to be honest i never heard of TransferWise;;
all i can say that my mastercard worked in all countries ive been;;
if using TransferWise  will be a problem, ill give you my empty card;;
dont know though if it will be law problem haha;;
I feel so unworldly haha I'm from a tiny town in Canada. You guys are awesome;;
Hope you all are having a wonderful day! @here;;
all i know about canadians is that they all are afraid of dark;;
little how i met your mother reference;;
hey <@524820041976250368>;;
<@524820041976250368> hello! How are you;;
<@524820041976250368> hope you're having a good one too!;;
<@207416847019016202> lol. You'll be cooking for me when I come to Moscow;;
no, but i can show you nearest mcdonalds lol;;
Hey! <@207416847019016202> <@535295021482508299> <@455797717763883009> how‚Äôre y‚Äôall? And I‚Äôm doing good! <@535295021482508299>;;
im good;;
playing some Satisfactory;;
Sounds fun, I just got done with jury duty for the day so laying down;;
laying down is good;;
Just having my dinner;;
Brazil street food vendors have credit card machines <@207416847019016202> hahaha;;
It was hilarious the first time I saw it;;
Hey <@524820041976250368>;;
<@535295021482508299> , you gonna stream tonight?;;
yeah, russian street food almost have it too <@488734758847905803>;;
we are heading there;;
<@488734758847905803> nahh I work tonight. Support night!;;
In the 90s, Greece had portable credit card machines in their cabs. Ran on satellite network. Isn't that insane?;;

No you never hit me as the type. I just couldn't resist a stupid joke;;

a lot of people who drink vodka are not alcoholics or something;;
I didn't have to watch your channel bud;;

Freelancing is weird;;
What have you got planned for the weekend?;;
Oh gosh! I hated to work those days when I was living in the US <@488734758847905803>;;
Just getting together with friends and gaming of course hahahaha. I also have to tech a private class on Sunday of all days;;
Yeah it sucks. On the bright side though, there are some weekdays where I don't work at all;;
Oh cool! What game do you have in mind?;;
And what kind of dance is it on Sunday?;;

Tango?;;

Yo <@416803598173995018> !;;
Whats up man? Hows the day going?;;
<@488734758847905803> wish I lived near the beach;;
Good job <@!311684705810513921>, your dongle just grew to 8!;;
I always felt at home at a beach;;
Going slow haha;;
Well, it's about 2 hours from here <@311684705810513921>  , but not too bad;;
hey <@311684705810513921> <@488734758847905803> <@416803598173995018> <@557380058566623233> ;;
morning to everybody;;
I prefer the woods personally, but the ocean is great;;
Have you ever lived near the beach?;;
Hey <@207416847019016202> how you doing today?;;
I was born in Florida and lived in California;;
<@207416847019016202> morning!;;
Oh nice;;
im good, about to continue LA Noire <@416803598173995018>;;
The ocean has amazing regenerative powers;;
Morning! <@207416847019016202>;;
i hate water and cant swim, but even i prefer sea/ocean to forest;;
Yeah, oranges just sink;;
Really?;;
Man ocean is great. Especially if you live close to it;;
Yeah. I just don't like the sun on my skin because of my tattoos;;
especially if its warm ocean, and not the one i lived nearby;;
Nice <@207416847019016202> you streaming later or soon?;;
And there are too many tattoos to put on sunblock without complaining;;
soon i think <@416803598173995018> ;;
maybe in 1-2 hours;;
I live in the Caribbean best beaches in the world;;
Good job <@!557380058566623233>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
oh sweet, I will be able to watch! <@207416847019016202>;;

Never heard of Punta Cana? <@488734758847905803>;;
I have <@557380058566623233>;;
My friends went there last year;;
Yeah I really like the ocean. Mostly the beach though. The cliche of walking at night on the beach is one for a reason;;
To a resort or something;;
Next door to me;;
fuck i afraid i will be almost sleeping, but we will see <@416803598173995018>;;
Nice <@311684705810513921> !;;
Oh damn <@557380058566623233> !;;
Womango is gonna be jelly hahaa;;
It's so beautiful there;;
I've only seen pics of course;;
Yep <@311684705810513921>;;
One day I'll live near a beach;;
Is really something else <@488734758847905803>;;
It is really relaxing <@311684705810513921>;;
<@207416847019016202> its ok man, I know the time differences suck lol;;
im live all;;
I'll come live in your basement <@311684705810513921>;;
Deal;;
Yeah I imagine <@557380058566623233> !;;
Niiiice!;;
I was certain you were just gonna hit some panic button <@311684705810513921> ;;
But now you've sealed a verbal contract;;
Lol;;
yeah, its also that i always stream early morning in saturday, and thats why i dont stay too late at friday night <@416803598173995018>;;
Didn't say for free ;);
Lol;;
Lmaaaao;;
Damn my half-baked conniving schemes!;;
by not staying too late i mean that i stay up to 3am maximum;;
Lol <@207416847019016202>;;
Gotta read that fine print;;
yeah I understand <@207416847019016202> how do you like that game?;;
Damn <@311684705810513921> , I got played by my own game;;
la noire? <@416803598173995018>;;
its good;;
detective system is shit;;
but i like story and cutscenes;;
and the fact that game doesnt punish you for being a bad player;;
oh thats cool. I havent played it in a very long time but I do remember liking it;;
and now im at that point in the game very story really start developing;;
before it were like several separate cases;;
Nice! I dont remember it much so hopefully I can watch your stream today;;
good;;
but to be honest last couple of days im deep into that Satisfactory game;;
I dont know anything about that, what is it?;;
I honestly didn't give la noire enough attention. I need to get it again;;
nothing for you, just game about building factory haha <@416803598173995018>;;
you cant even shoot in that game i think;;
ahh ok lol. I would probably enjoy to watch it though;;
yeah you would;;
we streamed it with jonny, and we will again when theyll fix co op bugs;;
game runs good offline. but when you play coop, one of you is host, and for the host game crashes from time to time;;
so it crashes for everyone;;
and also there problems are with connetion to the session;;
Ahh ok. Hopefully they fix that soon then;;
yeah...;;
"i dont know if english has that phrase, but in  russian we say ""hope dies last""";;
In portuguese we have that saying;;
Hope is the last to die;;
yeah;;
exactly like that;;
We have it in Spanish too;;
haha cool;;
Yeah I‚Äôve heard sayings like that before;;
No <@416803598173995018>;;
Stupid English doesn't have that saying;;
Nice <@557380058566623233> !;;
YOURE STUPID ENGLISH!;;
Hahahahaah;;
Lmaaao;;
Also, isn‚Äôt English your first language? Lol;;
first but not favourite lol;;
Good job <@!207416847019016202>, your dongle just grew to 34!;;
yeah baby;;
Nice dongle;;
If is <@416803598173995018>;;
It*;;
lol;;
But I feel like Portuguese has more options to express yourself sometimes;;
Yes same with every Roman language <@488734758847905803>;;
Yeah that makes sense;;
Yep <@557380058566623233>;;
I cannot say shit in Dutch, and thats a Germanic language;;
you cant say the word shit <@498246547838992414> ?;;
I see;;
interesting;;
Wow;;
*writes down* waffles can't say the word 'shit';;
WaffleShit;;
lmaaaaaao <@455797717763883009>;;
Aren't English a Germanic language heavily influenced by Latin? I guess I am totally wrong at that side.;;
English is anglo-saxonic;;
but it does borrow latin especially in the scientific and medical fields;;
lol waffles it;;
but that's mostly because that was the way doctors and scientists broke the linguistic barriers up until the end of the 20th century I believe;;
gaaaah autocorrect;;
waffleshit new fav word;;
I hate when autocorrect ruins the timing of my  jokes <@111826600395378688>;;
hahahahah;;
is it waffle made of shit;;
or shit that a waffle took;;
or a shit that has little squares?;;
"I can say the word shit, but what I can't say is any word with the ""th"" sound in it";;
Damn being irish;;
Like thanks sounds like tanks;;
time to clean the house.;;
put your tongue between your teeth <@498246547838992414>;;
Wot;;
Ok;;
It's weird;;
But it sounds alright;;
yeah stupid Irish;;
Yeah lad;;
Im Irish so I can say that and its ok;;
I agree;;
Being irish means I can make ira jokes;;
But I have trouble speaking like a normal human being;;
lmao;;
What part of Ireland you from?;;
Southern, Wicklow county;;
Ahh ok, my family is from the Galway area and my Fiance's family is from Cork;;
Ooh cool;;
The O'Flaherty's and the O'Caroll's lol;;
and Sullivan too;;
Fooking Irish;;
Ahh, my mom's last name isn't with an O';;
It's normal;;
And I have a Belgian last name;;
So it's pretty fucked;;
yeah bloody americans took away the O's when our families came here lol so technically there are no O's in our names now here;;
Also French was the language of the aristocracy <@488734758847905803>;;
Fuck French;;
Lol;;
Givin' me hell in school;;
lol Im French too. Im such a mutt its ridiculous;;
do the french not like the irish?;;
That's cool it happens to me too <@416803598173995018>;;
"Idk the ""who hates who"" in the world";;
But I know the Northern Half of Belgium (Flanders) HATES the south (Wallonia);;
ahh ok lol;;
And I know it's kinda a joke where everyone hates Antwerp or West-Flanders here;;
That's an understatement <@498246547838992414>;;
Oof <@557380058566623233>;;
How come?;;
You Belgian?;;
They really hate each other;;
<@557380058566623233> I have sooo many different nationalities in my blood;;
I don't know how they are still one country;;
"Like ""Barely not a civil war"" hate";;
I don't even dare to go to a Wallonian bar alone;;
Me too that's what I meant <@416803598173995018> French Spanish Italian and latinamerican;;
ahhh ok. Its cool though to find out the history behind them all though;;
No not Belgian but have friends there <@498246547838992414>;;
Ahh okay <@557380058566623233>;;
Yeah, they're not wrong about the relations with the North and South;;
did I hear relations? <:whattho:557321833578364939>;;
Some little town got pretty F-ed up because it was an island from Flanders in Wallonia;;
Like french people fucked up the entire town, wanting it to become Walloon;;
that's true <@557380058566623233> (about french being the language of the rich cats lol);;
but why to they call it french fries;;
nothing french about them;;
If you're interested look up Voeren, idk how it's in english;;
All out civil war over there;;
Lol true <@278571432588345345>;;
The army even got involved;;
these are the existential quandaries that occupy my mind;;
Belgian french fries are the best <@278571432588345345>;;
I will check it out I am a sucker for history <@498246547838992414>;;
It's interesting to learn about <@557380058566623233>;;
Oh what it ia to be on vacation! No worries in the works. <@278571432588345345>;;

which hasn't happened in a long time lol;;
Play with your dongle <@278571432588345345>;;
Oh the existential problem! <@278571432588345345>;;
He has to fill up to many hours a day <@498246547838992414>;;
Hmm;;

https://www.gameinformer.com/gdc-2019/2019/03/21/cupheads-creator-desperately-wants-him-in-super-smash-bros;;
Lol;;
I'm about to go live guys!;;
Get your dongles ready;;

@everyone - I am live, come chill in the shade of the mango tree. https://twitch.tv/purplemango_gaming;;
Dang stream is off the chains boooooooiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii;;
Ugh wish I could watch!;;
lmaaao what a great stream guys!;;
That was so fun! Glad I was able to catch a little bit;;
I was expecting a regular stream, and i jump into the stream with the purple dongle signing his seeds off !;;
Lol it was opera level spectacular;;
Ohhh damn I missed it! I will watch the vod then!;;
Hahahahaah;;
It was hilarious;;
<@409836692158021632> I'm afraid that twitch will block it;;
Because of copyright;;
I'm trying to download the vodbut it's not letting me;;
Most likely;;
DAMN, no clips either? <@488734758847905803>;;
Oh no... üò≠;;
why will it get blocked?;;
Copyright music;;
It was an epic stream;;
ahhh ok <@455797717763883009>;;
I have wondered about that. So if I used a bands music for say, my intro on twitch. Would that be copyright infringement? I dont get how that works lol;;
Yup it would be I guess, just like YouTube;;
Don't be this guy...ever...;;
https://twitter.com/witchytwitchytv/status/1109003277369253888?s=19;;
damn that's creepy;;

I'm live! First time in over 2 weeks, feels way longer;;
The Music of Red Dead Redemption 2 | Red Bull Music Festival https://youtu.be/2uwb8u634M0;;
Omg  <@409836692158021632> that's the worst hahaha;;
Thanks <@275429891774742531>;;
Yeah, no clips;;
Clips had to be made immediately I think;;
they can be made at any time, but if you mean copyright thing, then maybe;;
Thanks <@207416847019016202> and <@537319907541516311> for stopping by today! I might be back on in a bit, depends on a few things;;
There was a recent update to SLOBS that changed how NDI plugin works and if you are running an older version of the NDI plugin it will stop working. Friend of mine had this issue and we found a fix so I wanted to share it here, I hope this is the right spot.;;
The Fix ;;
I've just encountered an issue where after updating to Streamlabs OBS 0.12.1 my NDI source was dead and I could not add a new one. With the help of the awesome FatHedonist the solution to this is to go to http://new.tk/NDIRedistV3 and install the runtime on the PC using Streamlabs OBS. After that it started working again. As a side note, there is a new version of the obs-ndi plugin for OBS Studio available at https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases;;
Yeah <@275429891774742531> here is fine;;
I'm gonna pin that message too!;;

And, in the summer holiday I'm going to italy for like 10 days;;
In Tuscany;;
and get on the hop-on bus tours lol;;
Sweet!;;
Beer, waffles and chocolate is all belgium has to offer;;
and shitty landmarks;;
Like the atomium?;;
like a statue of a kid pissing;;
hahaha, I was actually searching for a big statue;;
Then there it was right behind me;;
The atomium is the only cool thing in Brussels, and the cool architecture, for the rest there's not much to do in my opinion;;
Yeah Manneke Pis is really unimpressive;;
He doesn't even have a big dongle;;
lol;;
I haven't been to the atomium though;;
Next time for sure;;
I really like the plaza too;;
It's really impressive when you're standing in front of it;;
And plazas in Belgium are really fun to sit on a terrace on a sunny sunday afternoon;;
I stayed in this cool airbnb in a renovated soap factory, owned by 2 artists, was damn cool;;
yeah, and listen to some street music;;
Hmm, I've heard about the soap thing, yeah;;
Street music is lovely;;
yeah, spent a while with my dad listening to artist;;
In Hasselt there are loads of street musicians;;
But just avoid Limburg in general, there's nothing here;;
I've only been to Brussels, Bruges, Ghent and Antwerp;;
Need to explore the smaller ones;;
Sometimes the smaller ones are really cool;;
Antwerp is so cool to visit, but hell to live there;;
yeah, i got that vibe;;
;;
Hey <@436405671827603456> , thanks for joining us under the shade of the mango tree, buddy!;;

0/ Solo;;
Hey <@275429891774742531> !;;
How's it going buddy?;;
just woke up so not sure yet;;
Hahahahaah;;
Still checking systems;;

<@329001373670572044> , you gonna stream today?;;
How‚Äôs it going everyone?;;
Hey <@436405671827603456> !;;
Just chilling with the family , hbu?;;
Hanging with my girlfriend and I‚Äôm about to see my family! Coming home to New Jersey right now;;
Ohh shit;;
Where in NJ are you from?;;
I'm originally from nj;;
Monmouth county;;
Sparta to be exact;;
Ok, that's pretty far from where I am from;;
Sussex county;;
Is where Sparta is;;
Are you visiting your home town or were you traveling somewhere else?;;
Going to my hometown. Yeah I‚Äôve never heard of sparta! I‚Äôm like 30 min from the beach;;
Oh nice;;
I thought sparta was in greece?;;
Yeah Americans don't have enough imagination  <@498246547838992414>;;
isn't there a town called Belgium somewhere in the US;;
I might be wrong;;
There probably is;;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_(town),_Wisconsin;;
found it;;
Imma file a copyright claim;;
lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
Wait for me, in pretty sure There s moscow somewhere too  <@498246547838992414>;;
just sue the U.S;;
Theres a place called Salem in the US, it's a city in india lol;;
At least There s Saint Petersburg for sure;;
Join our cause  <@455797717763883009>;;
It is in Greece <@498246547838992414>;;
But there's also a Sparta in NJ hahs;;
Lol <@207416847019016202> wants to talk about creativity?;;
There is a town called Kanker in india, which translates to cancer from dutch;;
Like Stalingrad and Leningrad are creative names;;
At least Belgian names are creative *ignores bruges*;;
It's pretty normal to call city after something  <@488734758847905803>;;
"Bruges is ""Brugge"" in dutch, Bruggen literally translates to Bridges...";;
After something, but it's not creative is it?;;
<@488734758847905803> remember when I mentioned the place called triangle in the Netherlands?;;
Yeah;;
It's not rip off though  <@488734758847905803>;;
Meh. I guess that's a good point;;
They could at least have changed a little;;
Did you guys know that Amsterdam used to be called New York?;;
`orangegrad`;;
Dafucc <@488734758847905803>;;
I did not know that;;
new york used to be called new amsterdam before it was given to the british;;
Oh shit actually I mixed it up;;
like how australia used to be called new holland;;
Yeah <@417075583692963840> got it right;;
thank you so much for being my 100 follower <@488734758847905803>;;
No probs <@329001373670572044> !;;
I am honored haha;;
That I got to be the 100th;;
apple juice is *g o o d*;;
I love me some mango blood;;
Pretty sure orange likes mango blood;;
no, it better be pork;;
Hope everyone is having a good one!;;
<@488734758847905803> I love the dongle twitch emote so much lmao;;
I've just been going into streams saying:;;

As if russians can't be rude <@207416847019016202>;;
And, excuse me Belgium is More polite than the netherlands, so there;;
Do you want a cup of coffee?;;
Belgian: If it's not too much trouble;;
Dutch boi: Yeah, and a bit fast please 'cause I'm in a hurry, and could you make it with more sugar and milk please,   and may I please have a cookie with that, thanks;;
Hey <@541966272561283082> ! The day has been good;;

Wassup chat;;
I'm working with a team of illustrators but the one creating your logo is <@455797717763883009> ! He is the one you should be thanking :üòÉ;;
Hey <@345984543246909442>;;
Just watching the rest of death love robots;;
Or whatever;;
Omg I'm in love with that show! <@488734758847905803>;;
How far have you guys gotten with it and which episodes do you like?;;
We just finished watching all of it haha;;
I guess my favorites are the first and the second one!  <@409836692158021632>;;
Are you watching it too?  <@409836692158021632>;;
<@467974634977886220> yeah I've finished it too.;;
I definitely love the 1st and 7th episodes.;;
Which one is the 7th?;;
The werewolf episode;;
Oh yeah! Love that one too;;
They are all so amazing;;
Definitely! The Zima Blue episode probably has the best story out of all of it.;;
They're all so well done. ü§Ø;;
As an animator it was amazing to see all these incredible animations, with awesome stories. It has become one my favorite shows so fast haha;;
That's awesome!;;
Have you seen Into the Spiderverse?;;
The Zima blue story is really good! What do you think it means? We debated a little bit about the story, I want to know if we have the same thought;;
Haven't seen spiderverse. Is it good?;;
Oh wow...as an animator, you MUST watch Into The Spiderverse.;;
Really? Cool! I definitely will;;
Good job <@!467974634977886220>, your dongle just grew to 7!;;
The Spiderverse story itself is excellent and imo it's a benchmark as to how good animation can go. ;;
It's a movie that'll be used in schools to show kids what they can achieve with art.;;
Wow, I really want to watch it now haha;;
"For Zima Blue, it felt to me like a ""circle of life/story of creation"" theme. ";;
The protagonist went full circle. From being created, to self awareness, to become godlike and then going back to square one after achieving  his purpose in life. ;;
It's very beautiful and open to a lot of different interpretations of life imo.;;
So true! We felt like that too, that it can open to lots of interpretations.;;
After hundreds of years he went back to his origins, and even thought he was godlike like you said, he wanted to find peace in the simple things in life;;
Yeah definitely.;;
"I think the underlying theme is ""finding your purpose in life"". And they made a story of someone achieving that purpose so completely that they were ready to go back and deconstruct themselves again to their simplest form.";;
I agree. And they did it in a brilliant way. Because in the beginning it just seems a little crazy and even funny all of those blue paintings haha, they did a really good job with the surprise factor;;
I loved the yogurt one also! haha;;
It's funny and it's like so true. That's probably what would happen in that scenario;;
Ohhh the Yogurt! I watched that with my daughter haha! She loved it too!;;
When that happens, it's time to move to...Ohio! üòÇ;;
We both love that episode so much!;;
hahahaha that's true, Ohio would be the only way;;
Some of the episodes are more beautiful and insightful then necessarily having an amazing story. But they are all good in general in my opinion;;
I loved the farmers one;;
I want a second season like, tomorrow please;;
Yes! Some episodes really pushed the boundaries of photo realism. ;;
I definitely want a second season too! ;;
Or maybe even producing a whole series out of some of them.  1 episode is definitely not enough for some of those stories!;;
Yeah you are so right, I was just about to say the same thing;;
I want an entire season for the first episode universe;;
Oh man. I would love that! More of Sonnie's backstory and show all her previous fights!;;
YESSSS;;
I loved Sonnie's character;;
Yeah, so bad ass!;;
I had no idea what was the show about when I started watching;;
2 minutes after the first episode I was in love with the show already üòÖ;;
It's sad that it might probably take at least a year for a second season;;
But the new season of The OA is finally out!;;
Can't wait;;
I hope they do another season! ;;
I thought going in that it was gonna be like Halo Legends or The Animatrix but it came out to be visually darker and bloodier.;;
I haven't tried The OA but I'll definitely check it out.;;
oh you have to! The OA is really good!;;
Considering that your favorite episode was Zima, I think that you would like the OA. Not that they are similar, but if you can appreciate that episode, than I think you would like the show;;
I'll check it out for sure and then we can discuss! üòÇ;;
haha it's the kind of show that we can discuss for hours;;
Ohhh I will let you know of my progress!;;
OA season 1 was awesome;;
<a:PickleRick:477501475933650955>;;
If Pickle Rick recommends it, then I must watch it! üòÅ;;
hahah;;
and it took 2 years I think, for the second season <@278571432588345345>;;
Morning everyone;;
Damn it's been 2 years?;;
I'm getting old;;
the OA?;;
It was actually december 2016!;;
yes <@87241615671832576> üôÇ;;
It's a show from netflix;;
have you watched it?;;
I gave not even heard about it;;
I guess I have to give it a chance. The thing is Netflix never suggested it. Stupid algorithms;;
Really? I guess I would say that is a very peculiar show. I don't want to say anything about it to not spoil it for you;;
I read the premise and it sounds interesting. I've almost seen everything I have been able to find which are about special abilities, so it wierd I've never seen it before.;;
omg really? Then you are probably going to love this show!;;
Maybe, I have no clue. But now i know it's there;;
good afternoon;;
Morning everyone;;
Morning all!;;
morning <@329001373670572044>  <@311684705810513921>  <@557380058566623233>;;
how are you everyone;;
Hallo <@207416847019016202>  i am good celebrating my 21 birthday;;
Hey hello <@488734758847905803>;;
Hello <@207416847019016202>;;
Happy birthday <@329001373670572044>;;
Doing well  <@207416847019016202> you?;;
hallo <@557380058566623233> and thank you;;
haha happy birthday <@329001373670572044>;;
i remember when i was 21... long ago though...;;
im good <@311684705810513921>;;
just chilling, playing and coding a little bit;;
Nice;;
Couldn't get into coding;;
why? <@311684705810513921>;;
not your thing?;;
Yeah just wasn't good for me;;
I don't think like a coder;;
hm;;
interesting;;
im not sure though its specific way of thinking;;
Well, maybe it was also because it was java;;
I didn't mind scripting, but java did ruin coding for me;;
i code mainly in java and love it very much, but i 100% understand what you mean;;
languages like python or even javascrtipt are a lot better for people who just starting out;;
even though i started from java, but i had a lot of connected IT experience from work. so it was easier for me;;
thank you <@207416847019016202>;;
Hey <@557380058566623233> !;;
Morning everyone;;
Happy birthday <@329001373670572044> !;;

I got horizon zero dawn a while back becuse a lot of People i know told be it was amazing never finished it didnt grab my intresset;;
Haha;;
I liked horizon;;
Yet to play that game;;
i personally would give it 6/10;;
I would say 7.5, but numbers suck;;
And <@488734758847905803> would personally suck off script writer of that game, but it's not the point;;
i am more of a high fantasy/dark fantasy kinda guy when it comes to games so there arent many sci-fi games i enjoy;;
Well setting for me is never a problem, it just have to be a lot of cutscenes;;
for me the main character was also a big dislike for me;;
Why?  <@329001373670572044>;;
she just didnt intresst me;;
i usually dont care about quality of characters, but only characters ever who didnt interest me, was 4 boys from FF15;;

i m hyped for tommorow;;
For what <@329001373670572044> ?;;
for a game called outward i pre orderd it today and it will be out tommorow;;
Oh cool. That game looks really cool;;
Co op rpg;;
Hey buds;;
Have you guys been playing sekiro?;;
i want it;;
I've finally started this morning, it's been good so far. Very hard but still fun;;
good to hear tha from is still up to thier hard games;;
<@348165887347523594> my buddy has been playing it a ton and Ive been watching people stream it.;;
It is still very hard. But they mad sure it was fast and entertaining;;
he keeps texting me that he hates it and then an hour later, that he loves it lol';;
hahahaha;;
lol;;
Lol <@416803598173995018>;;
It is as hard has the souls games, but the game play is faster, so you keep going in;;
for me the souls games are sstarting to become easy;;
lol yeah thats what it seems like. I fucking hated dark souls but its fun to watch others play it. Im enjoying watching people stream it;;
I believe you <@329001373670572044> . I was a huge fan of the surge for exemple. My second game play was flawless. Just cause I got the mechanics.;;
i am right now playing the surge;;
I  think that got hooked up to the surge more than darksouls because it wasn't as dark;;
The atmosphere is different;;
i get the iron man vibe from the game;;
I can understand that;;
I really love the Surge.I can't wait to get my hands on the second one;;
Is the story good in the surge <@348165887347523594> ?;;
The story sucks <@488734758847905803>;;
Loool;;
I'll just skip it then;;
But not as bad as dark souls It's actually understandable;;
i like the story in dark souls;;
And the game play is so good, that I was able for one to wave it;;
Really  <@329001373670572044> ? I didn't understand much of dark souls story;;
Lol I don‚Äôt even know what the story is in those games. I‚Äôll check out surge, never heard of it;;
I just remember that Dark souls story was just so hard to get. And it was not intuitive at all. The surge felt so much more accessible;;
I would agree that once you get Dark souls's story and lore it's much more complex;;
thats the whole idea of dark souls story <@348165887347523594> they dont tell you the whole story but you have to puzzle it togheter from both the information of items the things that npc tells you and the enviorment;;
Yeah, got you. I did not play the full dark souls game and I had to listen to youtube darksouls lore to get the story. Which are extremely rich in content.;;
i hve played all souls games and there are still things i dont get;;
Wow. The info from items ? <@329001373670572044> ?;;
This is what pulled me away from them <@488734758847905803> ...It was too implicit.;;
I didn't know what the hell I was doing;;
yes items have a little desciption on them and it can be some thing like this 'A well-crafted sword named after the ruined land.;;
;;
Astora, before its fall, was a land replete with royal blood, and this weapon is both a reminder and heirloom of that ';;
Good job <@!329001373670572044>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
The surge was so different in that aspect;;
I always felt like I was too dumb to understand dark souls lol;;
Oh that's cool <@329001373670572044>;;
you are never too dumb to understand dark souls all you need to do is keep an eye open <@348165887347523594>;;
Yeah, probably <@329001373670572044> . It's more about what I'm looking for when I play games. I just didn't get in touch with it. Then I played bloodborne, the surge and nioh, and I loved these games;;
i love bloodborne and nioh and so far i am liking the surge;;
*i like skyrim*;;
i like skyrim too;;
I `ONLY` like skyrim;;
oh;;
Nah jk;;
I just play whatever;;
Skyrim blew my freaking mind <@!498246547838992414> . I played it when it came out. One of m fav games of all time;;
Same <@348165887347523594>;;
I like it because I can massacre people with magic;;
But, after skyrim, I don't remember one open world game that I really liked. It induced my first open world fatigue symptoms .;;
I have never invested time in a real open world game after this again. Never like I did with skyrim. Ever;;
<@348165887347523594> yeah man, same. Played countless hours of Skyrim;;
Yeah same for me, but the only open world game after skyrim I could get properly into was fallout 4;;
Yeah I think maybe fallout 4 was the next closest open world game I invested a lot into after Skyrim;;
"<@329001373670572044> that ""oh"" was hilarious omg hahahahaha";;
Lol same <@!498246547838992414>;;
Fallout 4 was lame imo;;
Couldn't get into it;;
HOW DARE YOU <@488734758847905803>;;
Jk;;
I thought it was 'aight;;
I darling dare;;
It wasn‚Äôt great but it wasn‚Äôt bad either. The story was dumb but it was fun for awhile and then it wasn‚Äôt at all lol;;
The gameplay was just so clunky;;
So bad;;
Omg the story is soooooooo bad;;
It's so bad I could've farted a better story in my shorts;;
I got fallout 4 and so many other open world games after skyrim that I never finished. I'm talking about real open world games. Not like Tomb Raider fore example;;
`doesn't say opinion over fallout 4`;;
Tomb raider is open world !;;
Lol jk;;
It's like a semi world;;
Lol <@498246547838992414>;;
Yeah;;
I personally really enjoy fo4's story and literally ALL the factions except the minutemen;;
I was not even able to finish GTA V, it's how bad it got;;
Damn;;
GTA v is really good though;;
That story man;;
Rockstar does a really good job;;
I finished Gta V's story like 3 times;;
And ignored the online;;
I know, open world fatigue <@488734758847905803> . Thing is that after skyrim I tried to play so many bad open world games that I could not take it anymore;;
Fuck the online bs;;
TRUE;;
I know what you mean <@348165887347523594>;;
Gotta take a break;;
(play more skyrim, duh);;
I played some assassin's creed games that I couldn't take anymore. I tried watchdogs which I hated. Madmax was the one that really pulled me away from open world games for sure;;
Never played mad max, and not really a big fan of AC;;
"I was like ""fuck that I'm out for sure"". Mad Max did it";;
Idk a lot about that game;;
I've seen a bit of gameplay and that's it;;
It was so boring for me. Repeating the same thing over and over. And tedious as fuck. I stopped playing it after maybe 70 hours.;;
But to each his own though;;
I'm the ultimate casual;;
Games can't grab my attention for longer than 20 hrs most of the time;;
Except skyrim and the sims 4;;
But you know what, don't take my world for it. Red dead redemption bored the hell out of me my man and I know the world loved this game;;
I have 600+ hours on the sims 4;;
I have never played the sims bro lol;;
Yeah, I don't think I'll pick up rdr2;;
Story is too long for my attention span;;
You may love RDR2 bro;;
I may;;
Well same problem for me, too long for my attention spam I guess;;
I do like country western music;;
It just bored me so much;;
COUNTRY ROOOAAADSS;;
I need to play more and watch and listen less;;
True true;;
I need a game where I can just chill and listen to music while I play;;
I got enough watching and listening in real life to deal with this in games;;
RDR2 was just tedious for me;;
I only listen to music while playing a game;;
No fun for my type of mind;;
If a game is tedious It's a big HELL NAW for me;;
Same here;;
Y'know the games I really enjoyed?;;
Saints Row;;
Love that shit;;
Few of the only games I 100%'ed;;
I heard it was extremely successful. I didn't get to play it . Maybe I would've loved it;;
Yeah it's all chaos comedy and bad-assery;;
alright;;
brb;;
I really enjoyed it because tje characters are lovable and the stories are alright for the type of game it is;;
Ok cya;;
I dont think I ever played saints row either. Im glad you feel the same way I do about RDR2 <@348165887347523594> lol. You're one of the few people I know who do;;
Saints row is pretty old now <@416803598173995018>;;
I haven't played saints either;;
I have a few cause of gamepass though;;
<@416803598173995018> I forced myself to play it for month. I hated myself for not liking it lol;;
I honestly felt relieved when I finally decided to let go. Maybe one day though. Sometimes it's just not the time;;
yeah I feel like it came out awhile ago <@!498246547838992414> yeah I felt bad about not liking it too <@348165887347523594> but only cause I dropped $60 on it lol;;
I have been wondering about if there's any interesting multiplayer games comming out Soonish? Something which would be good to play as a community;;
Something that would be satisfactory?  <@87241615671832576>;;
*minecraft* <@87241615671832576>;;
Satisfactory would be fun, but not stabil yet and Division 2 could be fun, but I can first buy it in April and I guess people are moving away. I have not been playing Minecraft for years, but ai have no clue what the appeal could be.;;
<@87241615671832576> outward comes out tomorrow;;
Co op rpg;;
Made by deep silver if I am not mistaken;;
;;
dont mind me;;
im leaving;;
Okay lol;;
Hello anyway <@558734243920871425>;;
Hahah;;
he left and didnt even say goodbye;;
did you got dms <@488734758847905803>  ?;;
Sneaky son of a bitch;;
I did <@207416847019016202>;;
is text okay?;;
Yes it is;;
True <@488734758847905803> I have been more and more interested in outward the last couple of weeks. I guess I should have wished it for my birthday as it comes out on the same day xD;;
Ohhh damn!;;
I wonder what the join and leave are for.;;
It's so I get a message when someone joins or leaves the discord;;
Hello everyone! <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:purple114Mangodongle:558775336473591810>;;
hey <@409836692158021632>;;
it was second me <@87241615671832576>;;
dobroye utro <@207416847019016202>;;
Hey <@409836692158021632>;;
Shit, I forgot to do the streamer of the week voting last week;;
Fok!;;
wadap the purplest <@488734758847905803>;;
We'll do it this week and vote for some peeps;;
Though I think almost everyone who is active has had a chance. Still a few who haven't;;
Not much <@409836692158021632> , just chilling for a bit;;
Hbu?;;
Oh I know you've turned it on <@488734758847905803> it's more that he joins just to leave. I would get it if it was a bot, but why as a person?;;
<@488734758847905803> ;;
just getting better from the flu;;
started Sekiro last night and maybe play Generation Zero tomorrow;;
lot's of stuff to look forward to this week! üòÇ;;
Ah. It was just a test to see if it worked <@87241615671832576>;;
Damn <@409836692158021632> getting the flu suuuuucke;;
genetation zero is a game i am a tiny bit intressted in simply becuse of the setting;;
Sucks*;;
Ahh okay, that makes sense;;
That person was me <@87241615671832576>;;
Thought it was a random person who joined just to leave;;
it was just a random me;;
i wanted to go with something more orangy first;;
"like ""fuck all of you""";;
damn...I can't leave this discord now without Purple finding out... üò¢;;
Lmao;;
YOU CANT <@409836692158021632>;;
youre forever here;;
also i will know;;
He'll follow you <@409836692158021632>;;
hahaha;;
And make your life pointless;;
Like a true mango;;
how about this - every person who left, will get DM from bot every hour for the rest of their lives;;
or until bot will be banned;;
that would be amazing <@207416847019016202>;;
"DM wil be like ""WHY?????? WHY DID YOU HAVE TO LEAVE OUR TREE????""";;
Lol;;
Lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
and there will be picture of crying mango;;
It has to be a GIF of a crying Mango and the mango has to become more and more desperate for every hour;;
good idea <@87241615671832576>;;
Lmao that would be hilarious;;
And then after a week or so the mango would die and there would be a tombstone;;
like tamagochi;;
i hate epic launcher;;
i take a lot of my cpu for no reason;;
Yeahh it does have it's issues. And because I've not invested any money in any games I didn't know it didn't have the possibility to buy more than one product at a time.;;
I found that kind of interesting;;
hello all;;
Hello Mr. <@312379820933906442> how are you?;;

Morning panda  <@455797717763883009>;;
hallo  <@207416847019016202>;;
sup fellers;;
*tips hat*;;
hey <@278571432588345345>;;
i got to the point when satisfactory doesnt want to upgrade tiers because of early access;;
and also it started crash for me even solo;;
wait what?;;
it was starting to stutter for me as well;;
pretty unstable apparently as you go further into it;;
now i am confused?;;
satisfactory is a game <@329001373670572044>;;
oh when you said solo i thought you were talking to me and i have never heard about that game;;
because of those early access limitations i think i will hit on pause <@278571432588345345>;;
i played really without stop;;
but if any of you will want to suffer coop again, im up for it any time;;
especially starting new game;;
yeah let's wait until it gets patched and then we can restart <@207416847019016202>;;
I also kept the save;;
"i saw they posted about crashes issue, and now in their log its like ""we didnt find why its happening but we working on solution""";;
<@329001373670572044> good morning!;;
"solo also means by yourself, or in <@207416847019016202> 's case, ""single player""";;
why only in mine? <@488734758847905803>;;
it doesnt used in english?;;
it is;;
it's fine;;
i know what solo means;;
its just that people are usuall calling me solo and i thought he was talking to me;;
btw hallo <@488734758847905803>;;
"its just <@488734758847905803>  had to  explicitly mention me, as if in ""that crazy russian"" way";;
;;
welcome <@144710265286426624>;;
Ah ok haha;;

Glad to hear it <@207416847019016202>;;

ill never get used to american politeness;;
i think its time to go home and make some streaming;;
lol nice, what game are you going to stream?;;
same;;
I actually just met someone from Moscow in the building I work. I asked him if he knew you but he didnt;;
LA Noir?;;
yeah;;
"he said he dont know me because ""orange"" in russian sounds differently";;
lol Im just kidding anyways, I did meet someone from Moscow but I didnt ask about you;;
you should;;
lol I will next time I see him. I didnt realize it but alot of Russians work in this building;;
They work for a call center to help people in customer service and they have a russian group, along with chinese, spanish etc to help translate;;
Yeah, in my building here's also a lot of russians;;
lol I would think so, seeing as you live in Russia;;
Yeah, I think living in Russia has to do with it a lot;;
lol you're a funny guy orange;;
It doesn't free me from nessecity of come up with today's stream announcing tweet;;
Which I didn't come up with yet;;
Which is kinda worries me;;
"But usually when I started stream and go to Twitter, even if I didn't come up with it before, im always like ""Oh, I got it""";;
I just read an article about Soviet science books being very popular in India, like, 50 years ago. Can this be true <@455797717763883009> ?;;
Good morning everyone!;;
Morning;;

Lol, that hurt my gastritis just reading about it <@509529130593681410>;;
LoL. Yeah, even with a healthy gut...heavy greasy food will not have your body thanking you.;;
Good job <@!509529130593681410>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
<@207416847019016202>  really? Never heard about it. maybe my grandparents would've studied;;
haha maybe <@455797717763883009>;;
im not sure its entirely true, but it was big article;;
not only about science books, but also about literature;;
Interesting. Unfortunately my grandparents aren't around anymore;;
Omg so much fucking woooooooork;;
It doesn't end;;
It just doesn't end;;
Someone, please;;

Who's feeding who?;;
We are not sure yet;;
So... Jonny is being sold into slave labor?;;
Well, he matches  <@488734758847905803> requirements;;
That's true;;
But I have a better Idea...;;
Let mango slave away at his work;;
And let <@467974634977886220> take over his channel;;
Bam!! partnered instantly;;
Good idea;;
Good morning I got a question how is ac unity on ps4?;;
Hey everyone! Hope you're all having a good one!!;;
morning  <@329001373670572044>  <@541966272561283082>;;
how are you today;;
Hallo <@207416847019016202>  i am good consemplating if I should buy ac unity or not;;
How are you?;;
it depends, what do you want from the game and what other ac did you play;;
I have played ac 2 brotherhood revelations ac3 ac black flag ac rouge ac origins;;
I am a really big fan of history so I enjoy just running around the different time periods in the games;;
I have decided I am gonna buy it;;
good decision <@329001373670572044>;;
unity imo was big step in ac games;;
even though my favourite was black flag, but imo it wasnt really ac game;;
Ac black flag is an awesome game I kinda have 3 copies of the game;;
more like russian game called corsairs (or pirates of the carribean), but made good;;
That reminds me it's been about a year since the black flag desaster;;
whats the disaster?;;
A friend I know was gonna get me ac black flag for my birthday;;
oh okay i guess that explains how you got 3 copies;;
Yup and one of don't even work;;
hm;;
Now what shall I buy next;;
<@207416847019016202> Doing better! Had a janky throat for a couple of days but it's getting better! How are you?;;
im great as always! <@541966272561283082>;;
<:gracePride:509263437436551178>;;
<@329001373670572044> buy all versions of skyrim instead;;
i dont need more then one version of skyrim <@!498246547838992414>;;
That is not true, everyone needs at least 10 copies of each version;;
i am good i got 3 copes of ac black flag and 2 mgs5 tpp and mgs5 ground zeroes;;
Good job <@!329001373670572044>, your dongle just grew to 5!;;
i will be working tommorow fun stuff;;

I should pay Mango, since I use his big server for testing my own ideas about my own bot  <@416803598173995018>;;
But of course I won't;;
lol oh ok, I was only joking. Yeah he should still pay you lol;;
That‚Äôs good! <@207416847019016202> hey! <@416803598173995018> <@557380058566623233> how‚Äôre y‚Äôall?;;
But you're right, he still should pay me. Just because why not  <@416803598173995018>;;

the standard editon is roughly 10$ and the one with all dlc is about 13$;;
Seems like its worth it, I have heard good things about those games at least;;
i am just having an hard time deciding;;
You should rather invest your money into Boney feet & Waffle irons burials AS.;;
no thank you i am good on faffles;;
I played the first one Arkham Asylum was pretty good, had a lot of fun with it. <@329001373670572044>;;

I'm rather eclectic;;
not as much as you of course;;
you used this word before, and i googled it;;
but i forgot already, it was last year;;
lol;;
it means that the person likes a variety of genres in whatever subject youre talking about;;
Also AC3 and Liberation remaster is out. And I get it with the Gold Editon for free;;
Need time to play;;
I'm an eclectic gamer - means you like many many types of games;;
gamer slut you mean?;;
AC3 was so bad though <@455797717763883009>;;
basically <@207416847019016202> hahah;;
3 more weeks and a week off for Easter. Can't wait;;

No fucking clue;;
i dont know either;;
fuck that bunny;;
I have off from 19th - 295- that's all!;;
"why AC3 was bad? it was first AC ""almost open world"" <@488734758847905803>";;
lol thats all that matter <@455797717763883009> haha;;

you mean AC brotherhood you stupid brasilian;;
*facepalm*;;
no facepalms, it should be facepunch;;
donglepalm;;
Here trying to get my stuff together so I can distant vote on the next Spanish election;;
Facedongle;;
I know that feeling <@557380058566623233> , except with brazilian elections whenever im not here;;
lol <@455797717763883009>;;
AC brotherhood and revelations were pretty bad imo;;
for me they was good, but AC3 was definitely much cooler;;
I don't have high expectations. So should be fine I guess;;
off to my sex dungeon;;
i mean;;
fok;;
work;;
back to work;;
back to fok yeah;;
Work in the sex dungeon..... ..;;
Morning everyone;;
Good afternoon  <@287320205020102667>!!;;
Whats up everyone?;;
Yo  <@416803598173995018>;;
Why is so everything so cheaper in America?;;
Hey <@455797717763883009> what do you mean?;;
Just saw that the iPad Pro is like 400$ cheaper there than here;;
Which is a month's rent for me lol;;
You pay $400 for rent? DAMN lol I pay $2400 a month;;
So rent is not cheaper in the US at least haha;;
<@416803598173995018> yeah, when you share the apartment it's cheaper haha;;
<@455797717763883009> because that is befor taxes? Don't trust me blindly on that though.;;
Nah it's tax inclusive, that's the price difference on Amazon  <@351323158826975232>;;
I mean I split with my fiance technically so its $1200 each lol;;
Damn the economics are so weird;;
Rents are expensive but utilities are cheap;;
<@455797717763883009> It might be because your country has tolls, so the company sells it for more to compensate.;;
Looks like it;;
Yeah, 21% tax ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è;;
Utilities arent very cheap where I live lol;;
Becausw you live in Hollywood? <@416803598173995018>;;
Thats alot for taxes but dont they actually go to something there? Like fixing roads and healthcare etc?;;
Yeah healthcare is free;;
I live about 30 minutes northeast of Hollywood but yeah California as a whole is stupid expensive;;
And I barely get a cold;;
ahh ok, I wish they would do something like that here with healthcare. Its such a joke in this country;;
I lived in Maryland for a while utilities were cheap but rent was a nightmare;;
It depends on what time of year here. If its summer, then electric goes through the roof because you are using air conditioning all the time;;
In Europe taxes are high but we have a lot of free stuff like healthcare and universities;;
yeah thats amazing. I would love for the US to do that;;
I would also love to live in Europe lol but thats not very easy;;
Aren't universities free there?;;
In the US?;;
I mean Undergrad at least;;
Yup;;
In the us universities are for the elite;;
Good job <@!557380058566623233>, your dongle just grew to 6!;;
God no, universities cost a fortune here;;
Damn I thought it was only for like Postgraduate studies;;
And those good enough to get a scholarship;;
hello mangoes;;
how is your day going;;
We have high school, which if you go public schools its free. Private is expensive and then you go to college (university) I went to a cheaper place and it was still about $25,000 a year even with scholarships;;

‚úå;;
Man I cannot wait for this day to be over lol;;
<@416803598173995018> I cannot wait for this week to be over lol;;
Lol yeah same. Today is just especially bad;;
I cannot wait for this waiting to last longer.;;
Hello everybody...in case anybody was wondering...I'm still alive. Thanks for reading. üòÅ;;
Staying alive or Living astray?;;
Lol <@509529130593681410> I'm in the same boat;;
I'm just about 2-4 hours away from being done. But I took a break to eat and shower;;
Hey <@351323158826975232>;;
Lol...Staying alive staying alive!;;
I want a big greasy sandwich...but can't cuz it's not my cheat day. Why do so many foods have to be so tempting!;;
Try working at a place where that's all we make. <@509529130593681410>;;
<@343707181377388544> Where do you work? Do you take pics of food? üòÉ;;
Work for a big burger chain from the south. I could and have in the past.;;
Why do you ask?;;
Cuz I love food. I love seeing pics of food. Lol. Then I fantasize about what I want to eat on my cheat days. What was your best burger?;;
Oh food porn;;
Are you a foodie?;;
Its debatable on the best burger when you can  customize anything on the menu.;;
Good job <@!343707181377388544>, your dongle just grew to 8!;;
Hope you all are having a wonderful evening!;;
Thank you <@524820041976250368> you too!;;
<@509529130593681410> you‚Äôd be in heaven where I work then lol;;
I'm what I would call a foodie. Lol.;;
Lol yeah I work at a catering company so you‚Äôd fit right in;;
Yes!  <@416803598173995018>;;
I thought that what you do called catering, but i think you never used that word;;
Woooo;;
Morning guys;;
I'm only a couple hours away from being DONE;;
I'm excited;;
what D.O.N.E stands for? <@488734758847905803>;;
Doing Overtime Now and for Eternity;;
i thought so;;
<@207416847019016202> yeah I guess that‚Äôs what you‚Äôd call it lol. We usually just say food service company too;;
is it offensive for your company in any way to be called catering? <@416803598173995018>;;
i ask because i have no idea;;
it would be 1000% easier for everybody to understand if you always used that word;;
Good morning ! Friday! Yeiiiii!  (Happy dance);;
<@207416847019016202> no, not at all;;
<@557380058566623233> good morning!;;
*happy dances and falls without skills*;;
We dont only do catering though, thats why I say food service I guess lol;;
Friday finally!!!!;;
Whats up? <@488734758847905803>;;
yo <@416803598173995018>;;
still working, hbu?;;
Lol <@488734758847905803>;;
Just got to work lol;;
pulled a muscle in my neck and cant turn my head right. I think I need to see someone at this point, it keeps happening;;
damn, i remember you said that last week i think;;
did you make any progress in octopath traveller <@557380058566623233> ?;;
Actually I did chapter 4 with everybody, think I will finish it this weekend;;
But it was a pain in the a.. week;;
what do you mean with everybody? Is it multiplayer? (i have only watched people play it so i know almost nothing abotu the game);;
yeah for me too. I'm so tired.;;
and i have one more file just like this one waiting for me on monday;;
No i think it has several different characters with own story;;
8 characters if im right;;
ohhh;;
cool;;
Oh no I meant with every character <@488734758847905803>;;
They are 8 protagonists in the game;;
Take it easy on the weekend and rest then;;
Ah true <@557380058566623233> cool!;;
do you know how many chapters there are?;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah it keeps happening man, not good. I just hate seeing doctors so much here;;
I have some stuff to do, some friends to see before i go to the states in may;;
but i will take it as easy as i can haha;;
oh damn <@416803598173995018>;;
i hate going to the doctor period;;
it's so boring;;
and takes up so much time;;
and sometimes it doesnt even solve your issue;;
yeah and here its so expensive lol. Worst part is, this weekend is my bachelor party and now I can barely move my head;;
oh fuck;;
Just 4 and the end <@488734758847905803>;;
do you think it could be your diet? LIke, i dont know, you arent eating enough bananas / potassium?;;
oh so youre so close <@557380058566623233> !;;
cause bananas help with muscle strains iirc;;
I eat a fuck ton of potassium every day. This has been happening before I was on the keto diet too;;
You seeing a therapist <@416803598173995018> that is very crucial;;
I tense my shoulders alot and hold my stress in them so its probably that honestly;;
<@557380058566623233> yeah I will call a doctor today;;
I tent t do that myself when stress. It sucks;;
TRUE;;
as we get older, stress and stuff takes a higher toll on our bodies;;
because we never learned to pay attention to that as teens or even children;;
Very true;;
I wish i had gone to a therapist years ago;;
I am very unforgiving of myself when I dont stream or write my novel;;
even if i translated for 10 hours;;
"i dont feel ""worthy"" of resting";;
"I keep guilt-tripping myself. ""You are resting? but you havent written in 5 days!""";;
so i cant even enjoy the time to relax when that happens;;
Remember that resting is part of the creative process too, if you don‚Äôt rest it gets to a point that your brain can function anymore so you are not helping if you don‚Äôt rest;;
Can‚Äôt function;;
exactly;;
try telling my subconscious that though hahaha;;
I'm working on it;;
and am already better than i was;;
Good;;
streaming has been more pressure though, because sometimes i'm afraid i'll lose followers or everything i've built;;
especially now that it's been 2 weeks basically since i've streamed;;
Don‚Äôt worry about it! Your mangos will not leave and you will built your stream up;;
haha;;
thanks <@557380058566623233> üòÉ;;
maybe i should have talked about this here before haha;;
I feel better;;
I am glad !;;
üòÉ üòÉ;;
yeah I unfollowed and unsubbed from you mango;;
üíî;;
lol just kiddingggg;;
hahaaha;;
Im surprised I have only lost 1 follower in the last few weeks and Ive only streamed like once haha;;
that's cause no one wants to miss out on that voiec when you come bac;;
back;;
lol;;
Hello by the way.;;
hey <@348165887347523594>;;
I finally got my pc where I wanted it to be. Reinstalled from scratch and apparently no more sporadic crashes . It was getting on my nerves;;
It feels brand new now;;
nice dude!;;
thats awesome;;
Hell yeah. I always pushed the time I had to do this for later. And things were getting worse and worse. Just the thought of reinstalling and reconfiguring was making me dizzy lol;;
yeah it can definitely be a pain in the ass;;
But the result is awesome. The system is clean, and I will keep it as light as possible. The fewer applications the better it is . Made a full image backup earlier so I can always go back to this state.;;
Yes indeed <@488734758847905803>;;
I will reinstall obs this weekend. I was thinking about making a fast re-run of sekiro once I'm done with that first gameplay;;
that's one of the things that bums me out if i do manage to get a new computer;;
Yeah sure;;
having to install everything;;
and setting everything up;;
It's overwhelming;;
yeah;;
it took me daaaaaays;;
to figure out how to make everything run smooth here on my laptop;;
hopefully i learned enough to avoid that;;
Yeah, I understand exactly what you mean.;;
Thing is, one should always keep resetting his pc every once a while and keep that habit.;;
yeah;;
I have been using acronis true image for a while now and it made things so much easier though. And for a while you can always go back to a state where the computer was working perfectly in no time;;
But I missed the point where things were starting to wrong and didn't know where to go back anymore. So I let things worsen for months. I'll make sure it doesn't happen anymore;;
Things got really bad when I started playing Anthem though. Those crashes have made the inevitable happen much quicker üòÖ;;
lol <@488734758847905803>;;
whats up? <@348165887347523594>;;
I never had a game that actually broke my system like this before lol;;
I heard that about anthem;;
crazy;;
Hey <@416803598173995018> , pretty good here. I'm enjoying my pc working at his best and it's awesome. How have you been bro?;;
Yeah anthem is horrible in many aspects. But the system breaking is the worse.;;
Thats awesome man! Been good, just ready for the weekend lol;;
This shit got my pc to it's knees then flat out knocked the hell out;;
Ive been crazy busy this week;;
Yeah, I could feel that you were fed up with this week's work;;
The stress is slowly growing on me as the date approaches for my new company. I need to be my best in 2 weeks. Sharp as a shark;;
lol stress and me are like symbiotic this week;;
I was saying earlier how I pulled a muscle in my neck and cant turn my head to the right, all cause of stress;;
Damn Torticollis are a bitch. It's like when a tooth hurts. Nothing works, nothing's fine.;;
And it can take days before it goes away. I don't even know what to say...I know no technics to ease the pain;;
I think I figured out what my issue is, Im contacting a shoulder and neck doctor shortly. Ive been dealing with this shit for like 5 years. I cant do it anymore;;
But maybe a chiropractor ?;;
<@416803598173995018> Damn bro, I feel you. Got to do something.;;
Maybe a chiropractor, I want to see a sports medicine doctor that specializes in shoulders first. I have specific problems and I googled them and a syndrome came right up that matches everything I have. Obviously not gonna self diagnose myself lol but this one seems likely. Might need surgery but it's pretty minor;;
dont google symptoms <@416803598173995018>;;
it's always cancer;;
loool <@488734758847905803>;;
lol <@488734758847905803> surprisingly, cancer didnt come up at all with this;;
LMAO , lol, I've done this <@488734758847905803> , and it actually makes things worse haha;;
You're body starts creating more symptoms that are even scarier;;
lol yeah exactly;;
oh you have a bad headache? totally cancer;;
lol;;
Have a great Friday, everyone!;;
Hey <@409836692158021632> you too man!;;
Hey  <@409836692158021632>;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Thanks <@409836692158021632>  you too!;;
sorry about your neck <@416803598173995018> ;;
your sexy voice is too much for your body to handle;;
dobroye utro, comrade <@207416847019016202>;;
heya <@557380058566623233> <:purple114Womango:556843876539826187>;;
lmao <@409836692158021632> thanks man;;
Im just old now I guess;;
<@416803598173995018> üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;
Im gonna try and get a chiropractor and leave work early lol. Im fucking miserable right now;;
If anyone is intersted UCI is offering an online esports management class. Here's the link: https://ce.uci.edu/areas/business_mgmt/esports/;;
Im thinking about signing up for the summer session when it opens up;;
get yourself checked out, dude!;;
and thanks for the link!;;
Oh yeah I will lol. I can barely function at work today haha;;
Looks like a new program but seems interesting and has some really qualified instructors;;
Guess who's back;;
So Pummel Party? Who's in for it?;;
whats pummel party??;;
a Mario party like game on steam;;
Don't you talk about getting old <@416803598173995018> !!! <:purple114Dongle:557311840728907776>;;
<@87241615671832576> remind me what time it is for you ?;;
it's 6 PM right now;;
oh sweet! Wish I had PC, Id be down to play <@348165887347523594> lol;;
I thought you had a PC;;
Unfortunately, no. I only have PS$;;
PS4*;;
So I can play with you tomorrow morning (my time) <@87241615671832576> . <@526319824704634881> should be able too.;;
I'm gonna get more games on PS4 and xbox one as most my friends are console people <@416803598173995018>;;
And as for competitive shooters, it would also be better. Playing with controller against people using mouse and keyboard isn't so great lol;;
It's 1pm here now <@87241615671832576> . So I could play with you on the morning or a bit later if you're available;;
I hope to available in around 3 hours from now;;
Ok, hit me up. I may be. Not sure. Gonna play sekiro now. Later <@87241615671832576> üòâ;;
Nice! <@348165887347523594> I wish they made better multiplayer games. I think my biggest issue with next gen games so far has been the lack of split screen. Every game back on Xbox, 360, ps2 and 3 was split screen. Now, I can‚Äôt play hardly any games in person with my friends;;
https://youtu.be/_yHssX9lc4E;;
This kinda confirms TLOU2 and Ghost of Tsushima for this generation right?;;
Would think so. Can not wait for ghosts and last of us!;;
Ghosts this September and TLOU2 Q1 2020 and PS5 with Death Stranding launch for Q4 2020? That'd be cool;;
Wait did they say September??;;
Did I miss that?;;
No no;;
I'm just assuming üòÇ;;
Ohh ok. Damn man! You got me all excited haha;;
Ghosts, cyber punk, final fantasy 7 and last of us 2 are the games I‚Äôm looking forward to most in the next 2 years;;
Never played FF. But CP and TLOU2 are day one purchase and play for me;;
Hopefully clear a bit of my backlog by then;;
FF is full of childhood memories for me so to have it re done is like a dream come true lol;;
But yeah I‚Äôll buy all of those day 1 as well for sure;;
Ghosts too;;
hello all;;
What‚Äôs up? <@312379820933906442> how you doing today?;;
im good my dude;;
5th day of streaming in a row;;
you never played FF <@455797717763883009> ?;;
damn;;
Yeah I haven't. Never tried it;;
Nice <@312379820933906442> wish I could stop by but I‚Äôm still at work;;
<@455797717763883009> I dunno how you can do it but you gotta play the original;;
Is it on back compat?;;
There's a remastered version (kinda remastered) of 7 and 9 on PS4 <@455797717763883009>;;
Oh, and of 10 and 10-2;;
The older ones are on steam;;
And ps3;;
What's 10-2?;;
It's the sequel to 10;;
Because they're all separate stories;;
But then 10-2 is the sequel;;
Ohh;;
That's just stupid naming;;
Agreed;;
Haha but good games I guess;;
I found the Original game on Google Play Store;;
10 is for sure;;
I only played 7, 10, 15 and 12 to the end;;
hey @everyone - shit has been weird these last two weeks;;
sorry for not being around so much;;
I will NEVER be doing what I did again;;
EVER;;
working 16+ hours for days and shit;;
it's been nuts;;
SO, if all turns out well, I might do a late-night stream today;;
Oo take care of toy;;
You;;
thanks <@314733038854602752>  üòÉ;;
I've missed streaming so much these past days;;
It's alright man. You had to do what you had to do <@488734758847905803>;;
Life is a freaking daily battle. And I guess that you have projects that you need to fulfil . Just do it my man. And prey that it pays off üòâ;;
hells yeah dude!;;
I mean;;
these projects were to pay the bills;;
so boring lol;;
but hopefully I won't have to be a translator for much longer;;
Proud of you to be able to work for that long, and that hard <@488734758847905803>, I can barely keep my attention to one small project lol;;
(also, don't mind my name, there's a story behind it...);;
God damn <@!498246547838992414> ...your name !!!;;
I vouch for you <@488734758847905803>;;
Hey <@488734758847905803> that‚Äôs ok . Obligations and family comes first, we all know that;;
lol thanks <@!498246547838992414> , it's hard. and was not healthy at all. trust me, it's no good at all hahah;;
What's the story?;;
thanks <@348165887347523594> !1;;
thanks <@557380058566623233> üòÉ;;
I appreciate that understanding from you all;;
making me leak mango juice from me eyeballz;;
Okay, the story behind my name is: 88 year old because my friends call me old because of my fucked up face, obese because of a test we had to do in gym, and it turned out that I was waayy overweight (which I am not), and Viking because I have more facial hair than all the guys in my class combined;;
(if anyone calls me old I will rooty toot shoot myself);;
You know <@488734758847905803> there are two actual mango trees on my backyard. I should send you a couple! Lol;;
Mango can't eat mangos, that's cannibalism;;
lol <@!498246547838992414>;;
damn <@557380058566623233> !;;
i love me some mangos!;;
You know you just calling yourself old right;;
I love that explanation <@!498246547838992414> lol;;
I know, and I like the meme that I am old irl for some reason <@348165887347523594> <@557380058566623233>;;
old is just a state of mind;;
I can vouch for that <@488734758847905803>;;
You can't say anything about old, with your shiny plastic face <@488734758847905803>;;
Teach me;;
lmao;;
hahaha;;
dude, when i was 18 people thought i was 30;;
cause beards;;
Same, I don't even have a beard and people say I look like fucking santa;;
hahahahahaha;;
lol;;
omg;;
they probably do that just to fuck with you;;
I think half of my class is in love with me;;
Oh boy! Lol;;
You just killed me right there hahaha;;
Oof;;
lol <@!498246547838992414>;;
Are the police coming after me now? <@348165887347523594>;;

Nope, just reeeaaally dumb <@348165887347523594>;;

I got to wait 40 more minutes to go get my kebab. I can't take this anymore;;
That's shitty lol;;
I can't eat kebab;;
So, I can relate if it's about pizza;;
For real. The meat is already on the fire but it's usually ready around 17:30. I'm starving;;
lol sleep, sex and food <@455797717763883009>;;
Why can't you eat kebabs <@!498246547838992414> ?;;
Because I can't keep it inside of me lol;;
I just throw up;;

üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;
So you can eat ham but no chicken <@!498246547838992414> ?;;
Just kebab, which is weird;;
I just can't handle kebab;;
Ok, maybe the bread, or the sauce...or just that you can only handle waffles and ham <@!498246547838992414>;;
but you can eat marrow kebaab right.;;
b o n e  kebab;;
*in low voice* here, have my bone kebab;;

And yes <@348165887347523594> I only ever eat Waffles with chocolate and chug beer while watching football;;
Damn, that's life right there;;
That's The Life of a Belgian stereotype;;
Hmmm very nice;;
Waffle with chocolate and ham;;
Lol;;
That does not sound right <@348165887347523594>;;
LOL;;
Sounds like a french christmas meal . Lots of ham and chocolate;;
Lol omg! So true;;

<@498246547838992414> You should rather just fill it with waffles.;;
Good job <@!351323158826975232>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;

But, I'm already obese apparantly <@351323158826975232>;;
Lol <@488734758847905803> sure...;;
<@498246547838992414> there is more love in a stacc of waffles, than a woman ever can contain.;;
I do love waffles;;
But I also love attention;;
And waffles aren't very talkative;;
Except me;;
<@498246547838992414> that's because you ain't crazy enough.;;
whaaaa;;
Hmmm;;
I am pretty normal and average tbh;;
Above average;;
I could live of kebabs if it wasn't so fattening;;
Love ain't got nothing on kebabs;;
I would most definitely not call you average;;
Yeah that's true  <@557380058566623233>;;
I have above average good looks;;
Yes;;
Nooice;;
<@417075583692963840> is obviously an intellectual;;
üòÇ;;
you have an above average dongle longnitude;;
Also true <@351323158826975232>;;
*#5*;;
But not for loooong;;
*dies inside*;;
Man, all that brain talking makes me even more hungry;;
I should worry;;
Imagine kebab dangling in front of you, like mango's dongle  <@348165887347523594>;;
Ho my God;;
<@348165887347523594> would lose his mind;;
That's my plan <@488734758847905803>;;
It would give me wings;;
ohh yeaaaah;;
*in geralt's voice*;;
If I take out kelly, I could kill orange easier, then I would have a much easier time slaughtering mango;;
....;;
What about me;;
üòÇ üòÇ;;
You can live <@417075583692963840>;;
Yay;;
`THIS IS NOT A JOKE` <@348165887347523594>;;
<@498246547838992414> and my axe;;
What about your axe? <@351323158826975232>;;
<@498246547838992414> wants to kill us on his way up;;
Exactly <@348165887347523594>;;
I want to be mango;;
So I kill my way to his position;;
<@498246547838992414> my axe is dripping from bear blood. It hungers for human kebab next.;;
Hehehehe;;

macaroni and cheese;;
any day of the damn week;;
ok;;
nice;;
that inspired me to create a channel;;
for food stuff;;
inspiraton comes from everyday life;;
omg;;
can you believe that the only fruit in this list: https://emojipedia.org/search/?q=apple;;
that is missing;;
is the mango;;
like, it is supposed to be there;;
but it's just an empty square;;
CURSE THEM;;
Hey! I was talking to Purple about it and he wanted me to mention it on here so I could answer questions. www.divarion.com recently became open to everyone, no teams or anything required. It's super useful and neat for streaming, finding people to raid, etc;;
yeah it is super cool!;;
@everyone - check it out;;
I wonder why it didnt go as a link...;;
weird;;
I didn't do the https://www.divarion.com ?;;
ooh nice;;
there ya go;;
Morning mangos;;
Bonjour;;
How are ya mister? <@348165887347523594>;;
Pretty good <@287320205020102667> , how have you been bro?;;
Not too bad. Not like super great. Kinda busy. Getting wrapped up in the real world. Trying to stay focused. Motivated. Etc;;
Yeah, got you. A bit the same here;;
Trying to figure out priorities is always hard, complex, confusing lol <@348165887347523594>;;
üòÖ , yeah it is. An everyday battle man.;;
Say, remind me you are a truck driver right? I think I asked before. Just want to make sure;;
Yes sir I sure am. I‚Äôm in Arkansas right now. I had to get a hotel for the night. I brought my truck into one of the company‚Äôs operating centers here yesterday morning for a preventative maintenance check. Which is basically like a checkup to make sure it keeps rolling smoothly.;;
Well turns out a lot of things were wrong with it. So it wasn‚Äôt ready until midnight so I got me a hotel room;;
In a couple hours I‚Äôll go get it. Should be done. And I‚Äôll start rolling again;;
Got all brand new tires. New windshields. Alignment. Shocks.;;
Ho alright. Damn, well I can imagine that it was a bit frustrating but in the same time a good thing;;
Nice;;
It was because sitting there I don‚Äôt make money. And then I didn‚Äôt like waiting but it would have been better if I had a better estimate of when they would be done earlier than I did. And then my company said they wouldn‚Äôt pay for a room for me earlier in the day because we thought it would be done by 7 pm. Finally I said screw yall I‚Äôll get my own damn hotel room;;
I don't know much about trucks yet. But in about two weeks I'm going to look for 2 trucks. I'm going back. I'm trying to open a freight company .;;
Damn, that sucks;;
I have a friend who is doing that right now. He has three or four trucks going at the moment;;
Two of my uncles have been for their entire lives and they keep saying that it's good business. They seem to be doing good too;;
morning all!;;
Good job <@!557380058566623233>, your dongle just grew to 7!;;
Is you friend happy with it <@287320205020102667> ?;;
Morning <@557380058566623233>;;
How are you?;;
doing great. How about you?;;
He says there is good money in it and stuff but that it‚Äôs stressful a lot and lot of hassles and responsibilities to deal with. Drivers. Equipment breaking down etc;;
Very good <@557380058566623233> , thanks. Woke up not long ago;;
<@287320205020102667> Ok. Yeah, well I guess it's the price to pay in return of the good money right?;;
Yeah. I think his problem is finding good drivers. I think he would be doing a lot better if he could find some good dependable hard working drivers.;;
I'm getting mentally ready for it.The stress a bit overwhelming right now I got to say. I'm first going to try 2 trucks. But I would really love to start with 3 of them.;;
Yeah,  I was about to say that the real issue is finding viable drivers right?;;
I already have one;;
Yeah that is one of the main issues. But that can be combated by how you treat them and what you offer to them among other things I‚Äôm sure;;
And they always say start with odd number of trucks;;
If one doesn‚Äôt do well that week the other two can help combat that;;
Some drivers only care about the pay. Some more about the benefits etc;;
Yeah, I was talking about it yesterday. I'd rather have a backup truck all the time.;;
It‚Äôs definitely a good business to get into though man. It‚Äôs solid. Always a need for business. And you have a leg up with all the experience your uncles have giving you advice and stuff like that. You will go far;;
Remember me when your company blows up and all that lol;;
Thanks for the encouragement man. Thanks a lot. In two weeks, when I'll be back in the U.S, I'm going t spend 2 weeks with one of my uncles and basically he will guide me through the numbers and all the good stuff. I expect to come up with a solid plan with concrete numbers so that the bank loans me enough for a third truck to start up with;;
I will definitely keep you up to date though üòâ;;
Who knows haha;;
Make sure to save money aside for repairs and etc. also always have plans for the future of the company;;
My friend says sometimes it takes a while to get things up  and running and take off but once it takes off sometimes shit happens fast;;
Yeah, always got to keep this in mind. Got to have enough for hic ups.;;
"I know it started as inside joke here, but I'm really thinking about calling this company ""D's Trucks"" lol";;
KellyD, Dongle Transport since 1969;;
Lol nice <@348165887347523594> !;;
Morning everyone;;
Hey <@287320205020102667>;;

Hello Waffleman ;);
Hello  <@87241615671832576>;;

But I hope your day has been *satisfactory*;;
Lol;;
I ended up playing it till oil and now I am going to wait for them to put in more stuff;;
But I have gotten a hacking game;;
Hello <@498246547838992414> , hello <@87241615671832576>;;
I've just tried Pummel party . Pretty fun;;
Yeahhsorry I was not around yesterday I got caught in some nasty fights in  company of heroes 2;;
And then I needed to go to bed because I had to be up at 4:45 to do some stage work;;
what a strange choice of name today <@498246547838992414>;;
Name?;;
yeah, crimsedate;;
kinda boring;;
"not ""slutkiller"" or anything like that";;
Hahah xXxSlutSilencer98xXx;;
üòÇ;;
Yeah, no pro <@87241615671832576> . Yesterday, I was a bit to tired to play.;;
Sorry I couldn't keep up in here. You all are too busy! lol;;
it's ok <@509529130593681410> !;;
Yeah....when I see over 100 messages...my brain goes nope! Just jump and act like you know what was going on before. lol;;
hahaha yeah I do the same usually;;
Hahaha  <@87241615671832576>;;
And, yeah <@207416847019016202> I thought I'd switch it up today;;
Same <@509529130593681410>;;
I just jump in and start ranting ;);
I have 300+ pings;;
But I just ignore them all;;
Except when orangebot dm's me;;
Haha I can't have the pings if I never follow up I just mute the channel xD I am a bad person;;
I never mute channels;;
Yeahh but we also respect the authority of that angry orange bot;;
orangebot is special yeah;;
orangebot is the man;;
I mute a lot of servers;;
because i have to;;
I need to mute a lot because otherwise my OCD will have me constantly checking and I'd never make it thru a day of work. lol;;
I don't mute them Just to show I'm popular eventhough it's mostly @everyones;;
exactly <@509529130593681410>;;
"Just to make people say ""omg you have so many pings""";;
Same here;;
im in discord api server, and theres a channel for every programming language. i got a lot of them muted;;
Haha <@498246547838992414> here's another one for the collection;;
Thanks;;

But I'm in a lot of discords as well;;

I guess so;;

which i started to play recently;;
ah vampire the masqurade a good game;;
glad to hear that you are good;;

because everyone speaking about bloodlines usually;;
but i started with first one;;
bloodlines dont know much about the first one;;
yeah;;
i never played bloodlines, will get to it after first one;;
good morning;;
even though its 3am;;
good morning folks;;
morning <@!417075583692963840>  <@278571432588345345>;;
sup;;
Good morning all!;;
h e l l o <@557380058566623233>;;
Hi <@498246547838992414>;;
Good morning everyone;;
Good morning mango seeds!;;
What's up <@311684705810513921> ?;;
Hey <@557380058566623233> ;;
<@278571432588345345> ;;
<@207416847019016202> ;;
<@498246547838992414> ;;
<@417075583692963840>;;
Good morning <@311684705810513921>  <@488734758847905803>;;
<a:jumpingmango:546688169257467904>;;
Woot woooot;;
Hey <@278571432588345345>;;
Hulllo;;
Heeeeeeeres Jonny;;
;;
Lol;;
Hahahaha;;
Just at work  <@488734758847905803>;;
Also looking at videos over Outward;;
Damn. Work on Sunday is the worst;;
How is that game so far <@311684705810513921> ? I was interested;;
Also, anyone check out opencia yet?;;
It's on gamepass and looks very cool;;
I like difficult puzzles in RPGs;;
It's fun  <@488734758847905803> but not an rpg for everyone. It has its challenges and you can easily get frustrated. The mechanics make the game great. Graphics are decent and the voice acting is limited, but if you enjoy a challenge it's fun;;
I would like to do a co-op game with someone;;
Oh I didn't know it had co-op;;
Oh, read that wrong haha;;
What game were you interested in playing?;;
Outward has co-op is what I meant XD;;
Split screen or online;;
Ah no way!;;
That's awesome;;
Yeah;;
Super rare to find a game like that;;
Are there different story outcomes based on what you do?;;
Yeah it is;;
Gone are the days;;
Yeah, there are 3 factions you can join for different game play options;;
You also don't die. Events happen instead. Like you get captured, dragged to a hyena den or saved by someone;;
There is magic, but you have to unlock mana yourself;;
4 different weather conditions that affect you, you have to watch your  hunger, sleep, thirst, etc;;
That's super cook;;
Cool*;;
Especially the events part;;
Yeah. I streamed it yesterday going to again today with a fresh character now that I know more about the game;;
Nice;;
Went in blind yesterday and that was fun, lol;;
Henlo <@488734758847905803>;;
 It has its challenges and you can easily get frustrated;;
i would say that about sekiro lol;;
"i remember playing dead space, and <@416803598173995018> be like ""dude, NOW will be terrible hard location. i thought it will be one more annoying boss fighting, and it was just puzzle";;
Lol that one part with the meteor that I said would suck, did suck haha. Took you awhile to get past it;;
Yeah but main thing that it didnt bother me <@416803598173995018>;;
"like, ""okay, we need to spend 30 minutes on puzzle, not a big deal, doing it all life""";;
but when i see somebody spending 30 minutes on boss fight - kill me please...;;
Hahaha yeah;;
How‚Äôs it going!;;
Gucci <@510594499202908160>;;
Hey <@510594499202908160>;;
Great stream yesterday but I didn't get to see the weird part :(;;
Hello mangos;;
Yo <@348165887347523594>;;
Hellooo it‚Äôs all good no worries <@488734758847905803>;;
Hey, how have you guys been?;;
Hey <@348165887347523594>  howare you?;;
Pretty good <@557380058566623233> . I'm experiencing wrist pain induced by playing too much sekiro I guess. It's hurting so much I had to take a break lol;;
Lol if only all pain was that kind;;
Yeah lol...Life would have a never lasting sweet taste to it üòÅ;;
Yep;;
Have a great day today everyone! <@488734758847905803> I‚Äôm reading your book! I‚Äôm only on page 10 but I‚Äôm enjoying it! Gotta mix it in with work and family, but I like it!;;
Happy Sunday, everyone!;;
<@348165887347523594> sorry about the Sekiro wrist pain, man! ;;
I'm at Lady Butterfly now! üòÅ;;
hey dude <@409836692158021632>;;
how are you;;
Hey <@207416847019016202> ;;
Doing good comrade! ;;
How are you?;;
im good too;;
working on some ideas about improving bot and especially bot site, and playing some vampire the masquerade when got the time;;
Oh nice;;
I'll never played Vampire. ;;
Are you gonna stream it?;;
i play first one now, which is  vampire the masquerade redemption;;
i think game is looking too ugly now;;
in all possible ways;;
so no streaming;;
but when i will get to bloodlines, maybe;;
"i like the way you said it ""I'll never played Vampire""";;
like, its infinite impossible;;
Oh sorry, haha;;
I meant I have never tried it;;
Sorry...no offense to vampires;;
i like story in first one;;
i can handle all clunkiness in control and looks just to enjoy story;;
so okay for me;;
but i get that some people would never try such and old game;;
and maybe game itself is not so ugly, but controls... ew;;
Haha;;
Wow! So retro... üòÇ;;
2000 year;;
3d games of 90s and early 00s are most challenging ones to return to;;
to play isometric old games is totally okay, especially when devs do some new high res patches, as they did for baldurs gate or planescape;;
but 3d ones...;;
i remember playin ff7 in 2009 (not even now), and wow, 3d models were shit;;
Yeah true;;
i need to clarify about controls... you can control ONLY with mouse, which is fucking terrible idea for non isometric/overhead view;;
Ps1 era games are tough to go back to;;
ff9 was a lot nicer looking though <@278571432588345345>;;
And I love ff7;;
But damn;;
Holy balls;;
Tifa's ass was a square;;
haha yeah;;
and two squares in front;;
Yeah lol;;
True ff9 was decent looking;;
and cloud had yellow square head;;
so its like with any console - devs kinda learning to make best of it to the end;;
same tech, but better looking games;;
Tifa was hot;;
yeah, in CG clips <@488734758847905803>;;
Anyone else wanna die?;;
*`I DO`*;;
so everything is as usual i see;;
It's fkn 1 am and I need to get up at 6;;
Hahaha <@207416847019016202>;;
Actually, you're not wrong there;;
lol not only in CG clips <@207416847019016202> üòâ;;
Dude but outside clips she is square... now we know more about your perverted nature  <@488734758847905803>;;
its april fools;;
"did you mean ""its april, fools""?";;
No;;
Its april fools day;;
yeah i know that...;;
Good morning!;;

They are in 2021;;
Here in europe;;

Hey <@455797717763883009>;;
Hey <@557380058566623233>;;
How's it going?;;
<@416803598173995018>  i actually prefer the change. Makes sense in terms of using maximum sunlight;;
<@455797717763883009> I'd just like to keep the times at where it is now. Like you said, you can use the maximum sunlight;;
I hate when it goes back and its dark at 1700 lol;;
Makes me tired and the days seem extra long;;
Haha i think that is to have sunrise at around 6/7 otherwise it'll be late i guess;;
Oh yeah, winters are the worst;;
Wishing it was evening for me too <@455797717763883009>  I hate Mondays  lol;;

I understand that but where do I do it ? On <#554337661704208384>;;
yes, just type commands in <#554337661704208384> channel or in ORangeBot private messages;;
Perfect thanks let me try it. Sorry to bother you with this <@207416847019016202>;;
all available commands should work in DM to bot;;
no no, im glad that somebody is interested <@557380058566623233>;;

I have to add my real name and stuff;;
by the way guys, check out most convinient feature so far;;
!botdm;;
To enable bot DMs when you mentioned, type *!botdm enable*. To disable, type *!botdm disable* <@207416847019016202>;;
bot DMs you everytime somebody mention you;;
it was convinient for me so far;;
and for some other guys here;;
and girls;;
yeah that feature is the bomb;;
I think I started a revolution <@207416847019016202>;;
and remember - if somebody is too shy to spam in <#554337661704208384> , you can always DM bot, all commands should work there too (it will work for every server you and bot are in);;
Lol;;
haha yeah <@557380058566623233>;;
How do yo do directs messages to someone? Like the bot? <@207416847019016202>;;
<@557380058566623233>;;
The bot should've messaged you now;;
yeah;;
He did;;
you can write commands there;;
in your chat with bot;;
Yeah, I use that if I forget who people are, like mango;;
you cant use mentions in DM, but you can get info writing name without @;;
and if you do it in dm, you got server avatar;;
Ok;;
What if I want to ask you something and don‚Äôt want to bother everybody?;;
Not that I am going to do it don‚Äôt worry lol;;
I am just figuring this think out <@207416847019016202>;;

I mean direct messaging;;
you can dm me too;;
Ok how do I do that ? Do you have to be on my friends list?;;
click on my photo;;
then on my other photo;;
youll see my profile;;
after that - some dots;;
"and ""message"" button";;

*skyrim is the best game ever made, after hentai shooter 3D*;;
That's an actual game lol;;
I wanted to buy it as a joke, but I do not want that in my steam library lol;;

Buuut people know me as Crims so Idk;;
Yeah <@416803598173995018> I think that's smart;;
Yeah I'm kinda in the same boat. Not like Im huge or anything so I dont think a name change will make a difference;;
I basically went with the meme and made everything waffle themed;;
<@197881756844556288> did it flawlessly <@416803598173995018>;;
Nobody even noticed;;

Do you actually eat a lot of waffles ??;;
Hell no <@510594499202908160>;;
I never eat waffles actually;;
I just say I love them for the meme;;
I wish I had some fluffy waffles <:tinyte2WRY:549245460443824130>;;

Don't speak about fight club;;
Idk, never seen it;;
I hear ya <@416803598173995018> ;;

And some of us (at least me) should be on a diet, but are not. So let's talk about.... burgers!;;
Omg;;
_leaves _;;
Waffles amirite;;
Also, discord is racist;;
There is a pancake emote, but no waffle one;;
<:HappyWaffle:554837206045294614>;;
Flex with your *nitro* <@207416847019016202>;;
<:helYea:236243426662678528>;;
ü§ë;;
Dam I missed what could have been a  burger conversation  <@207416847019016202>;;
everything can be a burger conversation if you are brave enough.;;
Its never too late for burgeg conversation;;
Where do you go for your burgers?;;
ideally i prefer all those non cheap non fast food burgers places, which is basicall not chains, just separate burger cafes/restaurants;;
but since i dont like much to go to any kind of cafe, i mostly eat burgers in fast food;;
meaning, mcdonalds;;
since wendys closed in russia;;
but wendys my favourite;;
but man, if you make your own burgers you can put butter on 'em.;;
why would i add butter?;;
i made own burgers once, too much time consuming for me;;
to smoothen your buns.;;
Buttered buns are delicious;;
I think what makes burgers fun is that you can put anything on it different meats, cheeses, condiments , toppings and buns;;
but it all has to fit within your conquering mouth.;;
Not true you just need to have a plan of attack, biggest one I had was a 3lb. 12 patty burger;;
Good morning!;;
Hey <@502171199850414081> !!;;
Congrats! That's amazing progress;;
Best thing to put on a salad cheeseburger: pineapple. A huge slice of a pineapple;;
Morning <@557380058566623233> !;;
Holy shit <@343707181377388544>  a 12 Patty burger?;;
Oh God! We are talking burgers! I better leave now, I am trying to loose weight myself, lol;;
Are burgers that bad for your weight?;;
It's salad and protein, and except for the buns, there aren't any super carbs;;
<@488734758847905803> yup once ate a 6lb Chicago style  pizza then went into a food coma after;;
I guess it depends right? How greasy they are;;
Holy shit hahaha;;
Yeah that's true <@557380058566623233>;;
True and the meat and how lean it is;;
<@467974634977886220> makes some really good homemade burgers;;
Exactly;;
Bacon and bbq sauce on a burger is tue best;;
Good job <@!417075583692963840>, your dongle just grew to 6!;;
*the;;
Homemade are nice;;
I do like BBQ sauce;;
Bacon;;
BBQ sauce is da shizzle;;
Mmmm bacon cheeseburger my favorite;;
Ooh;;
I like bacon;;
Now i want a burger;;
Same;;
I always want a burger;;
TRUE;;
*Borgers ar good*;;
Please! Is 0918 here I can not have a burger! Lol;;
*have one anyway* <@557380058566623233>;;
Do you know whats better;;
Hahaha;;
Waffles;;

NO;;
Waffles;;

Lol;;
<@!498246547838992414>  definitely;;

Lol I just realized what you did with your name <@!498246547838992414>;;

Lol;;
Frick that shit;;
This is literally the worst song in the world;;
lol.. my 6 year old bought minecraft for her tablet... and a few other things.... fml;;
How big is the damage? <@111826600395378688>;;
not bad really but she's playing it off like someone else did it...;;
I would maybe believe her... but she's a only child.. wtf;;
Oh, at least there isn't a hole in your wallet;;
yea... unlike the mess that I uncovered a few years back with my brother-in law...;;
Lok <@111826600395378688> damn;;
What?;;
Did your bro in law steal from you?;;
Or did he get stolen from?;;
wife's brother who was 6 at the time bought like 800$s worth for some android game;;
My nephew bought 500‚Ç¨ worth of ps4 games one time, he didn't know he thought they were free because his mom's credit card was being used;;
it was on his father's account;;
Wow that is nuts! <@111826600395378688>;;
"he showed it to me as well. he was like ""look I can get all this free stuff from this website""";;
Damn <@111826600395378688> $800;;
I told them they were getting bent sideways and the put a stop to it.. not sure if he likes me anymore;;
they*;;
Dayuuuuuumn;;
Oh shit;;
they had just got the last month's bill which was another 700 and they were trying to figure out where the charges were coming from fro. bthat as well...;;
Jeez dude;;
That's a lot if it's gonna be every month;;
yea I felt sorry for them... that's why you don't give a kid access to a phone/tablet with your info on it...;;
yup;;
now I'm dealing with my daughter.. it wasn't that big but it'd the principle of it..;;
it's*;;
Yeah, so she won't do it again, even by accident;;
she's trying to play it off as if she didn't do it and someone else did...;;
Oof;;
who the fuck else did it?! LAWL the ghost that lives under your bed?;;
I said that without the fuck in the sentence..;;
*santa did it*;;
Lol;;
even the Lawl... I said Lawl...;;
My mom isn't as nice as you then;;
bahaha;;
oh, lets do crims mom jokes;;
....;;
Okay? <@207416847019016202>;;
ugh too pissed to even stream now... yikes;;
Good job <@!111826600395378688>, your dongle just grew to 6!;;
*Yikes*;;
Hmm...;;
Crims' mom is so big, she nearly squashed me in bed.;;
You need capital punishment <@111826600395378688> : no more Minecraft till she tells the truth!;;
Videos of parents shouting at kids seem to do well on youtube <@111826600395378688>;;
ooooooooof <@351323158826975232>;;
lol  <@498246547838992414>;;
I try not to but how the hell are you gonna survive in life if you break down at the sight of someone yelling at you...;;
Exactly;;
Crims' mom is so stupid, she thought waffle was spelled: *pancake*;;
If I could yell, I'd shout a lot more at my stupid dog;;
Big oof again <@351323158826975232>;;
ü•û;;
^ death;;
Death to the cakes of Pan;;
Hahahahaa;;
I mean they are just so much better than waffles and theyre easier to make soooo;;
Chocolate chip pancakes OP;;
waffles are good once in awhile but I could eat pancakes every week;;
/ban <@416803598173995018>;;
DO IT! YOU WONT;;
I can't;;
I'm not powerful enough;;
Also, I'm doing a creative writing assignment and I'm just taking the piss lol;;
This story is dog shit;;
<@498246547838992414> you challenge is to put the word guava inn somewhere cheesy.;;
ooo creative writing, I would fail that class so quickly lol. My creativity is probably in the negatives at this point lol;;
you can do as my friend does. Write everything in irony.;;
Good morning all! Rushing for work. Ugh! I need to start being a morning person.;;
It never happens <@509529130593681410> , you either are or you aren't;;
I've always been a morning person;;
I wake up and am instantly down to talk;;
And to do stuff;;
Unless I sleep less than 7 hours;;
Which in that case, fuck everybody for the first few hours;;
But sorry you're rushing to work haha;;
haha;;
Sounds relatable, if I don't get enough sleep people should not come near me;;
<@488734758847905803> I couldnt be more opposite lol. Don't talk to me in the morning, dont even look at me lol. At least until I have had my coffee;;
and that sounds like my wife.;;
Lol <@416803598173995018>;;
I get up fast and ready to talk and have fun and she' not so interested before a couple of hours later;;
I'll be on you like purple on mango;;
Joker trailer ;;
https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1113437750806568960;;
not sure how I feel about this;;
It looks genuinely good but for some reason, Im just not interested;;
I could be interested, but that's mostly because of Pheonix and to see how he would handle such a role.;;
yeah that will be interesting for sure;;
Looks like he will do a good job from the trailer at least;;
I kinda hate Joaquin Phoenix;;
Like a lot;;
why do you hate him?;;
I dont know;;
he bothers me;;
There's something off about him;;
ah ok. I get ya;;

Just be prepared to die in sekiro;;
Yeah lol;;
I played the division 2 beta and hated it lol. Haven‚Äôt played sekiro though so basically, I can offer no help haha <@557380058566623233>;;
Lol <@416803598173995018>  didn‚Äôt like it not even a little?;;
Nope lol. Played for about 30 minutes and hated every aspect of it and I love shooters. Everything just seemed bad to me. The mechanics, inventory system, shooting wasn‚Äôt fun either. It was just kind of repetitive but that‚Äôs just me;;
Wow;;
I am not to big on shooters but I liked the first one;;
Hard choice <@557380058566623233> at first. I enjoyed the division 1 a lot even though I was playing it alone as well. But I think that as a whole, for a single player. Sekiro is the number 1 choice.;;
Yeah that is what I think as well <@348165887347523594>  I just don‚Äôt know how much fun I will have dying all the time lol;;
I only got the division last year at it's finest state. I played about 2 months of it or 3;;
I didn‚Äôt play the first one so maybe that had something to do with it too;;
Maybe <@416803598173995018>;;
Yeah sekiro would drive me crazy lol;;
Exactly lol;;
Good job <@!557380058566623233>, your dongle just grew to 9!;;
<@557380058566623233> Sekiro is lots of fun but yeah. You will die a lot...a whooooole lot;;
Oh already 9, cool;;
Damn, they grow so fast;;
Lol yeah my friend texts me every day how much he loves it and then minutes later he texts back saying how much he hates it lmao;;
I can get a little frustrated with that <@348165887347523594>;;
lmao <@416803598173995018> so true;;
Lol;;
I don't know, I have a hard time spending the money on the devision though. I've heard saying that the campaign is still bad or worst than the fist one;;
I actually enjoyed how the story was implemented and told in the first one though;;
The thing is that in shooters how much do you really play for the campaign right?;;
Yeah true. Well, in my case, the campaign/story is as important as the gameplay;;
No story no good for me;;
I vote for Sekiro <@557380058566623233> but I'm super biased. ;;
I love that game so much. üòÇ;;
I know what you mean. I like story driven games the most;;
Lol thanks <@409836692158021632>;;
lol <@409836692158021632> , that's cause sekiro is awesome really;;
I think I will go Sekiro first;;
It will take me forever to finish;;
Lol;;
I was hoping for the division 2 to address the lack of story it had in the first  one. If it was the case, I would've jumped into it in a heart beat. But it's not though;;
Yeah <@557380058566623233> lol;;
I've been playing sekiro like crazy for more than a week, and I'm not sure how far I am. Right now it's really really hard lol;;
I think a good shooter /story will never happen <@348165887347523594>;;
It baffles me though. Borderland 2 nailed it back then;;
I just bought it on sale on steam for 10 euros;;
I never played borderland;;
Wasn‚Äôt into shooters back them;;
Not that I am now mind you;;
I'm watching jonny's stream as we speak. He is playing it;;
Lol me too;;
Guys thanks for the help!;;
haha, I always loved me shooters like halo, older COD's and all, but never been fan of looter shooters though;;
No pro <@557380058566623233> , enjoy your purchase;;
Yeah there is a difference;;
Thanks!;;
If I had to pick one shooter, it would probably be halo. Me and my best friend have probably played thousands of hours of that game at this point;;
Never played <@416803598173995018>  I wasn‚Äôt into shooters when it came out;;
Ahh ok. I think they are re doing it for Xbox 1 and pc. Wish I had either so I could play it again;;
My 360 broke last year, but I find that just playing backwards comp games is not a good excuse to buy it;;
<@557380058566623233> I used to think the same;;
I'm so glad I finally got an Xbox 1;;
Gamepass is so cool;;
There are so many options;;
And I get to play games I didn't have a chance to;;
That will be a good reason if your internet is good <@488734758847905803>;;
Mine sucks big time;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah that is sweet;;
Hm. I don't understand <@557380058566623233> , are you talking about downloading the games because they are digital?;;
That‚Äôs probably the thing I‚Äôm most grateful for, my internet. I pay a decent amount but it‚Äôs damn good;;
Among other things <@488734758847905803>  latency and stuff;;
My speed is 3Mps;;
So imagine;;
Hm. I see. So you never buy digital games I guess;;
Yeah that would really suck;;
Never;;
Just to download a dlc of 5 or 8 GB can take me like 9 hours;;
I am dreading that 50 go download from the division;;
hahahha;;
5 day download;;
Yep;;
Geez;;
Where are you at <@557380058566623233> that the mbps is that low?;;
I live in the Dominican republic;;
A little island on the Caribbean;;
We do have faster internet but is pretty expensive <@416803598173995018>;;
Ahh ok. I have friends from there;;
Cool;;
Lol yeah it‚Äôs kinda funny. She looks black but speaks Spanish fluently so every time she speaks Spanish in front of someone that doesn‚Äôt know her, they get super confused;;
Lol yes we are pretty mixed here, you can find Dominicans from any race;;
<@416803598173995018> - did you see this BS about apex?;;
it can break your console;;
be careful;;
üëÄ;;
Morning guys..;;
Yeah..I heard from Medusa that apex is broken..don't play/update Apex;;
Magandang Umaga, <@526319824704634881> üòÅ;;
Hey there <@409836692158021632>! Using the pinoy ancient language I see...;;
hahaha;;
Kumusta <@409836692158021632> ?;;
ayos lang...eto, trabaho...;;
doing good, Kat!;;
I finally saw the movie Hereditary yesterday... ;;
üëÄ;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah I saw, just saw that it was fixed so hopefully should be good now;;
what is with games breaking consoles? lol;;
hahaah;;
right;;
it sounds so contradictory;;
Respawn messed up with their update and player accounts were sent to the wrong servers that didn't keep their game progress. ;;
That dude who deployed to the wrong server is probably fired now üòÇ;;
more then likely Lawl;;
https://youtu.be/kUopKcRLNGA?t=600;;
anthem fucked up hard as well;;
yeah, that Kotaku article on Anthem was mind blowing;;
I've never heard of such  insane practices in videogame development...;;
Looks like Angry Joe is just repeating what was in the article;;
But pointing to the wrong server is nowhere near half as bad as what Bioware did...;;
it's gonna be a very very tough road to redemption for them...;;
;;
Welcome <@562771486171987996> üòÅ;;
hey <@562771486171987996> !;;
thanks for joining us under the mango tree;;
<@409836692158021632> - in my opinion, bioware is just going to be forgiven if they fire everyone;;
Welcome <@562771486171987996>;;
That is so not happening <@488734758847905803>;;
yeah i dont think so either <@557380058566623233> haha;;
it's a shame because bioware had amazing games;;
or have I guess I should say;;
they still exist;;
I loved them yes;;
but it's kinda like square enix;;
it's a name that is starting to lose credibility as well;;
<@488734758847905803> haha;;
imo, the only way to find redemption with their fans/player base is to produce a really really good game (dragon age 4?);;
higher ups within bioware will probably not get fired (just like what happened with Riot);;
they're gonna go into heavy PR fix mode tho...;;
final fantasy 15 fell hella short;;
what happened with riot?;;
do you mean the creators of LoL? <@409836692158021632> ?;;
Agree <@488734758847905803>;;
And yes <@409836692158021632> it all depends of the next Dragon Age;;
Kotaku released an article about the sexism within Riot and how horrible it is to work at;;
or a new mass effect game possibly?;;
oh shit really?;;
i didnt hear about that;;
that's crazy;;
"yup...Riot is now synonymous to ""bro/sexist"" culture";;
That‚Äôs nuts;;
now i'm even gladder that i stopped playing that game;;
I don‚Äôt think we will see a Mass Effect any time soon <@488734758847905803>  shame because is my favorite all time games;;
damn... ;;
i actually never played any of them, but have heard about the story from a friend of mine;;
was thinking about streaming them now that I have an xbox1;;
You kidding?;;
They are fantastic;;
Controversy and all. They are one of the best trilogy out there;;
My buddy interviewed  with riot and said the campus was awesome but it was basically like a frat house there lol;;
I am not <@557380058566623233> - I always wanted to play them but they are so long and there are so many other games;;
damn <@416803598173995018>;;
that's f'ed up;;
Oh wow <@416803598173995018>;;
i have a friend who worked with their customer service here in brazil;;
and siad it was the opposite;;
well;;
not the opposite;;
but he said that there were lots of different people there;;
yeah, you should definitely check out Mass Effect <@488734758847905803>;;
and they all got along;;
BUT;;
it is brazil;;
They are not that long to be honest, of course you have to play them all to follow the story;;
Maybe it‚Äôs just US then? This was at the LA office;;
right. I would want to do that;;
I wonder if andromeda is any good now that the bugs are fixed;;
I enjoyed it but it is not at the level of the others really;;
The gameplay was the best though;;
<@416803598173995018> US and UK Riot locations I believe from what I remember;;
A UK cosplayer who got hired by Riot had similar stories and they were all very very disgusting...;;
But as a story not even close;;
That‚Äôs really sad isn‚Äôt it? <@409836692158021632>;;
damn that is bad;;
Ahhh ok. That‚Äôs too bad <@409836692158021632>;;
I‚Äôve applied for them dozens of times but never heard anything;;
true <@557380058566623233>;;
it is truly sad <@557380058566623233> ;;
that the company with arguably the most popular videogame in the world runs their shop like that...;;
<@416803598173995018> I thought of applying to them before as well but after the article came out, they're a big NOPE from me...;;
even their interview practices are horrible...;;
Yeah I haven‚Äôt applied since my friend interviewed.;;
Better places to work out there;;
<@409836692158021632>oh trust me I know... they were hoping for a extension but nope...;;
ea waited 7 years for a game...;;
<@111826600395378688> yeah;;
that article pretty much cancelled Bioware for me;;
Lawl yup;;
I told myself I'd wait a week;;
it'll be interesting to see if Bioware will be at E3 this year...;;
buy it but I didn't do that at all Lawl and ppl say they hate it when I get political when it comes to games;;
they won't;;
I was definitely all set to buy Anthem too;;
"I thought with all their subtle ""this is not like Destiny"" talk that they would've learned from Bungie and do something better...";;
but then they did zero research on Destiny and that you couldn't even mention Destiny when talking about their game? ;;
that is absurd!;;
yeah, I bet they won't be at E3 either;;
they'll resurface when they have something to show for DA4;;
TRUE;;
I was set to buy it as well;;
I was super disappointed;;
I really wanted just the story to be good at least;;
I have it but haven‚Äôt opened yet;;
I know right!;;
Lol I want to wait a bit. I really love BioWare but I think I will be disappointed;;
if you do, please let us know what you think;;
I will of course;;
üòÅ;;
if i share something with you guys;;
promise not to judge me?;;
üôÑ;;
üëÄ;;
No judgment here  <@488734758847905803>;;
We wont judge;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwRtyv6-8vs&t=740s;;
this is one of my favorite asmr's;;
"and the title is ""applying make up to the bride""";;
but i SWEAR it's just because of the sounds she makes;;
....;;
and not  that I feel beautiful when she puts the make up on;;
*trying not to judge* thats great;;
lmao;;
Hahaha;;
ASMR is fine dude;;
I thought it was gonna be something serious... üòÇ;;
hahahah;;
lol if it's serious you'll know;;
You know I actually find those noises attractive <@488734758847905803>;;
theyre really nice to hear, arent they?;;
Yep;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw3BNSZf8zk;;
i really like this one too;;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86BMT1ZdM7Y&t=640s;;
this one too;;
It makes you want to make the noises yourself;;
yeah exactly haha;;
i love sleeping to these sounds;;
Wow I just found Mutant Year Zero is coming to the switch;;
Cool;;
nice;;
<@207416847019016202> did you say you liked Rammstein?;;
Lol no I didn't  <@416803598173995018>;;
And I'm glad that  <@488734758847905803> will learn how to properly apply make up;;
Morning mangors;;
<a:jumpingmango:546688169257467904>;;
morning;;
how are you;;
Not bad dude;;
And you?;;
<@416803598173995018> I liked du hast;;
to be fair probably the only one I've heard;;
im good, i spent almost hour reading that kotaku article about anthem;;
Yeah interesting;;
Well i lied about an hour, because i still fucking didnt finished it;;
huge but veeery interesting;;
"some of parts of that interview are like ""really???""";;
especially all that looks silly comparing to stories about cyberpunk being in playable state several months already;;
Good morning all!;;
Mornin';;
morning all!;;
Morning  <@557380058566623233>  <@417075583692963840>  <@111826600395378688>;;
Hey <@207416847019016202> I also read that article and couldn‚Äôt believe it. Nuts;;
I agree  <@557380058566623233>;;
There s so much little things that nobody should do in their work;;
"All that ""nobody made decisions""";;
Fuck, wherever I worked, I knew that decisions just need to be done;;
They basically wasted 4-5 years;;
Amazing right?;;
Also all those tensions between different teams surprise me a lot;;
youre fucking developers, you should know how to cooperate between different teams;;
"without that pathetic nonsense like ""2nd team who had online experience, tried to explain 1st team what they do wrong in online, but 1st team wat in charge and didnt care""";;
wtf... is this kindergarden or development?;;
well from other point, i have some experience in IT, and i can say that a lot of what people do during developement or QA or fixing things, is really stupid;;
How so?;;
like, lets pretend, you are big company, and you have this software, and something breaks;;
Ok;;
and you wait some tech guys to fix it;;
and lets say it took 4 hours to fix;;
and you can think that all 4 hours they really worker hard;;
Of course;;
but in reality (i dont say that somebody is lazy) most of that time was support person tried to reach someone more competent, and then to wait when that person will be able to start fixing, and after hour of waiting will realise that person didnt start fixing because they didnt undersand it was so important to do right now;;
Ok;;
and when they understand, they started to say that everything okay and it took support person another 30 mins to explain that problem is there;;
and so on and so on;;
what im trying to say is, there is a lot of stupid pointless interactions;;
I understand what you mean, is crazy;;
when it could take like 20 minutes for someone to fix it, it can take several hours for team to cooperate and fix it;;
morning guys;;
For what I understood most of that problem comes from the engine they are using right?;;
hey <@207416847019016202>;;
hey <@557380058566623233>;;
and from what i read, there was a lot of second example...;;
Morning! <@488734758847905803>;;
morning <@!417075583692963840> , <@111826600395378688> <@278571432588345345> and <@442488674144223242>;;
Agree <@207416847019016202>;;
from what i read, i would say it were 2 big problems - engine and clueless leadership <@557380058566623233>;;
hey <@488734758847905803>;;
Yes sounds about right <@207416847019016202>;;
are you guys talking about Anthem?;;
Hahahaha yes;;
yep we are;;
about that schreiers long article;;
yeah I read some of that;;
really interesting to find out what went behind the scenes;;
that is FUCKING long, but it worth to finish;;
Is nuts that for sure;;
"after reading 30 mins, you can think that you basically got the idea. but after another hour of reading you are like ""wtf, thats new""";;
really?;;
damn;;
I need to get back to it then;;
well maybe some people will finish it faster then 90 minutes, but it took me really long because i read while eating and playing;;
cause I did only read for about 20-30 minutes haha;;
true true;;
I also read it while doing stuff;;
I'll limit myself to that;;
Jesus christ, that's loooong;;
i agree, that is mini book;;
I couldn't be bothered;;
It was very interesting.;;
well theres nothing about skyrim in the article;;
Hmmm;;
Nothing good then;;
I don‚Äôt like the guy very much, but you have to agree his articles are very accurate;;
"If they're all so long, it's a big ""hell naw"" from me";;
why dont you like him <@557380058566623233> ?;;
Don‚Äôt like his attitude.;;
I mean he is good at what he does, but humility is a virtue he doesn‚Äôt have lol;;
ah i see;;
one thing is for sure after this whole thing though;;
we have to watch for when these developers (not the developer studio) write / develop a game;;
I won't be r elying on names anymore like  bioware or square enix;;
if the people who comprise that team arent the same ones who did a good job in the past;;
i am not getting excited for it;;
hes a dick <@488734758847905803>;;
TRUE;;
there was big rant between him and YongYea,  and YongYea was maximum nice, and schreier was just rude and agressive;;
<@!498246547838992414>  , just read this part - ;;
The story started changing drastically, too. In early 2015, veteran Dragon Age writer David Gaider moved over to Anthem, and his version of the story looked a lot different than the ideas with which they‚Äôd been experimenting for the past few years. Gaider‚Äôs style was traditional BioWare‚Äîbig, complicated villains; ancient alien artifacts; and so on‚Äîwhich rankled some of the developers who were hoping for something more subtle. ‚ÄúThere was a lot of resistance from the team who just didn‚Äôt want to see a sci-fi Dragon Age, I guess,‚Äù said one developer. Added a second: ‚ÄúA lot of people were like, ‚ÄòWhy are we telling the same story? Let‚Äôs do something different.‚Äô‚Äù
;;
When asked for comment on this, Gaider said in an email that when he‚Äôd started on the project, Anthem design director Preston Watamaniuk had pushed him in a ‚Äúscience-fantasy‚Äù direction. ‚ÄúI was fine with that, as fantasy is more my comfort zone anyhow, but it was clear from the outset that there was a lot of opposition to the change from the rest of the team,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMaybe they assumed the idea for it came from me, I‚Äôm not sure, but comments like ‚Äòit‚Äôs very Dragon Age‚Äô kept coming up regarding any of the work me or my team did... and not in a complimentary manner. There were a lot of people who wanted a say over Anthem‚Äôs story, and kept articulating a desire to do something ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô without really being clear on what that was outside of it just not being anything BioWare had done before (which was, apparently, a bad thing?). From my perspective, it was rather frustrating.‚Äù;;
Gaider left BioWare in early 2016‚Äî‚ÄúAs time passed, I didn‚Äôt feel keen to play the game that I was working on,‚Äù he told me‚Äîwhich led to new writers for Anthem and a total story reboot. This led to even more chaos. ‚ÄúAs you can imagine, writing for BioWare sets the foundation for all the games,‚Äù said one developer. ‚ÄúWhen writing is unsure of what it‚Äôs doing, it causes a lot of destruction to a lot of departments.‚Äù;;
hm;;
They are not what they were;;
I dont know any of these people by n ame;;
fuck;;
really?;;
Yes I remember <@207416847019016202>;;
yeah;;
you dont know jason schreier, most famous game journalist?;;
for a long t ime I didnt really keep up with this part of the gaming world;;
nope;;
which journalist you know then?;;
by  name?;;
yeah;;
the ones you just mentioned now haha;;
other than that, none;;
unless you count karak as a journalist;;
well YongYea is just another big gaming youtuber, a lot of people doesnt know them... but jason schreier is kinda kotaku superstar;;
What boggles the mind is how the hell you do not have a vision of what your own game is for 4 years come on!;;
no, i count youtubers as youtubers <@488734758847905803> ;;
YongYea goes in same category;;
or bloggers, or whatever;;
yeah thats what I count t htem as well;;
Also I always read Game Informer;;
i dont read anything, shreichers big article is exception;;
i prefer to listen it on youtube;;
while doing something;;
I see;;
so to read that i had to take away my morning IT news reading in train;;
and after that my lunch IT news reading;;
and after that READ AT WORK, which i never do;;
Lol;;
usually at work i work, play or code sometingh for me;;
You work IT right?;;
yep;;
Cool! That is a mystery for me, don‚Äôt understand anything about it. Lol;;
lol, its okay;;
it was mistery for me too, it just happened that way for my career;;
Cool. That think is like magic lol;;
as i said earlier, within magic theres a lot of shameful stupidity too;;
so to be honest im not really surprised by the article;;
"im more like ""wow, okay""";;
That happens everywhere really;;
everywhere generally, and everuwhere in IT, yes;;
Lol;;
Good job <@!557380058566623233>, your dongle just grew to 10!;;
but some people manages to create game and release it without bugs;;
and some - not;;
I guess it all depends of your work ethics and definitely good management;;
management is most important in any kind of business, so yeah, of course;;
and i dont even mean all those top executives;;
local mangement matters a lot too;;
which this article shows good;;
Yes agree;;
I dont think i'll be buying any EA games anymore;;
until they fix this shit;;
not anthem;;
but their ideals;;
Is a shame really BioWare we‚Äôre one of my favorites devs ever;;
true...;;
maybe they can leave EA;;
though now that team isnt even the bioware that made dragon age or ME;;
so, maybe those writers can get jobs at actually decent places;;
According to the article one of them left and took a bunch of people to a new studio;;
<@207416847019016202> ahh ok, I thought for some reason you said you liked them. They just released a new song for the first time in awhile. <@442488674144223242> love that song! Workout to it all the time;;
i dont think that its about bioware ideals, its more about quality of product that now they able to do;;
and judging by last 2 games, its not the best quality;;
of course you can say that big evil EA make them drop rpgs and start making monetized looter shooters;;
but for example, AC odyssey basically had pay to win, and it still was a great game for me;;
"so ""ideals"" didnt affect quality much in that example";;
Not knowing what your own game is about for 4 years it is not a EA prerogative is a BioWare problem they are the ones who are making the game;;
exactly <@557380058566623233>;;
only thing that EA really made them do, is use frostbite;;
not bioware <@207416847019016202> , but EA.;;
with their lootbox shit, all they do is think about money;;
well you go read article and you will understand that not EA bad ideals broke the game;;
but bioware shitty develompent process;;
also it was with andromeda;;
i dont defend EA, but in this case their ideals (that will neve change, and i hope they will die) dont matter so much as bad development process;;
It was an eye opening article;;
yeah;;
Absolutely;;

Can someone @ everyone? Twitch has changed their settings to allow Affiliates to customize their Cheer Badges! As you all surely know, this picture is the current loadout. We have any artists in here üòú;;
<@535295021482508299> this just made my dongle go up;;
<@!498246547838992414> hahaha it's great news indeed!;;
I'm gonna enjoy myself with these hehehehe;;
I have no artistic talent whatsoever but I;;
will think of something;;
haha;;
I was just about to post that!;;
<@409836692158021632> haha I am victorious!;;
Cheer badge for 0 bits.;;
@everyone !;;
Thanks for sharing <@535295021482508299>;;
That's awesome and it took them long enough;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah I'm loving the expansion on the Affiliate program;;
I'm not a fan of the sub points tho;;
What‚Äôs sub points?;;
each subscription is equivalent to a sub point;;
when you get 15 subs, you unlock a 2nd tier 1 emote slot;;
so you'll need 15 sub points to unlock that 2nd emote;;
if your sub points go below 15, that 2nd emote is no longer accessible;;
Ahh ok. Yeah I don‚Äôt like that either at all;;
so you have to keep those 15 subs;;
I would rather have it unlock after reaching 15 subs;;
and it stays unlocked even if your sub numbers drop below 15;;
Yeah exactly. That makes sense. I wonder how many people feel that way too. Maybe they will change it;;
Twitch has a lot of these little things and achievements floating around to keep you hooked and streaming;;
Lol yeah seems that way;;
Won‚Äôt matter when we are all partners though and making millions!;;
hahaha;;
<:Fight_Club__Soap__112_x_112_2:548527685932941362> <:Fight_Club__Soap__112_x_112_2:548527685932941362> <:Fight_Club__Soap__112_x_112_2:548527685932941362>;;
Lol exactly! We will have way more than 15 subs so it‚Äôs all good;;
oh shit <@409836692158021632> you have to keep unlocking it?;;
i thought once you got it, they were unlcoked;;
for good;;
that's bs;;
<@488734758847905803> I'll  have to double check but my understanding is that it acts as an incentive to maintain 15 subs per month;;
wow that's INSANE;;
and super unfair;;
but whatevs;;
what can you do;;
I am so dyslexic omg;;
I read shit in the shade, instead of Chat;;
That's what this channel supposed to be called  <@498246547838992414>;;
Good morning all!;;

Yes that was the good thing if not.... those hours were dragging all the time for sure <@488734758847905803>;;

Feelzpaim;;
Pain*;;
On the side <@488734758847905803>  just a couple of days a week. It was a regular office work.;;
Ouch that is not good <@329001373670572044>;;
Ah damn;;
I hate office woek;;
Work;;
I only ever worked in an office twice;;
For about 9 months total between the two;;
Cause I just can't stand it;;
Wearing dress pants and a suit to work;;
There are just a few privilege enough to live of their art you know;;
In this brazilian weather;;
Yeah definitely;;
I remember trying to be a musician hahaha;;
Hard af;;
It was a nice company and not to tight up;;
When I buy a new bass I'll do a music stream;;
Cool you have to team up with <@278571432588345345>;;

He definitely is;;
I mean good, wasn‚Äôt meaning better than you hahahaha;;
Hmm yes;;
Mango coffee;;
Hahahaha;;
That would have been a wicked burn;;
I am trying to cut back on the coffee, unfortunately cause I love it  <@416803598173995018>;;
True that;;
I haven't had coffee in like.... 4 years;;
Not even a sip;;
Wow;;
Gastritis;;
Makes it hurty hurt;;
Yes that is beginning to be my problem as well;;
Oh damn;;
Don't let it get to where I did;;
I still have to avoid sugar like the plague;;
Is the age hahahaha;;
Hahaha true;;
My mother in law had the surgery done;;
So she doesn't have gastritis anymore;;
But she can never ever vomit;;
Used to have a rock solid stomach could eat anything but now...;;
Same;;
I used to have 1-day-old burgers for breakfast;;
<@557380058566623233> I couldn't live without it lol. <@488734758847905803> not sure how Id like mango coffee lol;;
Lol;;
Oh, I'm sure you'd dig that big seed in your coffee <@416803598173995018>;;
üëÄ;;
üò¶;;
<@488734758847905803>  I don‚Äôt recall, are they real mangos in Brazil;;
?;;
Yes there are <@557380058566623233>;;
We have lots of them;;
Ok;;
Palmer, espada vermelha, tommy;;
Manga rosa;;
Cool we do here too;;
There are a few others;;
But I can't recall;;
purple;;
you forgot purple;;
literally forgot your own name;;
Lol;;
He doesn't count himself as real person;;
I'm not a real person;;
I'm just a bot programmed by orange;;
Too many years spent in dungeon;;
That's why he talks more than I do;;
Lol;;
Like Reek <@488734758847905803>;;
Yeah, if mee6 would count bots, orangebot would had biggest dongle;;
Reeeeek;;
It will be high indeed!;;
lol I mean Orange did take away your dongle too...so it's kinda fitting;;
Fitting dongle;;
<:purple114Top:556843878355959827>;;

And I just napped for 3 hours;;
Oh nice <@!498246547838992414>;;
Love me a good nap;;
Its vactation;;
Thats epic;;
Why do i still have the sub role;;
Niiice <@498246547838992414> !;;
Because you're still subbed I guess;;
Discord does it automatically;;
Because my sub to you ended;;
Yesterday;;
*gasp*;;
I subbed to crim;;
Im sorry mango;;

Thank ya, mango just joined mine so I wanted to do the same, and see all your bright and shining faces üòÇ as my mom the teacher would say.;;
Mango you slut, stop joining other communities  <@488734758847905803>;;
Welcome <@446024265549086720>;;
Haha he tried to slip me the mango.;;
Hahaha nice <@446024265549086720>;;
I can't help it <@207416847019016202>;;
I love meeting new people;;
Haha;;
Tahts how I am on twitter. Non freaking stop.;;
I'm curious to see <@207416847019016202> 's answer to the first <#563739289351880726> question;;
True that <@446024265549086720> ;;
I'm still getting used to Twitter;;
I had never used it before streaming;;
Me too, I dont know like all the metrics and strategy but I know enough to be dangerous üí•;;
Hahaha;;
Welcome to the danger zone;;
Well as you may have guessed, I chickened out on the gym, gonna get some breakfast and find something to console me that might also be physically demanding.;;
Good job <@!446024265549086720>, your dongle just grew to 1!;;
Yeah, don't beat yourself too bad about that. I chickened out a lot when I first started too. It's totally ok to respect your limits, be they physical or emotional or psychological;;
Hm yea ok;;
The fact that I left the house before 9am is impressive though.;;
Wow, that is definitely a win haha;;
I haven't done that in forever;;
I just don't leave the house entirely, so good job <@446024265549086720>;;
Haha amazon ftw;;
Hell yeah!!;;
Also to mention, walmart had a feature where you can buy groceries online and pick everything up curbside. So worth.;;
Oohh;;
I want that in my country;;
<@446024265549086720> Brazil has at-home delivery for most big super markets;;
You go to their site and buy everything;;
And they deliver it and take it up to your apartment even;;
You don't have to.leabe the damned apartment;;
Nice, can they inject the nutrients in my bloodstream, cause I just can't be botheres streaming apex for 64hrs straight. Kthx. <:Kappa:444384351782699009>;;
Hahaha lol <@446024265549086720>;;
Lmao <@446024265549086720>;;
America has that too. Cause we are fat and lazy lol;;
America has everything;;
Consumerism bs;;
Can't even let Brazil have one thing;;
ONE THING;;
Except football;;
Except for universal healthcare!;;
We have football, our teams just suck at it lol;;
Well, our universal healthcare is shit, but at least it's free shit;;
America has the best thing ever, electrolytes.;;
Lol;;
Yea mango knows about the brawndo crave.;;
I actually don't;;
I just thought what you said was funny hahha;;
What's the brawndo cave?;;
We have free shit healthcare too.;;
But also at least it's free;;
Yeah at least it‚Äôs free lol. I pay almost $5000 a year for mine;;
USD;;
Omg that's crazy;;
Its from a movie called Idiocracy, classic.;;
Good morning everyone. Hope you all have a great day;;
<@488734758847905803> lol yeah and it still sucks and you always have to pay more;;
speaking of health insurance, I might have just broken my toe!;;
Welcome <@446024265549086720> ! ;;
Nothing but love and electrolytes for my president Terry Crews! üòÇ;;
Happy Friday, everyone!;;
Yo <@311684705810513921> !;;
Damn <@416803598173995018> ;;
Damn <@416803598173995018> again hahaha fuck;;
Yo <@409836692158021632> !;;
Yep! Just dropped a really heavy box on it, heard it snap and its already bruised. Good times! Funny thing is, my fiance stubbed her toe really badly yesterday on the bed and Im pretty sure she broke it too lol. Guess we are both going to urgent care today with the same problem;;
Hahahah;;
my neck and shoulder is fucked and now my toe. Its all down hill once you turn 30;;
If the doctors don't make one joke about that, they aren't real doctors and you should run;;
Shit;;
Glad I'm only 12;;
12? Your dongle berries havent even dropped yet;;
Hm. If you broke your For, should you pay for medical care?;;
A lot, I mean?;;
Because here medical trauma centers is free, and I don't think that it need to be very good;;
Shit will do;;
I mean physical traumas of course;;
No doctor will help your mental problems caused by Taylor swift never going to russia;;
Hahaha;;
damn <@416803598173995018> ;;
sorry about that toe, man!;;
<@409836692158021632> , check out <#563739289351880726>;;
Hahahahaha ;;
I've got a therapist for that Taylor Swift problem <@207416847019016202>;;
Markla, would you rather have your wife respect you or your daughter respect you?  <@409836692158021632>;;
Win win, considering current state;;
<@488734758847905803> I just finished reading through the would-you-rather stuff and I'm all <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
hahahaha <@207416847019016202> ;;
those options would never be available in my life or in any alternate universe unfortunately;;
Lmao <@207416847019016202> hahahaa;;
<@207416847019016202> if I go to emergency room, I pay minimum $300 with my insurance. There is a lot of stuff after that is not covered too;;
Lol <@409836692158021632>;;
<@409836692158021632> thanks man lol.;;
Damn <@416803598173995018> that is ridiculous;;
"No wonder Americans are always like ""don't get hurt, kids""";;
It's cause they can't afford it;;
What you mean pay with your insurance?  <@416803598173995018>;;
I don't really know details;;
who needs a toe anyway, right <@416803598173995018> ?;;
<@488734758847905803> when I had my knee surgery 2 years ago, I had to pay $300 for the MRI and then $1000 for the deductible after;;
<@207416847019016202> even though I have insurance, I still have to pay. The system is broken here;;
We have a saying in Brazil for moments like that <@416803598173995018>;;
laugh so you don't cry;;
Hm. Here we have a lot of paid expensive options.  But all that trauma shit easily included in free insurance. Of course, sometimes you need to buy medicine and stuff, but it's relatively cheap;;
<@488734758847905803> lol yeah pretty much that's how it goes. What else can you do?;;
Exactly;;
You can ask for support from your discord friends;;
And then watch them mock your country's healthcare;;
"I was sick whole November and me and me a Orange spent a lot on meds, but that ""a lot "" was less than $100 I think";;
hahaha your country doesn't love you;;
Yeah <@207416847019016202> medicine here isn't too bad either;;
And mrs Orange I meant. Fuck autocorrect;;
<@207416847019016202> yeah health insurance here is a joke. It only benefits the companies who get rich off it and it fucks everyone else. Especially the poor and elderly population. A lot of people go to Canada or Mexico to have operations done or get medication because its so much cheaper there;;
Canada is so awesome;;
Some people on where I from go to China to make teeth;;
My parents did it before moving to moscow;;
Because here it's relatively expensive;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah I wish I could live there but the weather sucks also so;;
Not only teeth. Some people I know went to Asia to do operations, because it was still a lot less expensive;;
Some serious stuff I mean;;
Hm;;
yeah same here. I know so many people that go to mexico for operations cause its better and a lot cheaper;;
Interesting to know;;
Better in mejico?;;
Yeah <@409836692158021632> if I was on my pc id have a testosterone fueled gif for you furr sure.;;
<@488734758847905803> Si;;
hahaha <@446024265549086720>;;
M√©xico;;
Lmao;;
Mejor em mejico;;
En*;;
https://youtu.be/X-EJ29G2K7U;;
La operaci√≥n √©s mejor;;
Perfect example of US health screwing people;;
What's best with free medicine- you don't pay doctor to see you. In paid clinics just visit to doctor can be 30-40 bucks, and of course you can't just visit once;;
Trump: buildma;;
Que √©s buildma, sr Trump?;;
Trump: buildma walls;;
lmao;;
Ugh hes coming to CA today I think;;
Ew;;
Good morning @the <@311684705810513921>;;
What's CA;;
"to look at the ""crisis"" at the border";;
Good morning <@409836692158021632>;;
CA is abbreviation for California <@207416847019016202>;;
lazy americans dont want to spell the whole thing;;
oh i hate your American state abbreviations;;
<@557380058566623233> morning;;
Morning  <@557380058566623233>;;
lmao <@207416847019016202> I will do nothing but abbreviate the states now for you;;
I grew up in MA;;
spent a lot of time in NH, ME, CT and RI;;
sometimes NY;;
Good morning again <@207416847019016202>;;
I grew up in fuck you American;;
And I'm from NJ;;
hahahahahahahahaha;;
ahhh NJ, the garden state;;
Well, we all know that means Russia <@207416847019016202>;;
NJ;;
Like jersey shore;;
Exactly  <@488734758847905803>;;
Lol <@417075583692963840>;;
I'm from northern NJ;;
Where there's a lot of nature and cool stuff;;
Not south Jersey where there's...;;
yeah nothing like the coastal NJ lol;;
Well, nothing;;
Or coastal NJ;;
Ew;;
So gross;;
Like oklahoma Ew;;
Like, I can't even, like, deal, with this, like, grossness;;
Wait... is there a city called new jersey?;;
*clicks tongue*;;
It's a state <@207416847019016202>;;
But is there a city?;;
you dont like needles and prostitutes everywhere? <@488734758847905803>;;
Are you from Oklahoma <@417075583692963840> ?;;
Um no;;
Not that I know of <@207416847019016202>;;
Lol <@416803598173995018>;;
good morning <@557380058566623233> üòÅ;;
jersey city <@207416847019016202>;;
I mean, Sparta was close to the first port where heroin comes into the country;;
There was some shitty new yourk suburbs that always got mentioned in how I met your mother;;
Oklahoma is trash;;
I thought it called new jersey;;
So people in my town used to get the best street heroin in the country;;
<@207416847019016202> the state is but theres no city called new jersey, its called jersey city;;
Yes there ia a city is called Jersey City <@207416847019016202>;;
Is jersey city 40 mins near new York?  <@416803598173995018>;;
Lol <@416803598173995018>;;
Just about <@207416847019016202>;;
That;;
Maybe a little more;;
Iirc;;
Hm okay, probably they just said jersey;;
<@207416847019016202> its about 20 minutes away from NYC;;
And I thought it was new jersey;;
Good reason to rematch how I met your mother;;
Rewatch;;
New York and New Jersey are right next to each other;;
Yeah;;
NJ is ny's butt;;
You mean state near to new York?;;
yeah they border each other;;
and new york city is just across the bridge from jersey city;;
<@488734758847905803> lol for real. Jersey is the asshole of the north east;;
That is what Americans say <@488734758847905803>;;
Is jersey city in new jersey state?;;
yes <@207416847019016202>;;
Oh ok now it makes sense;;
yeah it can be confusing. It would be like you trying to explain where cities are in Russia, I would have no clue lol;;
It just get mentioned a lot, like small shitty city near new York, and I thought it was city name;;
lol yeah its very shitty. I have been once, will never go back;;
"Well i did get idea that jersey city is shitty in a way that ""it's not a big crazy city"", which a lot of people actually like";;
I don't, but a lot do like, so I thought people like jersey city;;
I havent been in a long time so I cant say what its like now. When I went about 14 years ago, it was not nice at all. Very dirty and lots of crime;;
haha i know what you mean;;
Jersey city sucks;;
Look at pictures of pequannock <@416803598173995018>;;

Morning <@278571432588345345>;;

Cheers <:jamminjonny:536237981325852672>;;
Cool. Just followed him on Twitch;;
Coolio;;
What are you guys up to today?;;
Getting hyped about mk11 <@488734758847905803>;;
IT'S NEARLY HEREEEEE;;
Nice;;
I pre-ordered it because I want shao kahn;;
I don't like fighting games so I am not part of said hype;;
Lol nice;;
It don't you wish games would just give you all the characters when you buy the base game like before?;;
Yeah, that would be nice;;
But I don't mind paying extra;;
curious, who looks are someones tweet history before following back, or do you just readf the bio and thas it?;;
I kinda just read the bio tbh <@446024265549086720>;;
im getting an intresting mix of answers honestly,  alot of people do both.;;
because the more people I follow back that don't give good content I just end up unfollowing later.;;
I see <@446024265549086720>;;
I'm not that picky on Twitter cause I don't spend too much time on it;;
But that might be because I followed so many people back that don't have good contenr that I haven't gotten hooked to it;;
I'll have to look into that;;
600 kills total on apex now and 400 with wraith. I feel like that‚Äôs good and then I see people with 20,000 lol and it‚Äôs not so good;;
Also, hey everyone!;;
Lol;;
You're probably one of the best here still;;
What up changeova;;
did you play spec ops the line? <@416803598173995018>;;
<@488734758847905803> lol I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm bad, I know I‚Äôm good at apex haha. To be fair those people play wayyyy more than I do that have all those kills. I had some crazy ones on my stream yesterday. <@207416847019016202> nope, haven‚Äôt played that before;;

I just saw it and can confirm^^^;;
then I probably would not want to see that as I like my brain where it is.;;
Oof <@446024265549086720> it is the worst thing I have ever done;;
Just ignore it's existence;;
will take your word for it <:cohh7:480789435227701268>;;

Woah congrats on the 400 mangoes <:PM:539114910211112995>  <@488734758847905803> !;;
The <#540870190846574602> thing, I keep reading Artistic as something completely different;;
Autistic?;;
Yeah mango is a big boi now;;
lol;;
Yes <@455797717763883009>;;
Yo  <@416803598173995018>;;
Lol you should check yourself out  <@498246547838992414>;;
Finally started Detroit Become Human, damn it's SO GOOD;;
I need to wear my glasses more often;;
401 to be precise <@488734758847905803>  cool!;;
That is on my backlog <@455797717763883009>;;
But I am on the fence with this one;;
I played only a bit, definitely my kinda game;;
Plus i got it for 20 bucks. So, worth it;;
Also  bought RE:2 finally;;
Need to finish these two before Days Gone drops end of this month;;
Oh that one definitely on the list. I played the first one when it came out, still have good memories of it;;
You wear glasses? <@498246547838992414> nerdddddd, jk I wear glasses too lol but I usually wear my contacts;;
I am waiting for  *mortal kombat 11* <@455797717763883009>;;
<@455797717763883009> detroit looked intriguing;;
I meant the original re2;;
<@416803598173995018> I won't wear contacts, they sp00k me;;
And I think glasses are KooL;;
Not a big fan of fighting games <@498246547838992414>;;
dont like sticking stuff in your eyes? <@498246547838992414>;;
Why? <@498246547838992414>  contacts are the best thing ever;;
<@557380058566623233> yes, I hate my glasses lol. I cant wait to get laser eye surgery;;
Nooo. Glasses are more fashionable;;
Okay, 3 @'s at once, let's do this...;;
<@455797717763883009> agreed but they throw my depth perception off and its not comfortable to wear a headset with them either;;
yeah the headset thing is a bit annoying;;
I love fighting games because I like abusing people and seeing them in pain <@455797717763883009>, I don't like anything In my eyes <@416803598173995018> because it freaks me out having something on my eyeballz. I just prefer myself with glasses now <@557380058566623233>, I'm used to them now;;
lol;;
Uwu;;
<@498246547838992414> I am an absolute dumpster fire at fighting games lol;;
Im so bad, its painful to watch lol;;
also I can understand not wanting to put stuff in your eyes;;
I'm not half bad actually, Mainly because I despise every other fighing game except MK <@416803598173995018>;;
I loved MK and street fighter growing up, I was just trash at them and still am lol;;
I played a LOT of mortal kombat, I played MK 1, 2, 3, Armageddon, 9, X, and the mobile game;;
#ermacgang;;
Played a bit of MK during High school. Not so much afterwards;;
I'm not the best either <@416803598173995018>, but the thing I enjoy is doing the combos and looking cool;;
My eyesight is really bad my ophthalmologist says is not worth the surgery. I wear contacts since I was 13 <@416803598173995018>;;
And pretend your victim is your teacher? <@455797717763883009>, If so, I can relate...;;
Do not like fighting games <@498246547838992414>;;
yeah that is fun <@498246547838992414>;;
same <@557380058566623233> my eyes get worse every 2 years or so;;
Im hoping they stop getting worse so I can have it done;;
Mine too that is the worst;;
haha you can say that crim;;
Im at -4.00 for my right eye and -3.75 for my left for my contact prescription;;
so Im fooking blind lol;;
been wearing glasses for the past 18 years;;
Mine are getting worse too, but I can function normally without my glasses, I just need them in school, and for seeing far away;;
<@416803598173995018>  -7.5 on my left -5.25 on the right;;
<@455797717763883009> been about the same for me. Weird thing is, no one else is my family needed glasses for seeing distance lol so I have no clue where I got this from;;
<@557380058566623233> oh wow;;
I thought mine was bad, damn!;;
Mine are -1.25 left and -1.00 right, and it's just getting worse;;
Yeah;;
So not too bad;;
Noice;;
*noice*;;
Not bad <@498246547838992414>  just use them so it doesn‚Äôt grow too fast;;
<@498246547838992414> thats not too bad;;
Yeah, I use them a lot in school, at home I just forget, I need to work on that;;
yeah what <@557380058566623233> said;;
it is super easy to forget. For me I looked so stupid with my first pair so I was crazy self conscious about them and hardly wore them ever;;
I look weird without them imo;;
So, opposite for me <@416803598173995018>;;
Epic;;
Wow it feels as if I'm in the hospital. Everyone with bad vision;;

i like that game;;
no problem, comrade!;;
Hey guys, actually feeling a little sick and am going to the er;;
Nothing serious;;
dude...feel better <@488734758847905803>;;
The universe conspires against me once again;;
Damn <@488734758847905803> hope you‚Äôre ok;;
What is we?;;
Er;;
Emergency?;;
<@!498246547838992414> Idk üòÇ;;
<@207416847019016202> emergency room;;
Hm;;
Why go there?;;
Don't you have option to call it?;;
So they would come over?;;
Like an ambulance come to get you?;;
not neceserily get you;;
here ambulance can come to you and if you not bad enough, just give you a shot of something, for examle of you have fever;;
if you having like 39 or 40 degrees fever, and meds dont help, you call ambulance and they give you shot (or i dont know whats the right term for it), and its okay, you can continue your treatmeant, go to doctor and stuff...;;
ahhh ok, yeah not sure how it works in Brasil;;
can you do it in US?;;
Doesnt usually work that way here. You only get ambulance if you are really bad;;
hm 40 fever is really bad;;
and its expensive usually cause insurance only covers a piece of it;;
but no point going to hospital;;
fuck;;
I hope Purple wasn't playing with Gerbils again...;;
so if i have nearly lethal fever, novody can fix me free and fast??;;
You could call ambulance or go to emergency room;;
lol <@409836692158021632>;;
well you say its not free <@416803598173995018>;;
here it will be free even if you dont have an insurance;;
they are fucking ambulance, they have to go and help you;;
No, nothing is free with hospitals here in US lol;;
Emergency room trip for me is minimum $200 USD. Ambulance is probably around $500-$600;;
so it costs you money to not die lol;;
dude what are you saying right now is basically killing me;;
i will call an ambulance right now;;
and it will be fucking free;;
we call a ambulance at least once a year when we got sick bad;;
what if you really really dont have money? <@416803598173995018> ;;
maybe there are at least some free options???;;
I believe there is free clinics but they usually are not good;;
ambulance is almost never free;;
they send you the bill after;;
oh okay;;
here ambulance is part of free govermental system;;
free clinics and free ambulance;;
they are bad of course;;
but fuck you dont need much from ambulance;;
when i got 40 fever, all i need is just med shot to not die, and bad free healthcare system is okay for that;;
lol yeah you dont need much from ambulance in certain situations at least. Yeah free healthcare would probably be ok here too, depending on where you are I guess. I've never been so Im not sure honestly;;
never been where?;;
in free ambulance?;;
yeah Ive never taken an ambulance before, never been to free clinic and only been to the emergency room twice. Once I was a kid and dont remember and the other was for a bad cut. I had to pay $200 then I think and that was it;;
yeah thats crazy;;
yeah and they did an awful job lol. I have a really bad scar now because they did such a bad job. The doctor that took them out, who was a different doctor even said they did an awful job stitching it up;;
not that I mind lol. I like scars honestly, think they are cool;;
DONGLE;;
Good job <@!416803598173995018>, your dongle just grew to 29!;;
YES!;;
hahaha;;
Im coming for you <@488734758847905803>;;
haha;;
only 5 levels behind now. If he takes time off or doesnt post alot, I can catch up quick;;
or if brasil healthcare is very shitty;;
lol yes that too;;
then this discord becomes The Orange Tree;;
isnt it already?;;
Yes but not technically in the title, it still says The Mango Tree in the top left;;
yeah im pretty sure its discord bug;;
Lol;;
Someone knows if <@488734758847905803>  is ok? Still in the er?;;
no word yet from Purple;;
I hope everything is ok;;
I hope so too <@557380058566623233>;;
I really hope it's nothing bad or anything;;
he said it wasn't anything serious;;
but I hope he's doing fine and gets through it;;
<@488734758847905803> please let us know if you're ok when you can;;

That‚Äôs one big dongle;;
*Mine* <@510594499202908160>;;
I'm rank 5 woot;;
Hey guys;;
Just an update:;;
Got home from the hospital a while ago;;
Took a nap;;
Am better;;
Still drowsy / sluggish;;
They gave me medication;;
I don't know what was in it, but I passed out very easily;;
Hey, it‚Äôs good to hear you are better dude;;
Thanks <@510594499202908160> !;;
Np. I mean if that‚Äôs not personal to ask , do you have a flu or something?? , hopefully nothing serious or super bad;;
Nah it's not personal;;
I didn't get anything stuck up anywhere...this timd;;
Time*;;
Lok;;
Lol;;
Lol well that‚Äôs a relief;;
Anyway. I was feeling dizzy and stuff and it wouldn't go away no matter what;;
So I started feeling a bit panicky and paranoid;;
For some reason my blood pressure was low, even after eating;;
And that also made me nauseated;;
So I went to the hospital to see how fast I was gonna die;;
Cause that's how paranoid I got at one point;;
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty scary;;
But then they asked me some questions;;
Gave me a shot of something;;
And sent me home;;
And you feel kinda better?;;
Hopefully some rest and meds will patch you up quick;;
Yeah. I'm not dizzy anymore at least;;
Well that‚Äôs good being dizzy is the worst;;
Yeah. Feeling dizzy is really bad;;
Can't get your head on straight or think at all;;
I hate it;;
Glad you're back and ok;;
But yeah, now I'm just drowsy and like;;
Drowsy;;
And slow;;
If someone wanted to beat me up, they could send their 6 year old daughter to do it;;
Maybe a 5 year old;;
Are you pregnant  again, <@488734758847905803> üòÇ  ;;
Jk...glad and relieved you're back home and ok;;
Hhahah;;
Yeah me too. Thanks guys!;;
Tomorrow I'm gonna try to do a stream at around 9pm my timr;;
Time*;;
So like... 6pm California time I think?;;
You guys are 3 hours behind me iirc;;
Sounds good!;;
No, you're 4 behind;;
So 5pm your time;;
Anyway, yeah I'm gonna try to do that;;
Cause I was dying to stream today;;
Dying;;
Absolutely dying;;
So much so that I almost died of dizziness;;
Lolz;;
Haha;;
He actually had emergency dongle removal surgery.;;
I am so glad to hear you are ok <@488734758847905803>;;

Hey @@everyone ;;
Just a quick announcement in case this interests anyone out there. ;;
This is a video that me and Purple created together to help people that want to know more about Spiritism, which is our religion. ;;
There is a bunch of links to free books in the description in a lot of different languages.;;
https://youtu.be/RglJkaeKUvQ;;
;;
I suggest the first one that is a series of questions and answers about pretty much everything.;;
;;
In case anyone is interested, check it out.;;
;;
Spiritism is a Christian based religion with the concept of reincarnation.;;
Good morning all!;;

To make up for yesterday's lack of a stream;;
Hecc yes;;
<:purple114Master:556843879593148426>;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Don't lose that will to live;;
I need it for... Stuff;;

Oh oh sounds ominous;;
Mango is gonna do something;;
And I probably won't like it;;
Yep;;
Habaha;;
Yeah;;
Feel the fear;;
It helps with the stuff;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> orange is fear;;

What up <@416803598173995018>;;

Not much. ;;
Just making me some eggs then going to the grocery store before the foking stream;;
Or maybe I won't even go to the grocery store;;
What have vegetables ever done for me?;;

Hahh;;
Not tasting good;;
Having hormones;;
Nice try;;
Eh some vegetables do. I mostly eat asparagus, green beans and broccoli. Sometimes carrots;;
But! I cover them in cheese lol. Not the green beans or carrots;;
You disgusting blasphemer!;;
Well, I never!;;
Oh I‚Äôm sorry for eating healthy and wanting to live a long time!;;

Hey! <@557380058566623233> how you doing today?;;
Little headache but today is a slow day so that‚Äôs good;;

But I feel like streaming and being social again üòÉ;;
That‚Äôs cool <@87241615671832576>  I have been trying to catch the stream of everyone here, I haven‚Äôt catch yours yet;;

Also, something weird happened last night, I was trying to Listen to Behemoth, I don't really like them;;
When i went to bed this one part of a song got stuck in my head;;
So I was for the entire night like:  *come on to me bartzabel*;;
So I think I am now possessed;;
Sounds like a healthy thing. A possessed Waffle üòÉ;;
The first borderlands <@87241615671832576> ? Or the pre-sequel?;;
Haha;;
The first one, the original üòÑ;;
It's the only one I have;;
But I was interested in seeing how well it have aged;;
TRUE;;
And how did it fair in your view?;;
I never played it;;
Graphically it was good, besides it started out on 640x800 and without anything to add to graphics;;
But after cranking it up, it looks good;;
there's some funny jank when you need to switch weapons and have to compared weapons and for some reason it feels like hitboxes are weird at times;;
Nice;;
But I've hit level 14 or 15;;
So I ams till in the beginning;;
I never played borderlands before. Is it kinda like fallout style gameplay?;;
Happy Tuesday, everyone!;;
<@416803598173995018> I only played the first mission in bl 2;;
So I don't know;;
Hey <@409836692158021632> !;;
hey <@416803598173995018> ;;
how are you liking the warmer LA weather???;;
ahh ok <@488734758847905803>;;
its meh <@409836692158021632> too soon for it to be this hot I think;;
Hey  <@409836692158021632>;;
hey <@488734758847905803> ;;
really excited for the Sekiro stream today!!!;;
It's warm even here. 14 lol;;
Same <@409836692158021632> !;;
dobroye comrade <@207416847019016202>;;
Huh. Weird. It's cold here;;
Rainy too;;
it was 88 yesterday, not ok;;
Fuck farenheit;;
I agree lol but I dont know celsius;;
I thought  <@416803598173995018> is true european;;
I was wrong;;
31;;
Hello guys <@409836692158021632> <@207416847019016202>;;
As descendant from family of european sluts you should know Celsius  <@416803598173995018>;;
Hey  <@557380058566623233>;;
lmao;;
Here is always friking hot even in winter;;
yesterday, I saw a streamer friend rage quit Sekiro.;;
which was kinda surprising since he blazed through all the bosses in the beginning;;
and he's clearly very skilled at the game;;
then, I watched another streamer who wasn't so skilled;;
but she beat the same boss that my friend rage quit on;;
so I found that comparison very very amusing;;
hello <@557380058566623233>;;
My personal feelings is rage quitting for a streamer can be real or it can be a plot to engage the audience.;;
Good job <@!446024265549086720>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
I am dreading this game <@409836692158021632>  I already started it though;;
this one was real <@446024265549086720> üòÇ;;
either way it's entertaining, but I have seen streamers more or less kill themselves so they can get mad.;;
31 is pretty much maximum hotness here in summer  <@416803598173995018>;;
Maybe 35;;
you'll be fine <@557380058566623233> ;;
if it gets too much just stop for a bit or play something else;;
Celsius? <@207416847019016202>;;
hottest Ive ever seen it get here was 47;;
<@207416847019016202>;;
Yes definitely that IS the strategy lol <@409836692158021632>;;
47? You're kidding me. It's kinda Dubai summer temperature. I didn't know la has that  <@416803598173995018>;;
Yes Celsius   <@557380058566623233>;;
lol yeah last year it lasted for a few weeks like that if I remember correctly;;
Puff that is winter time here <@207416847019016202>;;
Yeah it sucks to live in hot countries;;
Agree;;
what time will you go live <@488734758847905803> ?;;
In about an hour <@409836692158021632>;;
Hell yeah!!!;;
Cool;;
awwwww yeah! I'll be there to cheer you on, my dude!;;
You meant cheer on him?  <@409836692158021632>;;
TODAY I WILL RAID YOU,  YOU FOK;;
Niiiice;;
I might even stream with my glasses;;
CAuse I'm a neeeeeerd;;
Same;;
Lol;;
hey, glasses are sexy dude;;
but I understand that it can be difficult with the headphones;;
haha <@207416847019016202> cheer or jeer? ;;
that game needs a lot of emotional support from chat;;
Glasses, Clue, problem solved üòâ;;
I have no issues with Glasses & headphones, only that sometimes my glasses point up when i don't wanth them to;;
What's an emotional support?;;
Lol;;
What are emotions?;;
but that's because you're a handsome af waffle boi <@498246547838992414> ;;
looking good with or without glasses ü§ì;;

Yeah seriously lol. <@455797717763883009> is on top of stuff!;;
Haha whenever I see game news, you're the first ones I share with üòÑ;;
I'm usually browsing through news during work;;
morning <@416803598173995018>;;
Thanks man! <@455797717763883009> what‚Äôs going on? <@207416847019016202>;;
Mid week load at work. Also the Milan Design Week just began. So the whole city is like an amusement park lol;;
Need to go visit all the installations etc;;
<@488734758847905803> what did you think of Sekiro so far?;;
It's  my man  <@278571432588345345>;;
<:letsgo112:536845541041242122>;;
yooo;;
Oooh yeaah;;
That sounds pretty cool <@455797717763883009>;;
Need to come by stream sometime!;;
Hey <@278571432588345345> how are you?;;
Need a fucking break;;
honestly, doing great;;
getting shit done at work and then playing games;;
<@278571432588345345> is always doing great. ever since he moved to his new place;;
yeah very happy overall;;
Good to hear buddy!;;
some bad stuff here and there just like anyone but pretty good overall;;
Yeah ups and downs are inevitable;;
That‚Äôs awesome! <@278571432588345345>;;
<@278571432588345345> I love it;;
Japanese lore is freaking awesome;;
Morning <@416803598173995018>;;
We're honored to be the first <@455797717763883009>;;
The game is a bit hard, but as I've never played dark souls, and the first souls-type game I played was nioh, I feel like this game is very satisfying;;
awesome;;
I was a little afraid you would find it too frustrating;;
it can be a bit daunting;;
Damn. Need to get my hands on Sekiro;;
that japanese asmr dialogue tho;;
so slow hahaha;;
super slow and quiet;;
Yeaaaah;;
I love it;;
I might get frustrated, but I'm not one to quit over a little frustration;;
I need to watch mango stream sekiro lol. Mad I wasn‚Äôt able to really yesterday;;
Hahaha;;
It's a really cool game <@416803598173995018>;;
<@278571432588345345> , do you play sekiro off stream to practice at all?;;
nope;;
I like people seeing the progression in skill happen;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah Ive enjoyed watching people stream it;;
from nub to stud;;
Same as what I thought <@278571432588345345>;;
Damn. We must be brothers;;
Coffee time! ‚òï cant do anything at work without it lol;;
<a:hotcoffee:537944974160035861>;;
lets go;;
Love that emote haha;;
lol that is an awesome emote;;
I feel better now that I have taken my first sip of coffee lol;;
Good morning everyone!!;;
Morning! <@557380058566623233>;;
I am loving the slow dialogue in Sekiro because that way I can almost follow everything on Japanese without reading the subtitles <@278571432588345345>  <@488734758847905803>;;
<@416803598173995018>  morning;;
Good afternoon everbody;;
Hello <@329001373670572044>;;
Hallo <@557380058566623233>;;
Do not ask for pictures <@207416847019016202>  <@498246547838992414>  needs to be himself that day lol;;
Hey <@329001373670572044>;;
hows your day going? <@557380058566623233>;;
Just started <@416803598173995018>  lol ask me in a couple of hours, but is shaping to be quiet;;
True that <@557380058566623233> !;;
I didn't know you spoke Japanese so we'll!;;
<@557380058566623233> showoff!;;
Well*;;
hahaha;;
Damn phone;;
<@455797717763883009> Brazilian accounts can't change their names yet;;
Foooook;;
Hahahaha if they speak slowly I am good if not I can‚Äôt follow;;
Yep <@278571432588345345>;;
I would love to change my ps4 name it was one of those random ones;;
Morning <@557380058566623233>;;
i need those picture to approve, i dont want my favourite <@498246547838992414>  to date ugly chicks;;
Hahahaha good point <@207416847019016202>;;
<@557380058566623233> ahh ok, well hopefully its a good day!;;
Thanks! <@416803598173995018> yours may be starting as well no?;;
It is! Had my coffee just now and Im in a good mood, its just starting  as well so hopefully it continues to go well. I have a doctors appointment later too so they can hopefully figure out what is going on with my neck/shoulder area. Keep having bad pain and strained muscles for no apparent reason;;
Stress;;
They probably will send you to a physiotherapist;;
I believe it is more than that. Been reoccurring for almost 5 years and I have bad popping noises as well. I saw a chiropractor last week and he thinks its the joint. I have had cortisone shots in both shoulders and physical therapy after both and it didnt help. I just hope its nothing serious;;
Go to a specialist in neck and shoulder not all orthopedic doctors treat every area;;
Yeah he is a shoulder specialist;;
I saw the wrong doctor last time, he was a neck specialist but the chiropractor said its in my shoulder, not neck;;
Ok good;;
I bet shoulder specialist will say that problem is in neck;;
Lol <@207416847019016202>;;
Lol <@207416847019016202>  I wish I have your quickness for humor;;
I wish I had it too;;
But to be honest it is a real problem with doctors - they are always point one to another;;
TRUE;;
it's not humor <@557380058566623233> , it's pessimism;;
lol hopefully that doesn‚Äôt happen and he can help me. It‚Äôs tough living with this constant pain;;
Lmao;;
I have a better would you rather then <@416803598173995018>;;
would you rather be in constant shoulder and neck pain;;
Or in mango tree server;;
or be lactose intolerant and have gastritis forever;;
lmao;;
Yeah that‚Äôs a b...;;
NO <@207416847019016202> !;;
YOU RUINED MY WOULD YOU RATHER;;
I'LL GET YOU FOR THAT;;
I improved it  <@488734758847905803>;;
Lol;;
oof, I return and mango is shouting at orange lol;;
I think you can control the lactose thing easier than the pain;;
Flawless timing;;
lol <@498246547838992414>;;
did the date happen alreaady?;;
I literally just got home;;
It went well;;
Oh that is nice <@498246547838992414>;;
yeah, it is;;
awesome!;;
<@488734758847905803> that‚Äôs a shitty would you rather. There is no winning, only losing;;
well, that's the point of a would you rather;;
i want both options to suck;;
so you can imagine the pain;;
and then be glad you dont have to;;
But I do have pain lol;;
lol;;
that's true;;
so only you lose for real;;
we get to win and bask in the glory of not having those things;;
except I am lactose intolerant and i do have gastritis;;
so everyone can laugh at us;;
I'd rather have the pain because I would die without milk;;
I see;;
werid;;
weird*;;
man so you cant eat cheese? <@488734758847905803>;;
disaster dood;;
I can actually;;
just not requeijao or catupiry;;
like creamy cheeses;;
my lactose intolerance isnt super high;;
its something I guess;;
condensed milk is a no-o;;
no0no*;;
omg;;
no-no;;
there's actually this funny story about when <@467974634977886220> and I were in Paris;;
Ufff condense milk is way too much;;
and I ate some rattatouile;;
and didnt realize it had heavy cream;;
until... you know;;
the pain started;;
and i was on the street;;
walking;;
then mango shat his organs out;;
and there were NO BATHROOMS ANYWHERE;;
I literally thought i was gonna have to shit my pants or shit in the street;;
So <@488734758847905803>  no ice cream!!!;;
like, i was sweating;;
no ice cream <@557380058566623233>;;
I FORGOT;;
üò¶;;
I actually have icecream;;
lets go!;;
lmao;;
CURSES;;
üò©;;
<@278571432588345345> no. bad!;;
get rekt mango;;
lol;;
Paris can suck for finding bathrooms lol;;
True <@416803598173995018>;;
so, get this;;
I went to the eiffel tower;;
and I was like;;
there are guards there;;
they HAVE to have toilets;;
try coming to Norway; we might have bathrooms but they are locked.;
lmao;;
so then I go up to one of them;;
just wee off onto the air;;
and i'm like;;
telling them this sob story;;
of how much pain i'm in;;
and theyre like;;
I need ice cream when I'm crying in the shower, screaming for the voices to go away;;
"casually, ""there are toilets over there""";;
<@488734758847905803> and then... 23 miles of queue.;;
http://gph.is/1ldYWzX <@498246547838992414>;;
Lol;;
yeah there was a line;;
Lmao;;
but then;;
i was sweating;;
and walking around so much;;
that when the first door opened;;
"the guy in front just nodded his head like, ""you need this more than I do""";;
and he was fucking right;;
lol;;
Lol;;
Thank God for Good Samaritans lol;;
could have been worse dude;;
at least you made it;;
<@488734758847905803> and then you woke up.;;
yeah man;;
womango was already saying stuff like;;
If you shit yourself, i'm leaving your ass here;;
nah jk;;
lmao;;
Lol;;
*But the nightmares still feast on your weary mind*;;
but I honestly dont know what that would have done to my sex appeal;;
Wow you got lucky  that it wasn't me who was first in line  <@488734758847905803>;;
Lmao;;
hahahaah;;
you fok <@207416847019016202> !;;
Lmao;;
i was sweating in pain;;
and like pale;;
and dying;;
at a quicker rate than usual;;
I actually don't mind pain;;
I love pain too. But when it's not mine;;
lmao;;
i have a high tolerance for pain, hence my tattoos;;
I love all kinds op pain, my own and others;;
but stomach pain is just too much;;
oh btw <@409836692158021632> , womango and i finished the OA;;
I see you need this really bad;;
<@498246547838992414> I have an open wound in my mouth in my lower lip and the teeth bracers keep cutting into it.;;
My pain tolerance is pretty high as well, don't really know why;;
would be a shame if I fell asleep in there;;
I have a high pain tolerance too, except when it came to my rib tattoos. Never again...;;
hahaahah <@278571432588345345>;;
oh man, my rib tattoo was also tough as fuck;;
how big is yours <@416803598173995018> ?;;
i bet mine is bigger;;
Oof, oh noes <@351323158826975232>;;
ouch <@351323158826975232>;;
Nothing of yours can be bigger  <@488734758847905803>;;
my rib tattoo begs to differ <@207416847019016202> e;;
Ribs tattoos are the worst;;
that shit goes from my armpit to beyond my waist;;
Tattoos, nope not for me;;
but whyyyyyyyyy <@498246547838992414> ?;;
You got shit all over your body?  <@488734758847905803>;;
I like them on some people, but I don't want them;;
I love tats I am planning the one on my back;;
tatoes maybe;;
hopefully not shit;;
<@207416847019016202> no, remember mango made it to the toilet.;;
Tats on back sounds hot;;
I have NO tats;;
damn <@278571432588345345>;;
most boring dude ever to dude;;
what are you doing?!;;
Lol <@278571432588345345>  is a taste though;;
<@488734758847905803> left side is waistline up to just under my armpit and several inches wide. Right side is about the size of both my hands put together and right in the middle of my side but more out towards the chest area;;
I like <@278571432588345345> 's thinking;;
No tats;;
In women though tattoos have to be discreet or they look ugly;;
agreed;;
damn..;;
you got both ribs <@416803598173995018> ?;;
i need to step up my game;;
Yessir;;
i disagree <@557380058566623233> ;;
some girls pull off having loads of tattoos;;
i'm actually kinda into that haha;;
<@498246547838992414> if you put needles in your waffle iron and close it on your leg, you can make tatoos.;;
Big one was my first lol. The artist was like, you sure you wanna get it there??;;
hahaah;;
Getting 2 more soon;;
Not on ribs;;
It‚Äôs true but not in my case I think;;
Specially in the neck is a no no;;
... <@351323158826975232> you are a very... peculiar person;;
Maybe if you all are lucky, when I get a cam I‚Äôll show you;;
I have two tats lined up;;
one on my left arm;;
and one on my neck;;
Nice. I‚Äôm doing right shoulder and the other will be above my heart on my chest;;
I have two line up but I want t loose all the way I put on when my father got sick;;
I think I'd do right arm if anything;;
Then tattoos will be a reward;;
but cant think of anything I'd like tatoed;;
what designs <@557380058566623233> ?;;
seems too permanent;;
hm;;
<@498246547838992414> But that story has already been told at most 53 times;;
something that is part of your life is easy to start with <@278571432588345345>;;
I know a guy who has tattoos on both arms, crossing over to eachother accross his chest and back;;
Looks sick;;
like, i tattooed a bass and a guitar pick on my right arm;;
The one on the foot is an anchor hook that looks like it goes through your foot pretty cool;;
cool;;
Everyone missed my text about how I‚Äôm gonna take my shirt off when I get a cam and show you my tattoos lol. I‚Äôm so disappointed in you all;;
what;;
dont people get banned for that?;;
where did you see that?;;
That is why you need to be really sure of what you get <@278571432588345345> because it IS permanent;;
and yeah they can be banned;;
lol;;
yeah..;;
well, there is laser removal;;
which I am gonna get for one of my tattoos actually;;
well fuck that;;
lmao;;
Painful and costly and ugly;;
triple fuck that;;
i got that tattoo when I was 16;;
i wanna do some laser surgery to remove it and then cover it with a new tat;;
PCU;;
painful, costly and ugly;;
We didn‚Äôt <@416803598173995018>  we were actually in awe;;
Lol;;
Lmao;;
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get banned for that. Mango has streamed shirtless before haha;;
They might ban it for being too sexy;;
Lmao;;
I did <@416803598173995018> , but it's against twitch's TOS;;
it IS;;
totally against it;;
i didnt know when i did that;;
I have streamed shirtless as well, but I don't have facecam;;
They can‚Äôt stop me!;;
lmao;;
*dabs*;;
it was 38 degrees though that day;;
they can right..;;
I‚Äôll just create another account and stream shirtless again!;;
Lol;;

Not all of people love to yell at  <@498246547838992414>. I prefer to yell at  <@488734758847905803>;;
They do, <@488734758847905803> without good reason;;
Lmao <@207416847019016202>;;

Pineapples are good;;
Dongle?;;
Its chat levels;;
I know that much, but why dongle growth lmao? <@417075583692963840>;;
I remember them saying because dongle is a sexual word;;
So dongle growth;;
"Yeah, it does sound a bit ""odd"" to put it that way";;
lol;;
Lol;;
some people like it when you put it that way though;;
Okay then <@207416847019016202>;;
So it measures how big your umm...;;
*sausage* is?;;
OwO;;
Hehheh;;
OwO;;
not sausage, but your spiritual strength;;
which measures in cm of course;;
and equal to your dongle size;;
Ah okay;;
Deep lore;;
I am not much for comedies but my favorites are the British ones <@565407921085612047>;;

You'd be as high as me <@416803598173995018>;;

<@498246547838992414> how high are you?;;
<@329001373670572044> I play games I enjoy, don't care about the semantics like being online, multiplayer or whatever;;
i also play games i enjoy but i cant enjoy an online only game;;
yeah everyone is different, I dont enjoy alot of MMO games but lots of people do;;
yea and thats a good thing imagine if everyone liked the same stuff;;
lol yeah exactly. World wouldbe boring;;
Im partial to Open World games myself;;
Good job <@!275429891774742531>, your dongle just grew to 5!;;
I only judge people who play fortnite lol. Other than that, I dont care. Just enjoy the games, thats all that matters;;
^ Fortnite players should be judged üòõ;;
lmao;;
I dont think Ive ever hated a guy before Fortnite came out;;
game not guy*;;
fortnite is boring and should just die out already;;
well Apex confirmed that I am not a BR player;;
Im not usually either but I cant stop playing apex lol;;
Dunno what it is;;
I just love it;;
I understand the need to play, I cant stop playing Div 2;;
i love games that  are hard and requires you to think and die and learn;;
I do as well but to an extent. I cant do dark souls or sekiro. I get too frustrated and then dont enjoy it lol;;
oh i love dark souls/demon souls/bloodborne and i will get sekiro the 26th;;
I do however really enjoy watching people stream those games though;;
Aren‚Äôt they kind of like the same thing though at least by concept?;;
i have neveer raged at dark souls;;
Im with changeover on this one, I will not play those games but I like watching the frustration of other people playing those games;;
I mean fortnight and apex and pubs;;
I'm pretty high <@416803598173995018> Just did a new line;;
tee-hee;;
^ good;;
But no, I have not played apex in ages;;
<@329001373670572044> I got past the first area, killed a guy with a ninja type sword and then played maybe a few more hours of dark souls 3 and just tired of it really quickly. No specific reason, just dont like it but I love to watch people play it. Its really entertaining;;
<@498246547838992414> do a couple more lines and then we will talk;;
I'm probably last lmao;;
It may be sound weird but I don't hate any game;;
Fallout 76 <@207416847019016202>;;
Or, to rephrase that, maybe I hate too much games to pick one;;
Lok;;
Lol;;
Why would I hate f76?  <@498246547838992414>;;
I know it's shit game and genre is not for me, but I don't care.;;
Same <@207416847019016202>;;
I may hate Bethesda for killing cool series;;
But I have no reasons to hate game;;
Interesting point;;
Though there are some games that bother me just by looking at them;;
Minecraft is one;;
The shit bethesda pulled in the in-game store, the lack of life in the world, the quests;;
When I see it, it makes me sick;;
Like, it makes me feel like life is scary;;
I played Minecraft yesterday with friends <@488734758847905803> , it's a long story;;
I hate Fortnite for a very specific reason. When the game first came out it was going to be a co-op/single player tower defense type game and I bought it because I am a tower defense junkie. Well I bought it on PS4 and can not play that type of game with a controller so I thought I am currently building a new PC I will get it when finished. We all know what happened after that, original game gone and free BR craziness;;
I like Minecraft;;
So when I was watching your stream, I got a call and a server invite from a friend who I have not spoken in a year, there I was in the server, being greeted with a call with loads of guys from elementary school, we literally all hopped on minecraft for the meme;;
It was fun;;
Yeah in Russia it called to change boots, when you switch to another thing so fast  <@275429891774742531>;;
I was pissed, I was expecting another Orcs Must Die type of game and was excited;;
Yeah the original concept of Fortnite did seem cool <@275429891774742531> so I agree with your statement;;
So yes Fornite is forever in my shit list;;
Yeah but I would say it's reason to hate br genre, not footnote br;;
Fortnite;;
I dont hate BR, I just cant play BR, I however hate Fortnite. There is a distinction;;
Damn <@275429891774742531>;;
That would annoy me as well;;
Maybe the devs are the ones worthy of hate <@275429891774742531>;;
Could be, its hard to let go of that grudge;;
Yeah I still hate fortnite as probably always will lol;;
Really is the only game Ive ever hated;;
I don't hate specific games mostly because I kinda hate whole genres;;
All kind of online games with looped gameplay without story always were kinda no go for me;;
Like really, all of them;;
And of course I always hated them in a way;;
So fortnite for me is no different;;
yeah that makes sense. I usually dont like them either but I do love apex for some reason;;
I thought Id stop playing by now lol;;
Dude you also play rainbow six;;
yeah that too. Just a fun game;;
And I bet some other online shooters;;
So it's generally genre for you;;
I mean more general genre;;
ahh ok yeah yes thats true for me;;
Without dividing to br or looter or anything else;;
Do you enjoy to watch games like that at all?;;
thing is, i dont enjoy watching any games;;
i really cant concentrate on gameplay;;
i can watch a lot of letsplay on youtube, but only if i like how person speak;;
so i would just listen and do my chores or something;;
and when it come to streamers, i watch only several small people who i enjoy chatting with;;
little exception - i can watch story driven games sometimes, but only if i played them;;
you know, to see different decisions and stuff;;
ahh so thats why you like my streams, for my voice lol;;
yeah, games that you play are total shit for me;;
i enjoy ability to chat;;
lmao except for last of us I think, right?;;
thats why i hate when sometimes <@488734758847905803> reads half of messages, for example skipping the first one, and of course after that not understanding the 2nd;;
thing is you dont stream last of us <@416803598173995018>;;
except for couple times;;
lol he's too busy dying thats why he misses stuff;;
yeah I only did twice;;
I do want to  get back to it though. Im just having so much fun playing apex so I cant bring myself to play last of us again;;
yeah i know that dying important, but since i enjoy chatting, i really got disappointed when my message wasnt understood because person didnt read start of message chain;;
yeah thats why i say that you play shit games, because obviously you dont want to return to last of us;;
I do want to finish it, I just dont want to stop playing apex right now. So I will finish last of us eventually;;
also, speaking about fortnite... mango asked some people on interview what games are overrated, and almost all answered fortnite;;
he didnt ask me that so i well tell it now;;
personally for me there are no such thing as overrated games. only underrated;;
I wonder why people think Fortnite is overrated?;;
because they dont like it;;
which is not good reason to consider something overrated;;
Most EA titles to me are overrated, not because I don't like them, but mostly because they don't really bring anything new to the table.;;
And then suddenly we have a way out and Apex;;
"problem with term ""overrated"" is by saying that something is overrated, you mean that so many people should not have play it so much.";;
but obviously they picked it for some reason, so game deserve it;;
agreed <@87241615671832576> Im so excited for Respawns Star Wars game but also terrified because EA is running the show;;
other thing is that maybe there is better game somewhere, but its underrated, so nobody knows about it;;
"but it doesnt make game everybody loves ""overrated""";;
I dont think Fornite is overrated, I just think its a stupid game and their original idea had me excited and they forgot about it cause BR did so well;;
yeah, and i think all online shooters are stupid;;
but its for me;;
i cant judge them objectively because i have no idea how they should be;;
That's the thing about subjectivity. It's so important to know your own preferences so actually be able to convey a good impression and perspective.;;
Yeah good points;;
yo!;;

<@375416862252597248> !!!!! Bro, WE ARE EVERYWHERE!!;;
yeah boi;;
Heyooo <@488734758847905803>;;
<@488734758847905803> ;;
Got this info from another streamer friend.;;
"When reporting a troll who keeps coming back with fake accounts, use the ""Ban Evasion"" reason. ";;
They said it should get them IP Banned.;;
I see not a lot of point in ip ban to be honest  <@409836692158021632>;;
Com plugin for browser solves problem easily;;
Yeah and using VPN gets around it as well.;;
Just pointing out the available options we have that can make it harder for trolls  to harass Mango üòÅ;;
Sorry it was autocorrect.;;
I said vpn plugin.  <@409836692158021632>;;
Cell operator that I use really improved connection inside metro, which is really fucking cool, now I'm online even between stations;;
My family use other operator, and for them there s still no connection;;
Only paid wifi;;
Ah cool;;
hello everyone, how are we today ?;;
Hey  <@87241615671832576>;;
Day is still starting;;
Paid wifi are the worst. We had it in our trains aswell at one point, and luckily it's free now;;
even though it's crap;;
it is starting, I've been thinking of doing a morning stream;;
It is free here. In metro, trains and buses. But to use it you need to see ads;;
Which is fucking not awesome;;
You need to spend a minute, cliking on ads to close;;
Which is why I used to pay 10 bucks a year for ad disable;;
But then they divided services, and you need to pay for metro Wi-Fi and for train Wi-Fi separately, so I stopped pay for both;;
When I say trains, I mean that moscow has one big railroad circle inside, which now is a part of metro system, but it's not underground;;
Ahh okay;;
Well we don't have adds on it either;;
I guess it's mainly because of the quality is just barebones;;
So i am not complaining;;
Quality here good without ads. But with ads you need to see them after every disconnect, that's why it's not usable;;
But if you use metro everyday and your operator doesn't work as good as mine, it's definitely worth 10 bucks a year;;
Oh, it's 15, but still;;
yeahh true, and I guess it's a fair price;;
I mean I am ready to use 10 buck a month just for using a streaming service;;
You mean music streaming? I pay 4 a month for Google music, but actually I can share it with 5 friends, so I pay 4 bucks for 6 people;;
Stuff like Netflix and such üòÉ;;
so you mean video streaming services? <@87241615671832576>;;
dont use any to be honest;;
I do yes, but my point was more. If I can get a really good Wifi service at a place I use regularly for 10$ it's a pretty fair deal;;
yeah but thing is that nobody really needs wifi;;
you just have some place that are known for bad reception, like metro, so you (and me) think that wifi a good option;;
but really its okay if they just improve reception in metro;;
as my cell operator did;;
what funny, they oficially said that they did it for only one metro line, but for me its really working well on different lines;;
That's great;;
But i guess it depends, most of the time when I am using a train, I tend to stay around 45 min to an hour, so it's nice to be able to actually do some work or read news or such;;
yeah, but you can do it with mobile internet without wifi, that what i meant <@87241615671832576>;;
sorry for not responding quickly, i dont pay much attention to discord when im not mentioned in message;;
It's okay <@207416847019016202>. In general I don't get a good signal, when travelling with trains;;
well as i said i meant in-city trains that are part of metro;;
its not like suburban;;
so reception is good;;
but i understand what youre saying;;
between cities reception can be shit or absent;;

<@488734758847905803> yeah also possible about Tyrion;;
Yeah why not  <@488734758847905803>;;
Good morning all you wonderful people!! üòÉ;;

What's going on today?;;
Morning <@287320205020102667>;;
Hey <@87241615671832576>;;
yo <@87241615671832576> !;;
Same old <@287320205020102667> busy with work and life lol. How about you?;;
Have I told you my pick for who will be on the iron throne? <@488734758847905803>;;
I don‚Äôt think they are going to die they probably will bring them back or they will piss a lot of people <@488734758847905803>  <@416803598173995018>;;
Pretty much the same minus life because my life is work lol üòÇ;;
no you havent <@416803598173995018>;;
maybe;;
but George RR Martin already said he hated the ending lol;;
<@557380058566623233> if they stick true to the comics for avengers, people will die. Game of thrones, they dont care lol, they kill everyone. <@488734758847905803> Ill DM you so to not give any spoilers;;
coolio;;
True <@416803598173995018>;;
Im not ready for anyone to die in either avengers or game of thrones lol. Like Im excited and so nervous;;
Lol, the new format of movies and series really make people nerveous üòÑ;;
6 years ago, there would not have been anyone important being killed;;
today it's more common for the hero to die than survive;;
lol yeah for sure;;
Yes that is true;;
Haha good that I watch only sitcoms;;
Lol for real? <@207416847019016202>;;
Mostly yeah  <@557380058566623233>;;
ultimate sitcom, main chars die all the time, with canlaughter;;
I watch movies, but don't watch non comedy shows  <@557380058566623233>;;
Generally;;
There are rare exceptions;;
I watched Westworld and.... and something el see...;;
Westworld is pretty good;;

I haven't touched unity in like 2 or 3 weeks;;
It think;;
<@498246547838992414> yeah. I got here on the third of this month. PC is in the sea freight and it is estimated to get here in 8 to 10 weeks. I am so tempted to buy a gaming laptop right about now;;
;;

Damn <@300033838065778702> , gotta run from real life like the plague;;

Good job <@!417075583692963840>, your dongle just grew to 8!;;
I would build a pc.. But then i have one en route. A laptop would be a good option since my current one is absolute shite;;

I‚Äôm doing okay, and umm haha maybe. üòÇ How‚Äôre you?;;
I am good, just relaxing and listning to the kids playing raving rabbits on the Wii;;
Awwüíú I‚Äôve been hopping streams super exhausted tho;;
ahhh i understand that one, it's also starting to be a long day when doing that üòÑ;;
there's no end to them;;
that what happens when you do random irresponsible lurking;;
<@409836692158021632> thanks lol;;
Morning all!;;
Hello <@557380058566623233>;;
Hello <@!498246547838992414>;;
<:purple114Top:556843878355959827>;;
I see you changed your picture too;;
Nice;;
I have, I needed change in my life;;
I see;;
yeet;;
Lol <@207416847019016202>  do you actually follow those streamers? No right?;;
Wait is that you crim?  <@498246547838992414>;;
It's hard to keep up;;
It is <@278571432588345345>;;
It is I;;
Of course no <@557380058566623233>;;
Ohh are we all doing real life pics now xD;;
Lol I figured lol <@207416847019016202> still you were lurking there lol;;
Hello <@87241615671832576>;;
Lurking Orange and hello <@557380058566623233>;;
well i lurk because i was lurk someone i know and that someone radid someone and that someone raided someone etc. <@557380058566623233>;;
Lol I see;;
that last guy on screen is definitely because i was lurking at mango yesterday;;
i have enough connection to alwaus have some twitch tabs open and muted;;
Oh I see! I do not follow many people but I understand your point yes;;
i dont follow many people too, what it have to do with how many you follow lol;;
And your internet is very good;;
yeah of course its kinda shocking for me that in some countries there a re problems with internet;;
I understand you always have twitch going on with someone;;
yeah, almost always;;
just because why not;;
Yes here is really really bad;;
and opened muted youtube video;;
muted and running i mean;;
I understood. But why have it open if you‚Äôre not really listening?;;
With twitch I understand because you want to give support to someone but not with YouTube;;
"haha yeah lets not go so far to say ""orange want to give support"", its more like ""why not""";;
Lol;;
"and with youtube its more like ""i dont want to listen this video, maybe while it will be muted, it will end and more interesting video will start""";;
Ok;;
of course if i WANT to watch or listen something, ill just run it;;
Of course;;
I can‚Äôt allow myself that luxury unfortunately;;
I don‚Äôt have a cap luckily but still is not worth the hassle;;
yeah i dont understand why it sucks so much for some countries;;
The problem here is that there is no regulation so if you want to have good internet you have to pay a lot for it;;
well expensiveness is not so bad as total absence;;
how much for 200 mbps?;;
There is 200 mbps here;;
I think max is like 40;;
oh thats super sucks if you call 40 good;;
Hahahaha right?;;
i didn have less than 100 for 6 years;;
Yeah here it sucks;;
since i moved to moscow;;
yeah, i have no problems with big prices (for example, we discussed with changeover once that gas prices here 4 times bigger than in LA), but to not be able to buy something is really sucks;;
Yeah tru;;
Here everything is expensive and not everyone can afford it either;;
Have a great weekend everyone! ;;

Thanks <@409836692158021632> !;;
Hey <@375416862252597248> !;;
Yeah I had a blast man;;
Just going to do some groceries real quick;;
Might do a short stream today, I don't know yet though;;
I am going insane;;
But I just want to say thanks to everyone who stopped by yesterday!;;
It was a fucking blast;;
Why?;;
Also, in the near future, there will be new and exciting stuff happening in the streams! Get ready;;
Y'know I slightly dislike dogs, right?;;
Yeah;;
You freak;;
So, my stepsister got a new one;;
Hm;;
And she still has the old one, it hasn't died yet;;
So, they're both battling, barking and shagging eachother;;
And I am going insane;;
That sucks;;
On the other hand;;
I'd love to have 2 dogs;;
Dogs are awesome;;
No;;
Allow the love to penetrate your heart;;
And pet those good bois;;
Dogs hate me back;;
I will kick them instead;;
No!;;
Stop that!;;
Kidding;;
I wouldn't do that;;
They'd eat me;;
Lol;;
What kind of dogs are they?;;
One is a maltese, and the other one looks like a sewer rat;;
I don't know the race;;
Lmao;;
New rule, no hating on dogs in this discord;;
omg the reveal of the respawn game!!! you guys watching?;;
wait what??;;
they just put up the trailer for the new game;;
where can I watch?? <@557380058566623233>;;
it looks pretty good;;
i saw it on acg;;
Oh fudge. I have to leave then. Or stay forever silenced....;;
but ea star wars twitch and youtube;;
is it the jedi fallen order game?;;
yes;;
oh nice! I will check it out, I am super excited for that.;;
the trailer is good;;
i just hope the game turn out as good;;
Just watched it. Oh my godddds;;
yes right?;;
Yeah me too but respawn is a very good company so I‚Äôm hopeful;;
Ea worries me a bit though;;
yes they are for sure;;
exactly my thoughts;;
They already said it‚Äôs single player driven, no multiplayer and no micro transactions but anything can change. I‚Äôm going to stay hopeful about it;;
EA more like EAD;;
Eat A Dongle;;
Wow;;
yes but I think if they change it too much is gonna be a riot they already have a shitty reputation;;
In hopeful as well!;;
lol <@207416847019016202>;;
Where's orange?;;
Did you summon him?;;
*oh no*;;
oops sorry <@!498246547838992414> wrong imput;;
Haha, okay, got it;;
it was the O, lol;;
Yeah;;

agree!!!;;
*Lego star wars the complete saga*;;
<@557380058566623233> I loved Lucas arts games so much;;

Oof;;

yeah lol;;
I love star wars in general <@416803598173995018> I still remember watching the original movie on the movie theater it was like ohhhhhh!!!! I was 7 I think;;
I didn‚Äôt love ea‚Äôs battlefronts at all. I do love Star Wars though. I also remember watching it as a kid, didn‚Äôt see it when it first came out but it‚Äôs my all time favorite movie series;;
They did put the originals back in theatres though and I went to see them;;
they are something else specially for the time they came out;;
Absolutely;;
George Lucas has his hand in the one coming out in December too. I‚Äôm glad about that;;
ohhh didnt know that interesting;;
man;;
i feel so bad for george lucas;;
those prequels were not as bad as everyone says they are;;
Good job <@!488734758847905803>, your dongle just grew to 35!;;
ooooh yeah;;
they are not but the originals were tall shoes to fill;;
i actually loved prequels way more than original moveis;;
that is true <@557380058566623233> ;;
but i actually almost agree with <@207416847019016202>;;
really? <@207416847019016202>;;
for some reason i just didnt like progonal at all;;
I feel the prequels were just as good at least;;
*original;;
mmmm maybe is a matter of age? hahahhhahah;;
i watched originals at least 3 times... shit for me, hate them;;
as I said I saw the original first one on the theater and it left a big impression on me;;
1st episode my favourite, but maybe because i saw it in childhood;;
exactly;;
and originals i watched just 6 years ago for first time;;
maybe that was it then;;
they just confirm  game is out nov 19 this year;;
exactly is the awe fact <@488734758847905803>;;
i hope it's good;;
nov 15th sorry;;
me too;;
no probs;;
but guys;;
how did you let me do that karaoke?;;
i was just checking out the vod;;
and omg;;
how did you watch that?;;
we love you <@488734758847905803> and you karaoke are awesome fun;;
aw thanks so much <@557380058566623233> !! ‚ù§;;
i'm glad you guys had fun then haha;;
cause it def wasnt for my singing skills hahahaha;;
i had fun too though;;
that is the thing you know, it is not your singing is the whole stream package. you have a great community with friendly people and your streams are fun;;
it is a different thing that everyone else <@488734758847905803>;;
thanks so much <@557380058566623233> !;;
you guys make this great;;
for real.;;
When i started streaming, i never thought i'd meet so many amazing people;;
especially not so quickly;;
i am in so  many discords;;
and i see that this is truly the best one i'm in;;
we can work on harmonizing this week <@488734758847905803>;;
like, it's not because it's mine;;
yes <@416803598173995018> for sure hahaah;;
i need it;;
be my coach;;
I should be able to hop on Friday for a few songs;;
I am a decent singer sometimes lol;;
that's gonna be cooool;;
I sounded like i was talking loud;;
"i didnt really use my ""singing"" voice";;
though I honestly kind of dont have one;;
its tough to not just talk loudly when you can only hear yourself for the most part I think. I do better when the music is louder and I really project my voice. My mom is a great singer so she taught me some stuff but Im still not good lol;;
cool!;;
when i had a band that was my biggest pain;;
to not have a good voice;;
I really wanted to sing well;;
Good morning/afternoon/evening guys!;;
Twitch sings pls! üòÅ;;
hey <@526319824704634881> how are you?;;
It was a blast <@488734758847905803> ! We need more mango singing!;;
i missed you on Jonny stream today;;
Damn.. <@416803598173995018> can sing? I can't wait to hear that!;;
that voice can do anything <@526319824704634881> !;;
sing is a broad term lol;;
and there will be more singing;;
certain songs yes, others....God no;;
BE MY FREDDIE MERCURY <@416803598173995018>;;
Hey <@557380058566623233> ! Sleep is not my friend lately...;;
and i dont mean singing;;
Tell me to sing some Incubus songs and Im good, some RHCP too;;
It depends on the day lol so hopefully Friday is a good one!;;
I wish I could be that for you <@488734758847905803> lol;;
I know! *Crying.. I missed <@278571432588345345> stream... I actually was lurking.. I opened up twitch on my phone and fell asleep..;;
damn;;
sleep is out to get you <@526319824704634881> ;;
Sleeping when you dont want to;;
when there's quality content to be watched!;;
oh so bad  <@526319824704634881> it was a fantastic stream today;;
but you need to sleep;;
woo thanks guys üòÉ;;
we'll do more of those;;
I think jonny started 11pm my time..;;
definitely <@278571432588345345>;;
yeah boi;;
our man <@278571432588345345> can hold a pitch like I can hold my dongle;;
it was 10 am my time;;
Oh..okay.. so that would be 10pm my time;;
yeah trying to meet everyone in the middle ground;;
but your timezone is bonkers <@526319824704634881>;;
your sleep schedule is really messed up right? <@526319824704634881>;;
I know hooman;;
Lately it has been <@557380058566623233>;;
I wanna sing too!! But not on camera.. lmao;;
you need to force yourself to a steady schedule or it will always be like that;;
i can not sign to save my life thank God I can dance at least hahahah;;
I am the worlds worst dancer lol;;
hahahha lets exchange a bit <@416803598173995018>;;
do you want to sing with my <@526319824704634881> ?;;
man  I am really bad at dancing too <@416803598173995018>;;
and <@467974634977886220> loooooves dancing;;
I will give up my singing voice to be good at dancing <@557380058566623233> .. dancing was my frustration back then..;;
then you need to learn <@488734758847905803>  if only for her;;
hahha;;
it's literally the one thing i'm embarrassed about;;
I can only dance ironically;;
which is why I can do the mango dance;;
I am not embarrassed about anything;;
really <@526319824704634881> too bad we are so far away or I will make a dancer of you;;
lol <@557380058566623233> that would be nice;;
like. it is really hard to make me feel embarrassed;;
yeah Im soooo self conscious with dancing and its make me that much worse;;
Yeah sure <@488734758847905803>..;;
I dont enjoy it either so;;
I know I could dance..but I'm a better singer than a dancer..;;
We need <@557380058566623233> to teach us to dance guys..;;
we do;;
stream dancing lessons !;;
dancing ironically I shall adopt this dancing style! Lol;;
I love to do it. I have get people to dance that never thought they could do it;;
Sorry I am not being modest here lol;;
I literally think i'll never be able to dance;;
Don't you have to dance on your wedding <@416803598173995018> ?;;
it's ok;;
we all have skills we can brag about;;
like me;;
True true;;
I can hold in #2 for a reaaaaally long time;;
<@526319824704634881> we might not lol. My fiance also does not like dancing;;
lol jk;;
i can't hold it for a second;;
I am like the jack of all trades.. can do a little of everything but not excellent at anything..;;
That is a good thing then <@416803598173995018>  because there is nothing worst than loving to do something and your partner doesn‚Äôt;;
that's a skilli n itself <@526319824704634881>;;
Oh! That's cool <@416803598173995018>.. perfect partner!..;;
Agree <@488734758847905803>;;
<@557380058566623233> yeah we love a lot of the same stuff but what really drives us together, is the stuff we hate lmao;;
Back in high school I could dance..but now..my body can't move anymore.. lol.. my stuctural integrity is like uncooked spaghetti.. lol;;
Hahhahah.. bonding over hate..that's something..;;
lol;;
What kind of dance are you willing to teach us <@557380058566623233> ?;;
Im making spaghetti;;

nice!;;
abssii has arrived. Party's over.Today at 4:22 PM;;
love it;;
so accurate;;
@nobody;;
^does this target nobody, ore doesn't it target anybody?;;
just played 6 hours coop in The Forest;;
pretty cool game;;
Is a survival game? Or I am wrong?  <@207416847019016202>;;
yeah pretty much <@557380058566623233>;;
Ok;;
How you find it? Good?;;
"hard to say, i feel about most of survival games pretty much the same, like ""i can enjoy it while i dont get killed and lose my progress a lot""";;
but coop improves experience;;
so tomorrow ill play it again;;
Oh cool I am not into survival game really;;
I find them a little repetitive;;
thats exactly what i meant;;
i can do several hours max;;
subnautica was an exception because its has some differences;;
Oooh The Forest has an interesting story too.. i never finished it tho <@207416847019016202>;;
I like survival games.. i can farm for hours... hehehehe;;
well we never reached any story for now;;
just intro;;
being building our wall around base;;
Subnautica is still number one for me tho;;
same;;
subnautica is way above others;;
Yeah.. you can spend a fok ton of hours building bases alone;;
Yes! Subnautica is the best for me;;
why do you use 2 accounts now?;;
dont want second copy of you to feel leftover?;;
lol;;
I havent played the forest yet;;
is it worth it?;;
depends on your price and if you will play alone or coop;;
i dont think you would enjoy it alone;;
"but in coop its like ""why not""";;
lmao;;
"especially when you got attacked, its like ""hey dude, go here, save me please""";;
pretty fun;;
hahahaha;;
nice;;
"It looks cool <@207416847019016202> but I'm not a big fan of the ""story""";;
yeah but family friendliness makes up for that <@!498246547838992414>;;
Oh damn.. I didn‚Äôt realize I was still logged in on this account.. thanks for pointing that out <@207416847019016202>;;
Good job <@!565407921085612047>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
Yey dongle growth.. nice;;
oohhh twitch sings is free for all now? so cool!;;
I'm downloading it right now..;;
<@409836692158021632> this is it! KARAOKE TIME!!! lol;;
Really, I might have download that as well;;
Yes <@508094590436507668> !!;;
I just hope it won't force me to go live when I want to sing.. hehehe;;
or require me to have a camera on;;
Agreed, lol;;
I hope it's possible to do duets without going live..;;
Ohhhhhhh! <@526319824704634881> !!!;;
I hope it goes to console as well! ;;
Karaoke time!!!;;
YEAAAHHH!!!!;;
I just did 2 songs! woot woot! No cam required and it doesn't have to be live on twitch.. yeeeyyy!!!;;
I need a better mic.. lol;;
Very nice!!! üòÇ;;
Yeah! 3 songs! 3 stars!! OH YEAH! lmao;;
Whoop whoop!;;
It's a fun game.. heehehhe;;
okay.. that took my energy away.. going to go take a nap now.. lmao;;
Ohh twitch sings and I saw the coop stream was aswell;;
how does the game work <@526319824704634881> ?;;
sounds like we'll going to har the quartet of <@278571432588345345> <@488734758847905803>  <@207416847019016202> and <@409836692158021632>;;
I imagine them doing some barbershop songs;;
good day everyone;;
<@278571432588345345> install the game..connect your twitch account..you can set up the audio and the broadcast settings in the game..;;
You can choose to use a camera or an avatar.;;
There's a go live button on the lower left if you want to go live on twitch.;;
You can sing and gain points to unlock customisation options for your avatar;;
Also after singing you can save the song and publish it for the twitch sings community to see I think..or you can delete it..;;
You can have a duet too but idk how it works..never tested it..;;
Btw..good evening/morning/afternoon everyone!;;
hey <@526319824704634881>;;
i think i mentioned once that some discord voice feature can voice every message you receive;;
so now im playing the forest and listening to youe messages lol;;
Hey <@207416847019016202>;;
Lol..that would be a long ass message.. plus a jumpscare if everything is too quiet then suddenly the pc voice reads the message..;;
exactly. i was scared when i first heard voice read a message;;
Does it announce who sent the message too?;;
yes;;
Lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
How does it read my name? Lol;;
p o key t zero said;;
Hahhahha...nice;;
lol i will send you recording of this later;;
Yes pls.. lol;;
So have you encountered some part of the story in the game yet? Or just building base still?;;
still building;;
wanna join?;;
Thanks.. but sadly I need to do stuff üòî;;
<@526319824704634881> sadly twitch sings doesnt work for duets currently (I tried with rej);;
It's only done via recordings;;
Not in real time;;
Good morning all!;;
Morning <:kif_salute:423748007025180672>;;
Morning <@278571432588345345> <@557380058566623233>;;
Is twitch sings open to everyone now?;;
Yes;;
Ooooh;;
But theres no real time multiplayer;;
I know what I'm streaming next then haha;;
You record and the other sings over the recording;;
Yeah, I've seen a few people stream it;;
With the duets and stuff;;
Yeah duets are not real time;;
Hello <@!498246547838992414>;;
So a disaster;;
But its ok for single player;;
Maybe it'll come later, who knows?;;
Maybe;;
Yeah, I'd just stream the singleplayer anyway;;
Lmao <@87241615671832576>;;
Hey <@329001373670572044>;;

Why not crims?;;
Hey <@557380058566623233> !;;
Hmm, Idk <@488734758847905803> I liked the clean sleek look of the other one, with the white and stuff;;
But I also like the look of this one;;
Hmm, I can't choose lmao;;
Perhaps my profile pic will just be me dabbing;;
I think there's a way to make this one look cleaner;;
If you add a white line around the black line of the shield;;
Because the colors are a bit similar;;
Okay, I'll try that <@488734758847905803>;;
It does look better <@488734758847905803>;;
Thx for the help;;

6 years with that good looking mango ‚ù§Ô∏è <@488734758847905803>;;
And almost 5 years married.;;
And more to come.;;
I wish you both thousand more! My parents hit 50 year anniversary this February is a rare thing nowadays;;
wow how old are they?;;
<@207416847019016202> at least 50 I'd imagine.;;
yeah i thought so too;;
Hahahaha guys;;
would be too weird if they are younger than 50;;
My dad is 83 and my mom is 73;;
83 wow;;
my grandma is 89;;
I imagine remember I am a lot older than you;;
not a lot;;
only 16 years;;
Yeah not a lot true;;
but when i was born you already could do dominican underage porn;;
Hahahahaha;;
which makes it big age difference i agree;;
The difference is more marked when you are young not so much now;;
yeah i agree;;
several years difference when you 25+ is nothing;;
Exactly;;
but if its like 7 and 15, its a lot;;
Yes that is a lot of a difference then;;
Morning everyone;;
Age are fascinating aswell, when you are 15 a week is a lot of time. When you are 30, it feels like it's only 2 days if something like that.;;
Haha yeah;;
Morning   <@87241615671832576>;;
Disney Russia for some reason will not give out any copies of new avengers in english language to movie theaters;;
There will be only Russian voiceover copies;;
Which is very strange;;
Well of course, Russian voiceover is 99.9999% of all copies here, but There s couple of move theaters in moscow that shows in original sound. And one of them already sold tickets, but after sent out letters saying that Disney will not give copies;;
It does sound very weird. I have no clue if it's just conspiracies, but i wonder if the English version have some references to something which are not well received in Russian, such as homosexual references ?;;
I can't even see where there would be extra expenses from releasing it in English as well;;
But it might just be me and my prejustices;;
I think you generally wrong saying that homo references are not well received here lol;;
Especially amongst only two people who prefers original language;;
And I agree that I don't think there is extra expences;;
I might be wrong, I only know what it happening in the political perspective and from what is being reported, so it's quite a narrow field of view;;
So are you one who prefer the original language or du you prefer movies being in Russian?;;
Here it's normal to just go with the english, as most are never really dubbed, unless it's targeted kids;;
Here's nobody goes with english;;
And nobody know it;;
But it's weird to ask me since I even chose to stream in english, which nobody here does;;
I prefer any original language in any movie/show/game more than 12 years now;;
Hate voicover;;
Sometimes people are not rational, I do prefer a good dub. But there's so far between them, that I prefer the originals even if it's japanese.;;
I don't prefer english, I prefer original. That's why i find very weird when somebody playing jrpg in english;;
To me it's about how I am immersed in a media. It's pretty basic, just as if the original are bad, but the dub are great I prefer the dub.;;
"to be honest i didnt get ""I prefer the originals even if it's japanese""";;
what is so bad in japanese?;;
for me, first, original is original, so it doesnt matter how bad it is, let me checkout by myself;;
and second, russian voiceovers are always terrible;;
to me it's about understanding, as a person who have grown up by reading subtitles my whole life I am pretty tired of it. So it the subtitles are crap I will go to a dub instead. and I do not understand Japanese, so it's not that easy for me to just chose what to do. It's either sit down and concentrate and read subs or sit down and listen to the dynamics. ;;
It's weird how they can be terrible, when you do them all the time. By okay, subs have also really gone down hill in the later years due to crappy algorithms.;;
"to be honest i didnt understand ""if the subtitles are crap I will go to a dub instead""";;
how is it possible that subs worse than dub?;;
you can find subs from dub version;;
but generally here all subtitles are way better than dub;;
because russian voiceover people they just dont care, they making up a lot of jokes and phrases on their own;;
Okay. If I am watching an anime in Japanese I can't understand what's being said. And if the Subs are crap, they will not make any sense and you'll get a disconnect from what you see and what you read. If the Dub is good on the other hand the dub will actually explain a lot more than the subs are able to.;;
This is where I am choosing between subs are dubs. ;;
;;
The subs in Denmark have been really bad after the access of streaming services, because we are a geographically small linguistic area. So there's a lot of direct translations, which makes a lot of the stuff you read make no sense at all, because the algorithm tries to do slang, without actually knowing the context.;;
But Danish dubs tends to be pretty good on blockbusters.;;
normal sit coms, not so much. It's pretty horrific all over;;
"dude, ""If the Dub is good "" that means somewhere exists sub version from this dub";;
i agree that subs can be terrible, i just dont get how voicover can be better than subs, because you just can find subs from voiceover;;
But that's not how it works, the dubs and sub are two different entities. at least here in Denmark;;
well where you generally find subs?;;
they are on the streaming service. I do not find them, as they are a part of the package;;
hm;;
"and speaking about politicians and homosexual... here its just a leverage point for politician, like"" saying ""you dont want your children to be gay"" will raise your rating in eyes of stupid old people who watch tv";;
but generally i feel that nobody here is really against gays and such;;
its more for politicians, they love to speak about 2 big problems that europe want to bring to us -gays and pedophiles;;
and of course grammas in front of tv are very frightened;;
but nobody here will judge if gays will be shown in movie;;
we even have this term here, gayrope, which means gay+europe, and in russian it sounds exactly like europe;;
in english it doesnt sound so similar;;
that's the thing. I only watch from an outside perspective and the thing about homosexuality was also only because it has crept up before with movies. We had a lot of reports of problems with homosexuality. I have no clue, what the correct picture is, I just remember how Beauty and the Beast got a 16+ rating, because Gaston and le fou allegedly where in a homosexual relationship in the remake.;;
lol;;
and even this I am not sure, if it's just nonsense;;
to be honest i for myself hate when gays just forcingly are included in some games;;
like, you know, some male hero casually mentioning that he has a husband;;
üçø;;
"for me its just ""they did it so nobody would be offenced""";;
<@207416847019016202> I think it‚Äôs definitely better than it being thrown in your face, but idk, i wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with it being normalized;;
True but it's for anything. It does not make any sense to establish Lara Croft as a multi billionaire if you don't use it for something.;;
Just like I've never understood why a character as TinTin was established as a reporter, but he NEVER reports anything.;;
<@87241615671832576> I think his dog is the real reporter tbh;;
haha it might be. It's the predecessor to Detective Pichachu;;
Very possible. All I remember as a kid is the one episode of it where to dog drank a bit of the alcohol from the flask and got drunk;;
Good job <@!251866600548859905>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
yeah, geenrally im not against anything. just dont like when its not written in well in story and lore;;
That‚Äôs fair, I hate generally when anything is horribly written in. What I really hate more so, is when fans can‚Äôt take criticism over the game though. Always makes it difficult when I post a review online lol, but some of their opinions are kinda funny;;
"well i never comment on any video saying ""hey, dont critiqie this game"", so im not an angry fan, but if someone causally mentions that ""that game was shit"", and i loved it, i usually close video";;
I can only agree in that sentiment. even though it also depends on the context again. ;;
when Blizzard annouced that Soldier 76 was gay and had a love affair, which he had to terminate I quite liked it because it was some background story and something, which can make sense if how he actually respond to certain situations. But if it just had a been a random fact drop I wouldn't know what to do with it, beside being annoyed at the outrage culture.;;
^ agreed, I mean more when I review something in a post. I stay away from doing video reviews because I go off topic too much. I stick to gameplay so I can point out things I enjoy and things that bother me throughout the game.;;
<@87241615671832576> can agree, if made some new story for the game, and it didn‚Äôt change anything else or ruin anything, it settled in just fine so I quite liked it honestly. Same with the tracer one, it wasn‚Äôt that big a deal, but I think if they handled her a bit more like soldier76 it would‚Äôve been better;;
I think the idea is to try and give all of the characters a familiar background, so we know they are diverse in nature and even if they are on the same team they'll have different perspective of their life.;;
It's funny, when Overwatch as announced I was all in for making videos of the lore. I had hoped it was more than just a dripfeed.;;
Definitely! It‚Äôs good to have an understanding of each character;;
And lol, I feel, gotta get the hype while it‚Äôs there;;
to be honest i dont think its hard to well write all characters from the beginning;;
when they add little details here and there, i hate that;;
it feels forced for me;;
it's a valid opinion;;
Good morning all!;;
Morning everyone!;;
How are you all doing?;;
morning <@557380058566623233>  <@488734758847905803>;;
Hello <@488734758847905803>  <@207416847019016202>;;
Good job <@!557380058566623233>, your dongle just grew to 14!;;
Hey <@207416847019016202>;;
Hey <@557380058566623233>;;
morning;;
Holy that dongle grew quickly;;
Ohhhh 14 nice;;
Morning <@87241615671832576>;;
so much growth;;
yeah dominican dongles know their ways;;
Lol;;
if streaming had the same growth it would be easy to live of dongling;;
I am a chatty person I think lol;;
That's just good, a good Discord server are a server with chatty people;;
Hahaha;;
That's very true;;
TRUE;;
Hey everyone;;
hey <@416803598173995018>;;
Hello <@416803598173995018>;;
Hey <@207416847019016202> and <@557380058566623233> how are you both?;;
Yo <@416803598173995018>;;
Oh I see how it is;;
dont know about both, but separately im good;;
Doing well ready for my vacation that start tomorrow, how about you <@416803598173995018>;;
Lol;;
will you go somewhere? <@557380058566623233>;;
Nope just lazying around reading and gaming and stuff;;
My nephew coming from Spain to visit;;
He is the other gamer of the family so will have fun with him even though he is only 10;;
Hey <@488734758847905803> you watch GoT last night?;;
<@207416847019016202> thats good;;
Yeah I did;;
Got disappointed as hell as well lol;;
Niiice <@557380058566623233>;;
<@557380058566623233> oh nice! Just getting to work a bit ago, no vacation for me lol;;
<@488734758847905803> why disappointed?;;
Do  you celebrate Easter in Russia <@207416847019016202> ;;
Yeah plus Americans are workaholic <@416803598173995018>  vacation times are minimal;;
<@557380058566623233> normally I would say yes but I work for a company that was founded by a guy from Europe so we have an unlimited vacation policy and they say most people will take up to 5 weeks a year. Its very different at my job, they allow us personal days etc too. Its really nice;;
I worked 11 years in same company and only after like 7 years I had 3 weeks vacation;;
Oh nice <@416803598173995018> I wish I had that;;
i dont, but other russians do <@557380058566623233>;;
i think its not about country, its about religion;;
russia is orthodox ,  but it means same religion holidays;;
yeah its nice, you cant abuse it and take time all over the place but I think I took over 3 weeks off last year and I started in July;;
Yes and not <@207416847019016202> because the government gives the weekend of even though is religion holiday in America too is like that and other countries as well;;
yeah most companies are like how you described above <@557380058566623233>;;
It sucks <@416803598173995018> I couldn‚Äôt even take the 3weeks together because they didn‚Äôt allow it;;
Heres easter work-free because its always on sunday;;
Yes is like that always but here we usually have of from Thursday on that week <@207416847019016202>;;
we got enough holidays in may;;
basically most of first 10 may days are work-free;;
<@557380058566623233> yeah a lot of places are like that here and you only get 3 maybe 4 sick days and if you take more, you get in trouble. Its very awful if you ask me;;
Yes agree <@416803598173995018> I hate that workaholic mentality you have a lot of money but can enjoy it that is why the culture is so consuming oriented;;
Workaholic culture are also deverstating for everyone. The turnover of imployees are crazy and countries like Japan, which are all about work has crazy high suicide rates;;
i hate to work but when you have a lot of work i appreciate workaholism more than some lazy morons;;
So it's just hard to retain experience;;
I love to work, but having brakes are important;;
and i heard that in most of europe stores closed like in 7-8 pm.;;
no offence <@87241615671832576> , but i woumdt want live in such a shitty place;;
It needs to be balance can‚Äôt everything be just work you mind can not handle that;;
yeah;;
"balance, like,""not to die while working""";;
Depends on what kind of store we are talking about <@207416847019016202> most groceries in Denmark close around 9PM outside of the big cities;;
in the big cities there's always a couple of store which have 24 hour open;;
and yes balance is important;;
The stores are open yes but people don‚Äôt overwork;;
well most grocerie stores here work at least till 11pm <@87241615671832576> ;;
lazy ones - till 9-10;;
by here i mean in every russian city and village;;
I am not sure in the rest of Europe but in Spain you have a month vacation for sure even if you just started working on the place;;
so when i hear about closing at 9 pm im shocked;;
i have at least two 24/7 small stores near my house, and several till 11-12pm;;
You weren't disappointed <@416803598173995018> ?;;
There are gonna be 6 episodes;;
We waited 2 years;;
I am not sure because I have not lived in Spain for a while now but back when I did very thing opens till 9 or 10;;
For that?;;
you have to remember the city I live in right now have a store which are open till 9 PM and we are only 3500 in the city. But if I go 15 min in a car I will be in a store in a major city which have 24 hour open. There's no reason for them to have open till 11 PM, when there's no people comming to the store.;;
But yeah <@557380058566623233> when I worked in Spain and Italy the store where never open. They opened at 8 AM had a midday close from 12-13 PM and closed at 18 PM;;
<@557380058566623233> yeah that‚Äôs why I want to move to Europe lol;;
<@488734758847905803> I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all. Thought it was a great setup episode for the season;;
True <@87241615671832576> no point of being open if people don‚Äôt go at that time. Also people rearrange their schedule according to everyone schedule don‚Äôt know if I explain myself here lol;;
It depends on the city <@87241615671832576> I lived in Seville and the Madrid;;
Madrid you find a bunch open till 11pm;;
But yeah midday always close for napping time lol;;
I get it. We had a huge warehouse, which tried to do 24 hour for a year and what they dicovered was not an increased in customers, they discovered their employees had more time to make it neat and pretty.;;
guys seriosly. what you fucking mean when you say theres no point to be open????;;
no matter size of the city/village, theres a lot of people who wants to buy something when its late. what they should do? where they should go?;;
whey will go in that one store that is OPEN;;
Our point is <@207416847019016202> that people get used to the open time so they don‚Äôt buy at night;;
you know, people get used to all kind of shitty service;;
The city i live in are completely dead after 20 pm. There's none in the streets;;
When I was living in USA I used to go to the supermarket at 12 midnight;;
Loved it not to much people about;;
True <@207416847019016202> lol;;
I'd argue it's more about density of people in an area and the work hours, than the opening hours in itself;;
Agree <@87241615671832576>;;
why does the work hours matter? ;;
its 11 pm. i want to buy something. thats all, give me store;;
That is because you are used to it <@207416847019016202> if you never have that you don‚Äôt expect that. But agree, it is nice when you can do it;;
As I said I used to do it when living in USA;;
i would agree if no country in the world would do it;;
the thing about Denmark is, we are 5,6 million people all in all with 1,5 centered around Copenhagen. The rest are spread around and the density are pretty low. The 2nd biggest city have 250000 inhabitants, these cities have store open 24 hours and gasstations where you can buy. I live in the vacinity of the 3rd biggest city with 170000 inhabitants.;;
but when you know that USA does that, its kinda stupid not to do it imo;;
generally. i would say russians are pretty workaholic nation overall;;
Not necessarily I much prefer a not rushing kind of living I miss that of Spain;;
oh no i hate that;;
thats why i love moscow so much;;
city is crazy;;
Is the artist in me I guess lol <@207416847019016202>;;
Moscow the 2nd big apple;;
and i know i would love new york if i ever had chance to go there;;
Yes exactly like New York;;
yeah!!!;;
Madrid is supposed to be a big city but is never like that;;
I think is a cultural thing;;
"for me new york is the best in the world (theoretically, never been there), but all who wants say ""dude you would hate it"" can fuck off right  away,  i love moscow very much and i know exactly what my feelings towards new york can be";;
because i love big crazy never sleeping city;;
even though im not at all party type of person;;
Would you ever give Los Angeles a chance you think <@207416847019016202> ?;;
i just love feeling of nobody around noticing you and caring about you;;
i would visit it. but its definitely not for me <@488734758847905803>;;
i visited enough russian (and not only) cities to be able to understand will i like city or not;;
I see;;
i mean, to understand what does city look like in comparison;;
Most American cities are like that just not that crazy;;
well i need THAT amount of craziness;;
I personally like the idea of knowing the people around you. In all the big cities I lived in I didn't even know the nightbour, because they did not have an interest in knowing who they lived besides;;
Lol I used to but not anymore lol age I suppose hahahaha;;
I agree <@87241615671832576>;;
I don't know any of my neighbors who live on my floor;;
well im totally different <@87241615671832576> ;;
i never know people who live next door to me;;
And there are 6 apartments per floor in my building;;
I would love big city advantage with small city living;;
 they did not have an interest in knowing who they lived besides;;
exactly me;;
That's what great about talking to others üòÉ Your worldview gets totally scrambled;;
Agree <@87241615671832576>;;
i agree with <@488734758847905803> heres usually 3-4 appartments on the floor, and i never know any;;
and i lived in last appartment for 5 years;;
That's what i hated about living in major cities;;
But i totally get you like it;;
I don't really like it;;
I prefer to know people as well;;
Never being in Denmark <@87241615671832576> by my nephew loves Copenhagen;;
Copenhagen are pretty, but a bit hectic to me. Everytime go into the city I get stressed like crazy because of how fast everything has to go. So I am not cut out for a true metropolis like Moscow or New York üòÑ;;
I stay on the Net, it's better;;
Lol agree <@87241615671832576> just for vacationing;;
True I love city vacations, but i am more into the old world stuff;;
A lot of people in Russia also hate crazy cities, and hate moscow a lot, even those who moved here. Well all I can do is laugh about their misery, since they have to live here due to big salary and such. Because I am really enjoying it;;
I know none of my neighbors here. Everyone is closed off and doesn‚Äôt even say hi or anything. I don‚Äôt mind, different from what I‚Äôm used to in Boston where you knew everyone around you though lol;;
+1 point for LA;;
-100 for boston;;
But it definitely depends on person;;
;;
true that;;
Welcome  <@372627691628658688>;;

<:whattho:557321833578364939>;;
It's fucking autocorrect;;
HAHA;;
lol;;
I was saying fuck you;;
ah right;;
you forgot <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
lmao;;
<@207416847019016202> yeah I liked my neighbors back in Boston. They were nice and we hung out sometimes. I wouldn‚Äôt be friends with any of my neighbors now though lol so I like that they don‚Äôt talk to me;;
Elevator in my part of building is very tight and what's more important, it's only one task at the time. So for example if 2 guys want to go to 3 and 7, they can't just both press their buttons, because if 7th will press first, elevator will got to 7 and not to 3. So you need to communicate and find out which floor second person is going to. ;;
That's why whenever there other person waiting for an Elevator, I'm going on my foot;;
And I'm not sure what's the correct word, Elevator or lift;;
In Russia it's lift;;
Ahh ok. That‚Äôs weird, here it just goes to whatever floor is first. So even if you pushed 7 before me on 3, it would go to 3 first;;
Well this lift is for 32 appartments;;
It's not a lot;;
So lift is cheap and simple;;
In business centers of course there are never such lifts;;
But in appartment buildings some lifts are one tasked;;
It's not much of usage per day;;
For example I use it max 4-5 times a day;;
Ahh ok yeah that‚Äôs not a lot;;
Welcome <@372627691628658688>;;
Both words are correct <@207416847019016202> lift is British elevator American;;
<@416803598173995018> Boston is a beautiful city;;
Hm.;;
 In russia elevator means that thing when stairs run automatically;;
Oh no I'm stupud;;
Oh weird;;
That's escalator;;
Lol now it is;;
Elevator is totally different thing in russian;;
<@557380058566623233> yes it is. I miss it everyday;;
Really?;;
Why did you move then?;;
cause he's a dummy!;;
That's what I thought   <@488734758847905803>;;

we should take bets on the over/under for mango beating him in 4 hours;;
Ohhhh let‚Äôs;;
hahaha;;
yeaaah;;
I bet it's more;;
nah jk;;
it's less;;
oh man, brilliant idea <@416803598173995018>;;
otherwise I'm just a failure;;
It will be less;;
3 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds;;
Lol <@416803598173995018>;;
llooool;;
$20 a person?;;
Whos down? love me some gambling;;
damn...big baller ChangeOvahhh;;
Damm big time;;
Lol;;
And here I was sitting yesterday for one hour on the first boss in Dark Sould III;;
it's crazy how mini-bosses are so impactful in Sekiro;;
I have one friend who quit playing the entire game just because of a mini-boss General;;
I almost won $2000 on the masters this weekend. If Tiger and Koepka had hit their birdies putts, I would have. Fuckers just had to miss!;;
lol;;
that sucks;;
almost as much as golf sucks itself;;
Yeah I was not happy lol;;
Hey!;;
you suck;;
I fucking love golf lol. Never used to;;
goooooooolf;;
suuuuuuuucks;;
*strums guitar*;;
yeaaaaah;;
gooolf fucking sucks;;
I'd rather have my dick in a duck;;
it would hurt, but I ain't going soft;;
It'd be better than playing golf;;
YOU SUCK;;
lmao;;
what did you think of my song?;;
I only really got into it cause my father in law loves it and it was a good thing for us to bond over but thanks for crushing that dream for me now;;
now I hate my father in law;;
"I call it, ""Change the Steve over""";;
lmao <@416803598173995018> hahahaha;;
sorry;;
lol jk;;
you still suck though;;
My voice does, yeah;;
my voice sucks just a little less than golf;;
watching golf does suck lol. Playing golf is frustrating as fuck but when you play well, its really rewarding;;
I mean, you can say that about almost any sport;;
playing golf probably is fun;;
but watching it....;;
my lawd;;
there's a reason people dont know tiger woods in Brazil;;
The masters is fun but thats really the only one I watch, just cause its so huge;;
thats what she said!;;
playing golf is fun but its really difficult;;
THE MASTER DONGLE;;
IS SO HUGE;;
lmao;;
nailed it;;
<:Emote_DONGLE_MASTER_112_00000:543050254157873173>;;
ok;;
time for me to write my novel now;;
and be a big-boi resposnsible;;
on being a dongle master?;;
on being a dongle failure more like;;
lmao I thought you were streaming?;;
I will be;;
in 3 hours;;
ahhh ok;;
Go be a responsible mango;;
yesh;;
yesh I will;;

Wassup chat;;
Hey <@345984543246909442> whats going on?;;
Nothing much just chilling <@416803598173995018> how you doing bro;;
Just sitting here at work, slow day so far but thats not bad lol. Dont wanna start the week with a crazy day;;
I don‚Äôt work till tonight lol;;
I got home at 8am & I just woke up lol;;
You work overnight shift?;;
He bro;;
ahh ok, I used to work overnights, kinda miss it;;
I love it lol;;
working at night was really peaceful thats for sure;;
Notre dame in Paris is currently engulfed in flames. That‚Äôs really sad, I hope they can save it;;
This is a disaster;;
https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/amberjamieson/notre-dame-paris-cathedral-fire?utm_source=dynamic&utm_campaign=bffbbuzzfeedtasty&ref=bffbbuzzfeedtasty;;
They won‚Äôt save it;;
omg <@502171199850414081>;;
Yes ... it‚Äôs all over the news here since 2 hours ... half of it collapsed they won‚Äôt save it;;
omg I can't believe it;;
that is so sad;;
Yes it is even if you are not into religion there are treasures inside all lost, burnt;;
I'm glad I got to go in 2016;;
but i wanted to see it again;;
this is heartbreaking;;
They were doing renovation... they think a worker might have done a mistake but nothing sure yet;;
Good job <@!502171199850414081>, your dongle just grew to 12!;;
Finishing this hell of day on a sour note ... can‚Äôt wait to be tomorrow;;
Happy now <@409836692158021632> ?;;
yasssss <@498246547838992414> ;;
balance in the universe has been restored;;
Handsome boooiiii <@498246547838992414> !!!!;;
It‚Äôs a symbol of France too. I was lucky to visit it twice and have service there twice as well. They said they can save parts of it but all the medieval sections are gone and like <@502171199850414081> said all the treasures etc inside are gone. The stained glass windows too. This is just awful;;
Hah, thanks guys ‚ù§  <@565460806448185344> <@409836692158021632>;;
Good job <@!498246547838992414>, your dongle just grew to 24!;;
Big dongle alert!!;;
Fire still going but they say flams are less high ... hopefully yes they could save parts of it. But the 400 firefighters on the vault are having trouble getting the heart of fire;;
It‚Äôs a tough area to get cars into. I remember it being not easy to access;;
Especially fire trucks. I would think they wouldn‚Äôt fit well;;
Their hoses aren‚Äôt long enough to reach the fire heart so yes they are having trouble;;
You‚Äôre not in Paris, right? <@502171199850414081> are you close by?;;
No I m not in the capital i m far away ... like down in south east maybe like 800 kilometers away;;
Oh ok, was just curious. I have friends that are there and they are in disbelief. Such a tragedy;;
I live with the sun lol in French Riviera;;
Ahh ok lol;;
But Paris is Paris and I feel really touched by that but as almost all the French people;;
Our president was supposed to talk to French tonight because of the yellow jackets riot still going but he delayed it;;
Alright guys have a good day / night i desperately need my bed !;;
Good night <@502171199850414081> !;;
Good night <@502171199850414081>;;
Sleep well;;
On a brighter note;;
I'm gonna be live in 5 minutes!;;

#unleashthemango;;
Was up guy;;
Thanks to my favourite waffle sandwich for wonderful hanging out on my stream today <@498246547838992414> <@565460806448185344>;;
You guys are fucking awesome;;
<@488734758847905803> <@416803598173995018> <@87241615671832576> <@409836692158021632> are okay too;;
And that thing about Paris is really almost making me cry;;
And that comes from a person who would not care if a lot of people would die now;;
Haha <@207416847019016202> thanks, I enjoyed having my soul drained lol;;
Yeah, It sucks from Paris <@207416847019016202>;;
But the stream was fun indeed!!;;
yeah it was, thanks <@!565460806448185344>;;
<@207416847019016202> same here man. I got really emotional at work. So fucking tragic;;
yeah;;
what really pisses me off, some dude 200 years ago (which basically stone age for me now) wrote about that building, and it was there for several ages, but now, in super high tech 2019, nobody can save it;;
like what if hugo would know that some morons in 2019 (no offence to paris fire squads) will not be able to save it;;
;;
hey welcome <@441072549070241835>;;
<@207416847019016202> yeah I thought the same thing;;
yeah;;
Im sure they will rebuild but its not the same and it will take years and so much money;;
yeah;;
Hey <@441072549070241835> ! Thanks for joining us under the shade of the mango tree!;;
Lmao <@207416847019016202>;;

i was working on website;;
Greetings;;
hello <@488734758847905803>;;
hey <@!498246547838992414>;;

hello <@!498246547838992414>;;
getting ready for vacation!!! I will finish work early today and then nothing till next MOnday. Also almost done with Octopath;;
how cold is there <@87241615671832576> ?;;
today in moscow is 10 celcius;;
yeaaaaaaah <@557380058566623233> !!;;
already at the end. Then I can finally put all my atenttion on Sekiro;;
you'll need it haha;;
Around 5 in the wind and shade <@207416847019016202>, not bad but I'd prefer 10-15;;
i agree <@87241615671832576>;;
15 is fine weather when there is sun;;
well its cold for summer;;
but when you suited up well for spring, 15 is very warm;;
I don't like warmth, I prefer winter, but 15¬∞C is perfect for me;;
yeah generally i agree. but 20 is better;;
20¬∞C I can handle, but over that It's a bit too much for me;;
lol <@488734758847905803>  I know right?;;
I miss winter here is like 24C on winterüò©;;
Jesus <@557380058566623233> bit much that;;
Maybe like at 4am or 5am it will go down to 18 or 19C but only those hours after that up again;;
and of course Summer is a nightmare so I am dreading it already;;
That's still a lot;;
For winter that is;;
And don't get me started on summer;;
Last year was literal hell;;
summer must be crazy for you <@557380058566623233>;;
it got up to 37-38 in january;;
but that ws only one ay;;
day*;;
30¬∞C - 36¬∞C for me <@488734758847905803> it was a heatwave;;
I nearly died;;
So bloody warm;;
here it can go up to 45C easily;;
Daaamn;;
holy shit;;
Remind me to never visit you lol;;
lol;;
and very humid;;
at least not there;;
lol yep;;
Thank God we have fantastic beaches to go with the heat;;
That's nice at least;;
indeed;;
No beach here in DC lol;;
oh you live in DC?;;
I went there for a weekend in 2016;;

Yeah right outside;;
Oh I lived in Maryland for 8 years <@168923132630007808>  I absolutely adore DC;;
Near dulles airport;;
Honestly I'd rather go back to where I was born;;
Seattle;;
but my dad was government so they moved us out here;;
Way back when;;
Seattle is a beautiful city;;
I love it;;
i love DC though so many things to visit;;
That's true. I love the museums;;
yeah it was a super cool visit for us too;;
I'm so hungrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy;;

I was supposed to clean the house this morning but I got distracted;;
distracted;;
Playing with his dongle;;
üò≠;;
I couldn't help it!;;
<@!498246547838992414> ;;
we have a pretty big fighting game community here at work;;
we play Dragonball Fighterz, Street Fighter V, Soulcalibur 6 during lunch everyday;;
we're all trying to figure out how we can play MK11 here since it's super super violent and our office is a kid friendly space ;;
üòÇ;;
I actually got into an argument with a jerk in the epic rap battle discord haha;;
Oh damn <@409836692158021632>;;
Gonna have to tint some windows;;
<@409836692158021632> say the blood is ketchup;;
And oof <@488734758847905803> how come?;;
I am at a tier where you can give suggestions for the upcoming battles;;
Oh cool!!;;
"And I gave some suggestions that I thought were decent at least. Then the guy just said ""no""";;
Ok, no biggie but kinda annoying. ;;
"Then some other guy gave an idea and he also said ""no""";;
"Then I said ""Spiderman vs Nathan Drake. It could be cool since they both rely on comedy and fight bad guys and such""";;
"Then this same guy says ""so the connection is that they are funny? Amazing""";;
And I was like motherfucker;;
"So I said ""easier to just dismiss ideas than give some yourself?""";;
Then he said Tarzan vs Spiderman;;
Which I hate to admit is a good idea;;
"But then I said, ""why not give that suggestion instead of being rude to someone you just met? Positivity goes a longer way than negativity""";;
And then he stopped answering;;
What a nob;;
good day everyone;;
Good day <@329001373670572044>;;
Its Mr.handsome belgian;;

Sup <@417075583692963840>;;
Is the discord patreon exclusive? <@488734758847905803>;;
Thanks <@409836692158021632> ;;
When I was younger I would have just tried to insult him back, have a better comeback or whatnot. But now I just prefer to overcome douchiness with positivity or kindness;;
It is <@498246547838992414>;;
Hey <@417075583692963840> and <@329001373670572044> !;;
hallo <@488734758847905803>;;
Hey mango;;
Oh okay then;;
What's up with you guys today?;;
The lowest tier is 5 usd;;

i am trying to finish the first dlc in nioh;;
It's because they are 100% independent now;;
Oh nice <@329001373670572044>;;
Nothing much, playing games, hanging around;;
And yeah, I think it's good that they're independent;;
Im doing grade 8 social studies early republic vocabulary;;
Ez;;
<@488734758847905803> ;;
you handled yourself very very well;;
I would've suggested a rap battle featuring his mom or something...;;
Lmaaaao;;
That would have been hilariois;;
Rap battle between your dad and your mom, oh wait that's just at the dinner table;;
haha Crims;;
Haha;;
Lmao;;
hello and good day <@!417075583692963840> and <@311684705810513921>;;
Nice crimsedate;;
Hey Marklar;;
hello <@329001373670572044>;;
hallo <@557380058566623233>;;
"Omg my phone corrected ""crims"" to crimsedate automatically";;
The invasion has begun;;
lol;;
Lmao;;
we also got bug fighting community at work <@409836692158021632> ;;
but its mostly me destroying others morally;;
hahahaha;;
omg <@207416847019016202> ;;
you're one of those soul crushing devs/programmers that QA hates!;;
QA: this is a bug;;
Orange: no, your whole existence is a bug;;
in typical orange fashion <@207416847019016202>;;
Lmao;;
i also have a big QA history, so no, i crush not judging by role, but by quality of work <@409836692158021632>;;
and they still really love to work specifically with me, because that way its better and quckest;;
ah ok;;
I have respect for that since you know what happens in QA;;
I've had arguments with devs who didn't know what the hell the QA and game development process is...;;
"y'all know the term ""build"" is a version of the game right?";;
I had one Producer at Disney, walk into one of my team's meetings and this happened...;;
Producer: Hey, guys, we're on a deadline. why are you all here just doing nothing?;;
Me: We're waiting for a build;;
Producer: What are you building?;;
What.the.actual.frock???;;
"and they love to work with me because its exactly opposite of wht you mentioned. i usually help with bugs a lot more than others, who saying like ""i dont know,. it should work""";;
What are you building?;;
MADE MY DAY LOL;;
that's a true story <@207416847019016202>;;
a Disney, frickin Producer who gets bonuses when their game releases on time and hits their benchmarks;;
did not know what a damn build is...;;
in our work, we dont have distinction between QA, consultants, analytics. even tech support is the same guys;;
so we have 4 programmers, and all others;;
oh that's great <@207416847019016202>;;
and all others are whatever you want;;
and I'm glad you're one of the helpful devs who fixes bugs;;
guys who talk to clients, who write technical tasks, who test it, and stuff;;
of course we have sells person, and kinda project manager;;
but mainly 90% of company are technically competent;;
sql and stuff;;
but thing is that when i was in their position, i was way better, so i cant tolerate when they do their job badly, writing stupid tasks and stuff;;
that is amazing! does your company have a social influencer position?;;
ours just started looking for one and we've had mixed reactions on the job posting and arguments about the actual job itself...;;
why does this job exist? hahaha;;
what is that lol?;;
social influencers are instagram, youtubers who have millions of followers who promote products ;;
Kylie Jenner from the Kardashians, for example, gets paid half a million for 1 post about your product on Instagram;;
"you'll see them on your instagram feed, selling ""flat tummy tea"" or what not";;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
haha;;
we got social networks now i think, but we sell our products only to business, so its another kind of work;;
its easier in some ways;;
big companies just need some software, and not always able to develop it and keep up to requirements;;
by requirements i mean that most of our products are meant for integration with goverment IT products, so you need to integrate by the law;;
you can do it yourslef or find someone who already have software, like we do;;
government IT products.... hmmm.... ü§î ;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
<@488734758847905803>  are you streaming today?;;
you better <@488734758847905803> !!!;;
haha;;
i dont stream on tuesdays usually;;
but I might stream tonight;;
I think he is hiding <@409836692158021632>;;

Ohhh;;
Nice;;
hahaha;;

the new World War Z game looks great;;
looks like a cool game to stream with buddies too;;
yeah i agree;;
I'd buy it if i had a pc;;
it's on console too $40;;
TRUE;;
but I only know people who bought it for pc haha;;
oh...you need better friends;;
console friends;;
are you gonna get it <@409836692158021632> ?;;
I might...it looks really fun;;
after Sekiro maybe;;
if you do, i might;;
ok, I'll let you know;;
watching UnholyWayz play it solo right now and it's tons of fun to watch;;
I bet it'll be crazier in multiplayer;;
yeah I agree;;
it looks like a lot of fun;;
man i'm watching the sopranos for the first time;;
holy shit it's so good;;
wait? for the first time?;;
duuuuuuude;;
yeah.;;
how you doin?;;
hbo is expensive here in brazil;;
haha I hear yeah;;
you'll love it;;
"and i just had so much to watch that I just thought ""meh, it's an older show""";;
but holy fuck;;
it's almost as good as twin peaks haha;;
hahaha;;
i'm bummed the lead actor died in 2013;;
yeah James Gandolfini is one of my fave actors;;
yeah he seems really good;;
one thing I dont understand though;;
is why HBO's apps and site and shit suck so bad;;
theyre way more expensive than netflix;;
yet their stuff is so user-unfriendly;;
you want to fast forward on netflix? you hold the button ;;
if you want to do the same on hbo, you gotta hit the ok button on a 10 sec forward icon a million times;;
11 pm <@488734758847905803>  what time is now there? The Soprano is a fantastic show;;
<@488734758847905803> there's a scrubber that allows you to fastforward or go back on HBOGO aside from the 10 sec buttons;;
it's 3:15pm;;
on the phone app there is, but not the tv app <@409836692158021632>;;
really? ah that sucks;;
also, the platform to find new shows and stuff in general on the phone app is shite imo;;
Its 1:14 pm here;;
yeah, the overall UI of that app is pretty bad;;
you should try True Detective Season 1, <@488734758847905803>;;
I have watched that;;
amazing show;;
oh nice;;
matt mcconahues (I know that's not how it's spelt);;
performs amazingly;;
woody harrelson too;;
or whatever;;
I'm t elling you <@409836692158021632> you are gonna love twin peaks;;
ok that will be 12 midnight for me then <@488734758847905803>  luckily I am on vacation after 5 pm today;;
I've watched the first season of Twin Peaks. just finished that yesterday.;;
haha nice <@557380058566623233> !!;;
ohhhh nice <@409836692158021632> !;;
dayumn;;
what did you think so far?;;
I'll start Twin Peak season 2 next then we'll discuss üòÇ;;
I have to see twin peaks. is a great show;;
it is really good <@557380058566623233>;;
one of my favorite shows of all time;;
<@488734758847905803> ;;
I'm not really a fan of David Lynch's quirkiness;;
but towards the later episodes of season 1, I started liking the characters;;
it felt like a Twilight Zone-esque murder mystery because of how weird it is;;
I prefer the True Detective type style;;
it's a good show but not my cup of tea;;
Ah I see. ;;
Then perhaps you won't like it too much after season 2;;
Cause season 3 gets a bit odd. ;;
I absolutely loved it;;
But I understand then;;
I thought since you liked the OA you'd enjoy some strange haha;;
I liked the strangeness of OA since it was grounded with angels and stuff;;
It's David Lynch's weirdness that I don't dig;;
I'll finish season 2 and watch the new season as well;;
I'm invested and want to see how it all plays out üòÇ;;
Haha ok;;
I still think you'll like it to some degree;;
Because the story is really good imo;;
Even if there are some parts I found bizarre;;
the underlying core of the story is cool and has some similarities to True Detective imo;;
the fact that the sheriff assumed the boyfriend was the killer kinda made me think of Serial and the whole Adnan Syed case;;
I just felt that the characters were caricatures and not grounded or believable and this is why I look at it as a Twilight Zone-esque type of story;;
only in an alternate universe where David Lynch's weirdness reigns could these characters exist;;
still a good show, don't get me wrong;;
The OA's characters were all very grounded and believable;;
"you could trace each of their motivations and go ""yeah, I can see that and believe that""";;
I just couldn't see that in Twin Peaks;;
characters were weird for the sake of being weird;;
Sorry  <@409836692158021632> I changed my pfp, but I made this and I'm gonna fokking use it;;
no worries, Crims!;;
I know, I'm only joking haha;;
Just finished Spec Ops The Line. Thanks everyone who dropped by today;;
<@!498246547838992414> ;;
<@537319907541516311> ;;
Thanks you for experiencing ending with me;;
<@557380058566623233> ;;
<@526319824704634881> ;;
And thanks to you amazing mark for another sub <@409836692158021632>;;
It was a pleasure <@207416847019016202>  you guys should work around each others stream so we can watch you all;;
haha;;
its enough that i need to find time for streams in my real life;;
if i would schedule it with others i think i would never stream lol;;
Lol true <@207416847019016202>;;
Great game <@207416847019016202>;;
Sad that I only caught the ending..;;
haha yeah;;
Good day everyone;;
Hey yo <@311684705810513921> !;;
how's it going/;;
Just started my day here on my side of the planet.. ;;
How's your day going?;;
been going pretty good;;
just hanging out today;;
Hello <@311684705810513921>;;
how's it going <@557380058566623233>;;
Officially on vacation, so great <@311684705810513921>;;
gang gang;;
Just finished The OA season 2 üëÄüëÄüëÄ;;
hahaha <@526319824704634881>;;
Downloading Twin Peaks s01 rn.. heheheh..;;
Woooooooot <@526319824704634881> !;;
Yo <@441072549070241835>;;
Niiiice <@557380058566623233>;;
Hey <@311684705810513921>;;
When will season 3 of the OA coming out <@409836692158021632> ?!!!!!!!;;
Probably in 2 years;;
2 years?! Nooooooo;;
Are there only 2 seasons of Twin Peaks <@488734758847905803> ??;;
3;;
2 from the 90s;;
And one from 2017;;
And a movie!;;
<@526319824704634881> ;;
Netflix hasn't confirmed if they will greenlight season 3;;
since season 2 was just released so it's too early to tell;;
however, the creators have mapped out all 5 seasons of the OA (if it ever gets greenlit that far);;
If you like the first 2 seasons, I'd watch  the movie. The first 30 minutes are kinda bs and boring;;
But then the movie gets exciting;;
Hmm;;
I'm sure it will <@409836692158021632> ;;
Unless one of the seasons gets super baf;;
Bad;;
I didn't research anything about twin peaks..so I hope this isn't a love story bs mango.. hehhehe;;
yeah I bet it'll get a season 3 as well;;
Yeah definitely will have season 3... It's very intriguing..;;
but it's good to know they laid out all the seasons from beginning to end  before presenting it to Netflix;;
so that they'll have a complete story and not try to come up with stuff as the seasons progress;;
True , that makes a big difference in my faith in it too;;
Btw, late-night stream confirmed!;;
HECK YES <@488734758847905803>;;
You just made my night;;
Boooo yaaaa;;
yes...I need your Sekiro streams in my life;;
Another couple hours and I'll be live biotches;;
Ohh yeah <@409836692158021632> ;;
And I need your jokes inside me;;
I mean;;
My life;;
In my life;;
oh...um...okay?;;
Yeah, call me;;
ooof;;
Oof;;
Yeiiii!!!! <@488734758847905803>;;
Yeeeeeyy!!!;;
Don't tease us mango!;;
Yyyeeeeeeeeeeettttt;;
Hahh;;
I would never tease you!;;
I'm gonna have dinner and do it up!;;
But I can't scream cause it's gonna be late;;
Fok!;;
ohhh quiet, ASMR Mango streams;;
Hahah;;
Now wait a moment;;
There will still be rage;;
Just more contained;;
Think caged;;
On a silver stage;;
Turning to the 69th page;;
While burning this mage;;
In 18th century Prague;;
On your channel that I subbed to and paid;;
I request that a refund must be made;;
From watching your streams every day;;
I'd rather watch a dog getting spayed;;
üòÇ;;
Lmao;;
lmfaaaaaao;;
JK <@488734758847905803> ;;
I wanna see that amazing Sekiro pace!;;
you're mowing down bosses faster than any of us here;;
Good job <@!409836692158021632>, your dongle just grew to 22!;;
heading home now!;;
I'll try and stop by your stream when I can <@488734758847905803> ;;

hey @everyone - just booted up the stream!;;
https://twitch.tv/purplemango_gaming;;
;;
impromptu stream is up!;;
come check out the deaths in sekiro;;
#unleashthemango;;
Argh;;
Had to restart my PC because it was lagging the game image;;
Whyyyyyyy;;
I test streamed and it was fine;;
I wish counter tech issues man was here;;
Morning everyone;;
Morning  <@87241615671832576>;;
I was reading your chat in ACG general for a while, but didn't find interesting topic to jump in lol;;
That's fine :) People are going nuts on PS5;;
You finished Black Ops?;;
Yes!;;
Finished it yesterday;;
Thinking about what to stream next;;
Maybe Forgotten Anne, it got pretty cool story;;
It does, and it deserves more exposure üòÉ;;
and love;;
Haha yeah;;
I agree;;
So maybe it will be that;;
Or maybe some other;;
I want to stream point clicks to be honest;;
But not slow ones;;
turned on some World War Z stream... why does that game looks exactly like Division??;;
It's more like left for dead. I am not sure how it look like division besides being in 3rd person;;
dont know, overall look of characters and stuff;;
Morning all!;;
Morning <@557380058566623233>;;
Morning <@207416847019016202>;;
hows your vacation;;
So far busy lol <@207416847019016202>;;
Buying some paint for the office;;
And doing chores for the house;;
Lol;;
sounds boring;;
i love just to sit there and play;;
Yeah right?;;
Some vacation lol;;
yeah;;
But after that is going to be sitting and playing trust me;;
i dont;;
i think you will waste all your time on some sekiro-like shit;;
Hahahhaha isn't that part of sitting and playing?;;
You think is going to be rather raging and quitting?;;
<@207416847019016202>;;
More like crying and suiciding  <@557380058566623233>;;
Lol;;
Not being able to beat sekiro in 29 minutes is disgrace I think;;
That is why you always have back up games;;
Lol damm;;
That's why i don't play games that give me challenge;;
Lol;;
I do both so I can keep my sanity;;
And not shame on go down on easy mode. Unfortunately Sekiro doesnt let that;;
exactly;;
Everyone everyone.....I have a special announcement.......ready? I think you are AWESOME! I hope you have the best day ever!;;
Hey all;;
Hey  <@416803598173995018>;;
Hows it going? <@207416847019016202>;;
Good;;
Heading home to stream something;;
Nice! I will try and check in;;
Cool, thanks  <@416803598173995018>;;

Okay, I will forgive you;;

I will not get a tattoo ever;;
Because F that;;
Agree with waffle boy on that;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Can‚Äôt commit to something permanent on your body?;;
Yeah;;
Why would I do that, it's stupid;;
Yeah that‚Äôs fair;;
Still think <@!498246547838992414> should get a waffle tattoo;;
He should do ratio of years on his face;;
Autocoreect;;
Tattoo of tears;;
Yeah there you go. It‚Äôs decided <@!498246547838992414> orange has spoken and you must comply;;
I don't need a tattoo of them when I already have the real thing;;
*dies inside*;;
wasap everyone! ;;
hello Nickelsedate! <@!498246547838992414> ;;
"hello ""the voice that gets you moist"" <@416803598173995018> ";;
dobroye utro gulag master <@207416847019016202>;;
Hey everyone!;;
lmao <@409836692158021632>;;
Morning  <@409836692158021632>;;
hows its going?;;
<@416803598173995018> I was about to start calling the morgues and stuff;;
Hey <@409836692158021632> , <@498246547838992414>;;
<@207416847019016202>;;
hahahaha dude Im dying at that line <@409836692158021632>;;
should be my new slogan;;
Why would you call morgue? It turns you on?  <@488734758847905803>;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah yesterday was chaotic man;;
The voice that gets you moist lol;;
<@207416847019016202> cause I thought changeova had died;;
I can imagine;;
Oh that would be nice;;
Death of someone is best thing to bond over;;
I was about to put out an all points bulletin on ChangeOvahhh too!;;
Lmao;;
wadap Ninja Master Mango!;;
guys... <@488734758847905803> is really crushing it in Sekiro;;
out of all the people I know, he's been beating bosses the fastest;;
Did you see him holding gamepad?  <@409836692158021632>;;
oh damn...;;
I did not see him holding the controller <@207416847019016202> ;;
it was <@467974634977886220> ALL THIS TIME!!!;;
dun dun dun;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> `will the real gamer Mango please stand up! please stand up!`;;
Lmaaao;;
Thanks for the kind words <@409836692158021632>;;
Though it is hard to simulate the anger if it weren't me <@207416847019016202>;;
haha;;
I still believe Cuphead is way harder than Sekiro;;
it took me months to finish Cuphead;;
why is it hard? <@488734758847905803> ;;
fact that womango playing better and youre nothing is pretty good reason for anger;;
lol;;
Has anyone here played world war z?;;
lands and jonny;;
I've watched Unholywayz play it. It looks like a good multiplayer game.;;
it's $40 on PS4 so I might check it out;;
Hahaha <@409836692158021632>, hey <@488734758847905803>;;
Yeah that was my thoughts. My friend bought it and said he loves it so far but can see how it would get old quickly;;
Its gotten mixed reviews and I was watching a bigger streamer play it and he hated it and said it was shit lol;;
character dialogue is pretty fun;;
"one guy says ""c'mon cabron"" hahaha";;
lol kinda like octane is in apex?;;
which streamer did you watch, <@416803598173995018> ?;;
yeah, kinda like Octane;;
moistcr1tikal;;
He ripped the game apart lol;;
haha;;
"you even watch streamers that have ""moist"" in their handle!!!";;
lmao yeah hes pretty funny to watch;;
lol <@409836692158021632>;;
I cant afford it now but I wanted to get it eventually cause it reminded me of left for dead. My buddy and I played sooo much of that;;
I think Days Gone will eclipse WW Z in the zombie swarm genre;;
since Days will have ton of story behind it ;;
along with the gazziliion zombies;;
yeah world war z doesnt appear to have much of a story to it;;
I really hope days gone is good;;
do you know if its multiplayer?;;
"I want <@!498246547838992414> to change his name to ""MoistSedate"" now...";;
thanks, ChangeOvahhhh;;
single player only for Days Gone;;
i would buy days gone on day 1 if it was on pc with russian regional prices. but im not spending 60 on the game;;
that would be a great game for you to stream, Orange;;
fok all these zombies...;;
lol;;
even if i would buy it for full price, i dont have capture card and dont want to stream via ps4;;
I probably wont buy any games on release for awhile;;
Excited about the new from yesterday and PS5 though;;
gotta start saving now lol;;
I hear ya, Orange;;
you need to keep that high level Russian Quality Stream;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> `ewww console streamer`;;
i dont care about ps5. ill need it only if it will have cool exclusives;;
yeah man;;
PS5 next year!!!!!;;
I might have to decide between a PC and PS5 next year;;
go with the PC, <@416803598173995018> ;;
it'll do wonders for your stream especially when you have a camera set up;;
your sexy voice will be amplified a thousand times when viewers see that face!;;
might give waffle boi a run for his money;;
i agree with mark;;
even though ps5 would be cheaper for changeover;;
you cant tell me what to do!;;
yeah probably go with PC though, can do way more with it;;
but since he is rich ass american,,,;;
Who said waffle?;;
I wish <@207416847019016202> more like broke ass American lol;;
but I wanna see his face when talks in his Boston accent;;
and tells me to where mah cah-keys and drink some caw-fee;;
Im getting cam for ps4 in June though...;;
broka ass american still richer than any russian <@416803598173995018>;;
ah yeah! ChangeOvah gonna be a sexy streamer in June!!!;;
Maybe not after my wedding lol;;
Man it is gonna be weird transitioning from controller to mouse and keyboard;;
imo cam for ps4 is total shit. not because of cam quality, but because of available options with cam;;
hello waffle boi <@!498246547838992414> ;;
hahahaha;;
you changed your name!!!;;
Indeed;;
yeah I agree <@207416847019016202> you can only do the sony one;;
but it is better than no cam;;
I was just watching you guys talk haha;;
and you dont have a lot of options to place it on screen <@416803598173995018>;;
so fuck it;;
also I am not richer than Putin <@207416847019016202>;;
we dont know that;;
oh right, didnt think about the screen thing. Where does it go for default?;;
i think you only can place it in small corner;;
and thats all;;
you cant do it whatever you like, like on pc;;
default is upper right corner;;
but you can place it on the upper right, bottom right, upper left or bottom left;;
yeah but it cant be customized;;
only small cam hole with different shapes;;
I agree with you <@207416847019016202> ;;
it is very very limited;;
cam hole? hahaha;;
looks like this way is the only option;;
yes <@416803598173995018>;;
there's 3 other locations for it, ChangeOvahh;;
just use obs with cam fo 30 minutes and you will understand that you dont want to stream ps4 without capture card;;
<@409836692158021632> yeah but that whole bar thing is a little annoying lol;;
you can disable the bar too;;
oh really?;;
ok not so bad then;;
no, its bad;;
its really limited;;
<@207416847019016202> I would love to but I dont want to spend all the money on capture card and PC to use it with;;
yeah;;
but like Orange said;;
OBS will be wayyyyy better with all the options;;
Id rather spend a little on this setup and see if I can grow with it and then upgrade after;;
dude you dont need capture card for pc;;
so as i said, just fucking buy pc;;
dont bother with ps4 cam;;
I don't have a capture card, and I'm fine;;
Yeah how much is that though?;;
hahaha;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> `just fucking buy pc`;;
I bought a good pc, just for gaming, streaming came after;;
when are you gonna use a camera <@!498246547838992414> ;;
we need that handsome waffle boi on screen!!!;;
No <@409836692158021632>;;
Just no;;
I thought you need capture card to stream off PC? You dont need one to do alerts etc?;;
yeah get a cam <@!498246547838992414>;;
Noooo;;
Hell no;;
someday, Crims...someday;;
you can't deny the world your handsomeness forever...;;
yeah what mark said;;
Well...;;
Still no;;
of course you dont need capture card on pc;;
<@416803598173995018>;;
<@207416847019016202> oh ok, I didnt know that. My knowledge for PC is basically none;;
its just softare that does it;;
what can we do to make that happen, Crims???;;
I honestly would love to see you start using a camera;;
<@207416847019016202> ahh ok, how much is software?;;
I just don't want to use one;;
ah ok;;
I respek dat;;
Maybe in the future;;
its free <@416803598173995018>;;
oh wow;;
when you're ready;;
for now I'll stop using the hashtag #CrimsOnCam then...;;
i would never pay for software lol;;
Hahaha <@409836692158021632> I think it's entertaining lol;;
In Russia, software pays Orange;;
how much you think to build decent gaming computer for streaming?;;
I thought it was a lot of money to do so;;
wait the prices will be different in Russia lol;;
i think its not a lot, 1k+ maybe;;
i built my for 2k five years ago;;
oh yeah thats a lot lol. I was thinking to spend $250 for the cam, monitor and chair and desk for now;;
and its still okay;;
if you think that 1-2k for cool pc is a lot, you definitely dont need ps4 cam for 250;;
oh, you meant for all;;
yeah for all, not just cam;;
cam, monitor, desk and chair;;
right now I use tv and sit on my couch lol;;
Shut your cam hole;;
shut up <@488734758847905803> no one asked you;;
lol;;
Lmao;;
still, its not a lot, and you can use it for longer than some guys will decide to create new console generation;;
yeah thats true. I think I will still go with my plan. Then once I pay off debt from my wedding, I will build a good PC;;
Yeaaaah boi;;
Then we can play lots of games together on PC;;
Cause they're cheaper to buy;;
nah Im good;;
rather play with myself;;
I mean by myself;;
yeah with myself too;;
only joking , yeah Ill play games with you mango lol;;
gotta get good with mouse and keyboard;;
I figure I can spend a little to upgrade and get a cam and monitor and see where it goes. Hopefully it takes off more and I can get more serious with streaming. Rather than spend over $1000 and have it not work out at all lol. Thats my mentality at least;;
lmao;;
i'm still gonna use a controller probably;;
an xbox ontroller;;
true true;;
i dont understand... you saying it so as if cool pc is only for streaming;;
and i also always use xbox controller on pc;;
Yeah Id wanna use a controller for certain games but any type of shooter, Id probably go with mouse and keyboard;;
yeah for coop shooters i understand;;
just seems easier to aim in shooters with mouse and keyboard. Will take a lot of adjustment though;;
I havent used a pc for gaming since high school so 14 years ago almost;;
fuck im old;;
damn;;
youre old;;
it's only been... 10 years since I was in highschool;;
ewwwww;;
üëÄ;;

Medunsaaa <@510594499202908160>;;
Hello;;
I just got out out high school;;
I feel young;;
We all know you are 52 <@510594499202908160>;;
I‚Äôm actually 140;;
You just got outta highschool <@510594499202908160> ?;;
Damn. I'm old enough to be your grandfather's daddy;;
Yeah I just got out of hs;;
I‚Äôm 18 üòÇ;;
omg youre so young;;
though I'm glad i'm not young anymore;;
was gonna make a joke but perhaps it's too much;;
setting stuff up to start streaming everyone!;;
@everyone - more sekiro. let's see if we can beat the ape https://twitch.tv/purplemango_gaming;;
;;
;;
welcome guys <@411872251139588096> <@331509937328881696>;;
gang;;
What is going on? people üòÉ;;
Welcome <@411872251139588096> and <@331509937328881696> ;;
Thanks for joining us under the shade of the mango tree!;;
@everyone - thanks so much for all that love today. You guys stuck around for 7.5 hours!;;
You've all been amazing and I sincerely love streaming and hanging out with you guys. It's been so much fucking fun!;;
Awesome stream!  <@488734758847905803>;;
Thanks <@416803598173995018> !;;
Hey <@488734758847905803> sorry I had to leave early. How did it go? Did you kill King Kong?;;
It's ok <@557380058566623233> !;;
Yeah, I finally managed to. And then guess what?;;
He appeared again! In the second phase form;;
And after you kill him the third time, he calls another ape;;
What oh nooooo?;;
And then you have to face both at the same time;;
Lol;;
But I somehow managed to do that in 2 or 3 tries haha;;
You are kidding me right? As punishment for leaving early;;
Hahahahaha;;
I could not play that game, mango you have so much Patience;;
It was crazy;;
Lok <@510594499202908160> , one thing you need to have is patience;;
Though you had patience to get good at Apex;;
Which I have not had lately at alllll;;
Haha;;
It's a shame you're on Xbox and <@416803598173995018> is on PS4, you'd make a great team;;
Yeah but that is just cruel, that game you are playing üòÇüòÇ;;
Both of you could easily carry me to some wins;;
Hahahaha;;
Yeah it can get pretty bad;;
That is nuts!;;
One thing I love about it though is that there aren't better weapons or armor;;
It's just one weapon;;
And some tools;;
But there aren't stronger swords;;
Which you never use...;;
Lol;;
Exactly hahahaahha;;
I'm a simple man;;
Have you ever watched the anime bleach?;;
I'm like zaraki kenpachi;;
Don't need no Bankaii;;
Maybe they will get cross platform play soon?;;
Lol;;
Are you for real <@488734758847905803> how did you manage two of them?;;
Hahaha I don't know <@557380058566623233>;;
I focused on the weakest one first;;
It didn't have too much health, but it hit hard;;
Lord I am dreading this game;;
Lol;;
So I killed it, then managed to just be patient and kill the main one;;
Ah true <@416803598173995018> that would be cool;;
Or maybe you could get an Xbox after the wedding!;;
Let‚Äôs see tomorrow I plan on an extended game section let‚Äôs see where I get;;
Nice;;
<@409836692158021632> has helped me a looooot with his gps coordinates;;
No Xbox lol. Not enough games on it for me to buy;;
What?;;
You crazy?;;
Gamepass is amazing;;
You pay like 10 dollars a month;;
And get 100 games. Sometimes they're launches!;;
Yeah he has been pretty helpful;;
That would be the only reason to actually buy a Xbox right now;;
But not with my internet;;
Meh don‚Äôt like the controller? Lol;;
Ah yeah the controller used to be an issue for me too;;
But now I like it almost as much as the PS4 one;;
I guess Xbox isn‚Äôt expensive but I‚Äôd rather put that money towards more gear or a pc;;
Yeah for sure;;
YAYA;;
Yayaaaaa;;
That was so fucking funny. Him and I were laughing sooo hard every time you said it;;
Hahahaahah;;
Man I wish I couldve heard it;;
Hahahaha yeah I wish we could have sent audio messages;;
Morning everyone;;
Morning  <@87241615671832576>;;
Good morning guys!;;
How are we all doing?;;
Morning   <@526319824704634881>;;
Since we not one person, I'll speak for myself - I'm great as usual;;
I'm just chilling in my room..thinking on what to do...can't think of anything yet.. lol;;
There s always some cool games;;
That's very true;;
How did the stream go <@207416847019016202> ?;;
I'm resting my back...been sitting infront of my pc for about 12hrs..;;
I may play later tho..;;
Plus no work tomorrow! Wootwoot!!;;
Yay congratulations!! I am taking the kids to the zoo today;;
If you mean last stream with Forgotten Anne, it was cool  <@87241615671832576>;;
Especially game itself;;
That's great to hear :);;
Nice <@87241615671832576>;;
I lurked your stream @onemansorange.. never got a chance to watch the gameplay..;;
Coz foking timezones..;;
We need one timezone!!!;;
You always can watch recording lol;;
But I will stream it today too;;
When you asleep ofcourse;;
I don't like watching recordings.. coz I like interacting in chat..;;
"As you said.. I am very ""talkative"" üòÇ";;
Yeah..will try to leave a lurk again if I wake up during your stream..;;
Yes <@87241615671832576> !! I want that! One timezone please!;;
I totally agree, I also only chat  <@526319824704634881>;;
We are both unstoppable talkers;;
Lol;;
I'm not that talkative..;;
Yeah. I believe you;;
Let's start one stream time;;
Hahahha;;
*i don't actually*;;
No.. it's difficult to watch 2 streams at the same time and interacting in both chats..;;
It's different to watch even one person, especially when that moron reads only half of chat and miss all the meaning;;
Lol;;
Selective reading you mean?;;
That's me that's me;;
I can't follow a chat;;
;);
In that case I usually talk to the people in chat more than the streamer.. hehehe;;
You do interact when I chat in your stream <@87241615671832576>;;
And to be honest. I'd want the chat to be more interactive with each other than me xD;;
No I didn't mean you  <@87241615671832576>;;
Potato know who I meant;;
Hahaha.. you typed potato... That's cool.. ahhahhah;;
I know,I am just making fun of sometimes the chat just runs away from me;;
Good job <@!87241615671832576>, your dongle just grew to 18!;;
Like, wtf the problem to just read messages in order;;
To be honest I typed pokato... it s just autocorrect;;
You are thw opposite <@207416847019016202>.. you stop the game and read the chat..like all of it...;;
No worries.. there's no other potato here so there will be no confusions.. hehe;;
Tbh..I don't like it when the streamers I like stream at the same time.. coz I feel kind of pressured to interact in both..;;
haha well i dont care;;
and about reading... i dont read out loud everything, but i at least read it, to understand, and if i feel that i need to, i read it out loud;;
you can skip my streams all you want <@526319824704634881>;;
and mango by the  way stops too. its just for some reason he see all messages in random order;;
I don't skip your streams.. it's just that you stream when I sleep at night..;;
dont it mean that you skip them lol? <@526319824704634881>;;
Not my fault you stream when I sleep.. lol;;
Again..foking timezones!;;
Good job <@!526319824704634881>, your dongle just grew to 14!;;
Woohooo! Dongle growth!!;;
its all phillipenes fault... because it exists...;;
why do country with such a long name;;
they need to join some country with short name and adequate timezone;;
Hahhahaha;;
Philippines...the Spaniards named the country..;;
You can call it Mordor..it's shorter..;;
My problems would be solved if I were to move.. It's much easier than to convince the country to join another.. üòÇ;;
"by the way i think (i feel) that theres pretty big difference in meaning of word ""adequate"" in english and russian, even though it sounds the same. ";;
"in english it more like ""adequate to something"", like, how something fall in line with some rules or setting.";;
"But in russian it rarely means that, it usually  means like someone ""not stupid"", ""sane"", or ""not bad""";;
"basically it means ""normal""";;
Good morning;;
Oh..okay..;;
Hey yo <@329001373670572044> !;;
Hallo <@526319824704634881>;;

he didnt, he loves to play shitty mp games;;
haha yep!;;
my gawd;;
mango you doing karaoke tomorrow?;;

lol damn, I might be able to help out with some singing today if you want it then. Tomorrow I will stream last of us for <@207416847019016202> and <@557380058566623233>;;
i dont believe you <@416803598173995018>;;
you always promise and then suddenly stream when its fucking 5 am for me;;
Ill even put you in the title for it;;
youre not very good with promises dude;;
I dont make promises though;;
Tomorrow I dont promise to stream last of us but I will do it, it will be around 1445-1500 for me;;
"maybe its translation problem, but ""Tomorrow I will stream"" sounds like a promise to me lol";;
like a confirmed intention;;
"Id have to say "" I promise"" to make it a promise lol";;
oh thanks <@416803598173995018> that will be nice;;
"no, there was no doubt in ""Tomorrow I will stream"", so it was confirmed plan";;
FINE I PROMISE lol;;
"if you want to pick on ""promise"" word, okay, its not a promise, but you said youll do it, without doubts";;
im just explainin how i see it;;
im not angry with that or anything;;
I agree with orange;;
twice in one day;;
damn;;
haha;;
i can not imagine you being angry <@207416847019016202>;;
youre damned <@488734758847905803>;;
you mean angrier than i usually am? <@557380058566623233>;;
lol whatever guys! I will stream last of us tomorrow and put orange in the title of my stream;;
apex today though;;
lol;;
you say you are angry I just don't believe you lol;;
I have 5 chapters left to go on it;;
ooooo snap;;
cool <@416803598173995018>;;
whoops meant 6;;
I think  <@557380058566623233> has a feeling that orange's hate is all just an act!;;
it might be;;
*gasp*;;
it is his superhero cover;;
lmao;;
disguise I meant;;
*Anger Man*;;
let me explain a little... <@557380058566623233> ;;
i know how to talk to people, so i dont come off as random emotionally unstable person, who just angry all the time and such...;;
and im actually pretty friendly sometimes, especially when i stream;;
"but under all of that i have a lot of pretty strong built-in opinions, like ""i hate when people do that, when people say that, i think those people deserve to die, i dont feel bad for anyones misfortune"" etc etc etc";;
so, sometimes, when i show just a little tip of that big pile of hateful thoughts, people notice and start saying that im angry;;
which is not untrue;;
I understand you perfectly <@207416847019016202> believe it or not I am closer to your opinions I also hate stupidity I do not go as far as deserve to die but i know exactly what your mean;;
its  just some discussion we had with mango...;;
it came to that i would like person who rob me to die, if it woulndt have any legal consequences for me;;
and I am not a soft hearted person;;
and mango said that those people still doesnt deserve to die;;
I don't go as far as person who robs deserve dead but I do say person who kills definitely do;;
well i think mango defended even his potential killer;;
and what is entirely 100% true, i really dont feel a lot of empathy. or any;;
we discussed it a lot with mrs orange, so i know exactly that i dont have that thing;;
lol;;
i see;;
you must have some if there is a mrs orange <@207416847019016202>;;
maybe we define empathy different;;
i dont think so;;
for example, if someone feels pain, i dont feel bad for them;;
if its mrs orange or someone else close to me, i feel strong responsibility to participate and help;;
and i therefore i care;;
because its kinda my area of responsibility;;
that is some measure of empapthy;;
yeah maybe;;
but i speak of other kind of empathy;;
i understand;;
all that general empathy that a lot of people naturally feel for really anyone;;
in general people feel bad for other peoples problems and such;;
YES;;
that what i mean;;
you can say that mrs orange explained that to me;;
that people do that;;
and i dont;;
is important that you at least care for those close to you though;;
"well thats why i dont use ""care"" word in this case";;
im trying to distinct empathy to natural feeling. to explain that i dont feel that often;;
but im very responsible in all kind of promises and such stuff;;
i understand;;
Just met another Russian in the building <@207416847019016202> last name was Riazantseva, couldn‚Äôt even pronounce it lol. She didn‚Äôt know you though...;;
lmfao;;
she didnt know you;;
goddamn;;
I actually asked lol;;
She looked super confused;;
I have guy at work with that last name, Riazantsev. Maybe they are relatives?;;
is it an uncommon last name?;;
Haha no uncommon, just usual;;
oh;;
<@416803598173995018> you just made my day !!!;;
_waves _;;
hey <@502171199850414081> !;;
what did <@416803598173995018> do?;;
Hey <@488734758847905803> how are you ???;;
lol maybe they are relatives? <@207416847019016202>;;
We got a lot of last names that you can understand it's Russian by the form of it, even if you never heard it before;;
I'm well hbu?;;
hm;;
Hey <@502171199850414081> ! How‚Äôd I make your day?;;
That's what I said  <@416803598173995018>;;
learn to read <@416803598173995018>;;
you stupid americano;;
Oh sorry I meant like yes, maybe they are. Didn‚Äôt meant to put the ?;;
¬´¬†Just met another Russian in the building last name was Riazantseva, couldn‚Äôt even pronounce it lol. She didn‚Äôt know you though...¬†¬ª I am still laughing;;
You‚Äôre American too! <@488734758847905803>;;
That's why i thought that michelle molitov is a dude. Because molitov is 100% Russian male last name, even if I never met anyone with such name;;
Lmao ohh ok <@502171199850414081>;;
ah ok haahhaha;;
yeah that was a great joke;;
I'm more brazilian than american now <@416803598173995018>;;
You‚Äôll always be American bro;;
I was drinking and almost choked;;
I feel the force of rice, beans, and football flowing through me;;
Hahahaha;;
FOOTBALL;;
"not ""sokker""";;
Lol;;
or whatever you call that handegg sport;;
Sucker;;
nice;;
She looked so confused when I asked <@502171199850414081>;;
do you know this really hateful guy from Moscow? Orange? One Man's Orange is his full name;;
Omg i would have paid to see her face lool;;
gotta go write;;
stop distracting me!;;
with your being interesting and shit;;
Excuse us M translator !!!;;
Lol yeah I said oh I know someone from Russia! Maybe you know him, his name is orange;;
I need to be in a more boring discord so I can live my life;;
lmao <@502171199850414081>;;
Well stay in mine Mango lol ont 3 of us here;;
Only*;;
Wow it's crowded. It's only me and mango in mine;;
Also the fact that you said Brazilian and not Brasilian definitely means you are more American <@488734758847905803>;;
Still debating with myself if I wanna play and go live or no;;
Morning mangos have a good day guys;;
Oh well <@207416847019016202> at least <@488734758847905803> joined yours !!!;;
He didn't have a choice;;
I held him by the balls;;
You got the power lol he was in mine but he left without a word;;
Lmao;;
Yeah he is bad person;;
That's why I'm trying to piss off everyone here so they would leave;;
Nah he is not ... it‚Äôs probably me that‚Äôs why he left;;
He is discord slut. And as every slut, sometimes he feel bad and trying to play virgin, and delete some client numbers;;
You make me feel better I know empathy is not your thing etc but thanks;;
Orange. Making people to do stuff. Sometimes- even to feel better;;
lol discord slut;;
Im in 4 other groups but only talk in this one;;
yeah, im in 8, and its already too much for me;;
yeah thats alot;;
Hey <@540105000903507968> how you doing?;;
I really bothers me when people dont respond to emails I send but send me ones and then expect me to answer immediately;;
you talk about work?;;
Yeah with work;;
in my kind of work everyone is our clients so we the ones who obliged to answer, not them, but i know what you mean, we got a lot of it here;;
Yeah this is just usually co workers but one girl in particular. I am pretty sure she hates me lol but she's not very nice and I have told her that before so;;
like, when something is broken and we point out that its broken on clients side, it can take fucking hourse for them to fix and to be silent... and if its our fault, they can continue to pnic every fucking minute;;
lol;;
all my coworkers are in same room so its not problem for us;;
and we can use whatsapp and stuff;;
ahh ok, not me. I work in a different place than most of my co workers;;
yeah i understand;;
yeah we use slack to communicate mostly;;
kind of like whats app;;
I use whats app alot though to talk to friends and family in different countries;;
Watch my dongle grow;;
Good job <@!416803598173995018>, your dongle just grew to 30!;;
i know exactly what slack is, id say from all messengers its not like whatsapp, its a lot like discord;;
Im coming for you <@488734758847905803>;;
ahh ok, I wasnt sure how popular slack was;;
we use it too, but its very slow comparing for example to discord, which is totally similar;;
slack is popular for work;;
not for personal life;;
yeah exactly. Id never use for personal reasons;;
so, oficially we use slack but it runs so shitty that for usual communication its whatsapp or skype;;
or telegram, dont know if you know it but its very popular russian messnger;;
yeah I dont really like slack. I suggested to use whats app or even discord but they didnt want to;;
microsoft teams;;
We also use Mac laptops, which I hate but what can you do;;
Hey <@375416973443727361>;;
yoyoyo;;
hows it going?;;
just workin...or trying to rather;;
IT dept sucks;;
Good job <@!375416973443727361>, your dongle just grew to 1!;;
i hate macs, but my work hp laptop is very shitty;;
I dont mind them, just had to get used to it. I hate that I dont have a monitor. It hurts my neck to look down at laptop all day;;

lol;;
(not responding);;
<@207416847019016202>  are you streaming today?;;
yeah <@557380058566623233>;;
in 10-20 minutes;;
cool;;
at what time is your stream today <@488734758847905803>;;
he cant answer you, he thinks hes a novelist;;
lol right;;
i am trying to see what time can I go to bookstore to buy my nephew his birthday present and not to miss anyone stream <@207416847019016202>;;
haha dont bother. the less people watching my streams - the less hate is spreading;;
lol i like your stream;;
plus i am trying to plan a long gaming session today;;
with sekiro? <@557380058566623233>;;
yeah I need to advance something lol;;
<@207416847019016202>;;
dont dancing skills help to play sekiro?;;
and I really really want to finish Octopath this week;;
lol;;
lol I dont think so lol;;
I will be really good at it then, if I may say so and not being modest;;
being modest is forbidden here;;
lol I think that is fantastic;;
when i started dating mrs orange, she couldnt understand how i can talk so well of myself, saying that im good at that and this.;;
but for me its okay to know your strong and weak sides. and if i know im good at somethings, its no problem for me to talk about that;;
and i enjoy to do that also;;
I dislike modesty why shouldn't people say what they are good at right?;;
agree;;
Im the same way <@207416847019016202>;;
except I do take it too far sometimes and become egotistical lol;;
I mean we are bad at a bunch of stuff as it is so why not say the good ones;;
mostly just to mess with Mrs changeover though lol;;
lol;;
"i do that also, saying ""im always right""";;
lol me too!;;
which is almost always true;;
cause I usually am;;
hahahaha;;
yeah;;
lmao;;
Mrs changeover doesnt like to admit when shes wrong though lol;;
also she gets very pissed off when she shows me some movie with a twist, and i predict (sometimes) that twist before. so it kinda spoils pleasure of sharing it with me;;
you guys are going at it wrong wives are always right.;;
lol;;
makes them happy;;
being egoistical, or admit when you wrong, its one thing.;;
but what i talk about, is just to state when you good at something.;;
"I can literally say ""im very good at that"", and for some people its like HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT ABOUT YOURSELF";;
"like the other day, we were talking about our wedding cake and we are having bavarian chocolate. I said oh so its like me, nice and German. She says ""bavaria isnt german, they arent even the same thing"" lol I said uhh yes bavaria is literally in germany. She swore up and down that I was wrong until I showed her a picture of  where bavaria is lol";;
see above <@557380058566623233> lmao;;
as far as im informed youre not wife, so youre not right, so i dont believe you <@557380058566623233>;;
yeah I agree with your statement above <@207416847019016202>;;
no ofence lol;;
lol;;
Wives are right, until they are not lol like my story above;;
i think bavaria  called bayern in english?;;
i can be wrong, but bayern munich called bavaria in russian;;
lol true but as a woman I know;;
Ive always called it Bavaria <@207416847019016202> so Im not sure;;
why would you assume youre a woman? <@557380058566623233>;;
i dont know if its too far but i like that lol;;
lol you dont think I would know THAT? lol;;
i just find very funny everything connected to assuming;;
"with a lot of morons getting offended but someone ""assuming"" gender and stuff";;
everything is one way or another;;
lol <@207416847019016202>;;
everyone is offended by everything nowadays;;
not everyone though;;
not too far for me I do not get offended easily and I dont mind those kind of jokes;;
here are the best people;;
Yeah I dont really ever get offended;;
Bayern is Bavaria in German yes <@207416847019016202>;;
in german, not in english?;;
or both?;;
oh i get it;;
german - bavaria, english - bayern;;
I think people that get easily offended is because they have lower selfsteam;;
no English is Bavaria also I think;;
German is Bayern;;
and low intelligence, but lets not talk about that, i really need to start stream;;
cool;;
no bayern is german, bavaria is english. I was confused by the question, sorry;;
whoops <@557380058566623233> already said that;;
yest hat is what I though, wasn't completely sure;;
sorry, didnt see your message before;;
no problem;;
good that you confirm;;
lol thanks;;
fuck cant find any beanies;;
orange one is still dirty?;;
don't use beanie then;;
yeah, and red one went to washlist too apparently, because i can find it;;
i love myself but not so much <@557380058566623233>;;
lol;;
your hair can't be that bad;;
;;
it isnt bad, its just not there;;
but it would be okay be total bald, but im to lazy to shave;;
lol <@375416973443727361>;;
laziness is just smart resource management;;
lol;;
shave is high maintenance;;
yea aint nobody got time for that.  WAX THAT BIHHH;;
I HATE shaving. I shave my face once a week lol. Used to have to do it every day, was the worst;;
i meant shave head;;
yeah that would suck too;;
shave face -  fuck that;;
i only shave face with head;;
I have to, cant grow a beard lol;;
ill go with the one whose color is looking very shitty on my cam;;
its ok, we will forgive you....maybe;;
that very good that i dont care lol;;
like, seriously, not caring is really cool feature;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
lol I knew you wouldnt;;
not caring is the most important thing you could do;;
definitely is in some situations lol;;
the only thing i care about, is not caring;;
wait.;;

Raw garden snails are good tho;;
space station to the head? lol;;
Yeah, some NASA fucker parked wrong;;
lol you ok? <@!498246547838992414> sounds like you need some sleep;;
Crim definitely needs sleep;;
Great stream! <@416803598173995018> sorry I had to do a raid;;
Thanks for the support! <@524820041976250368> was a great stream. Special thanks to <@526319824704634881> for sticking around the full time! Can‚Äôt wait to do the challenge next week. Gonna play apex with the Mozambique only;;
No problem! <@416803598173995018> and <@526319824704634881> is amazing! üíú;;

Okay..gtg guys! Enjoy your night/day/afternoon;;
You too! <@526319824704634881> üß°;;
Yayaayyaaaaa;;
See ya! <@526319824704634881>;;
Morning everyone;;
Morning  <@87241615671832576>;;
You're waking up really early lol;;
What did you think about that pixel craziness?;;
Yeahh the kids have me up early.;;
I liked it very much, the blend between RPG building and adventure really have ne curious;;
RPG? It has character progression?  <@87241615671832576>;;
It has a skill system where you progress you character and you get levels. Granted it's not huge, but I like the idea.;;
Hm;;
Good;;
But still wouldnt play it;;
I know, you didn't like the aesthetic and if there's something which can put me off a game that's the aesthetic;;
good morning;;
morning <@329001373670572044>;;
hallo <@87241615671832576>;;
how are you today ?;;
i am good;;
how are you;;
I am doing good as well, sorry for the late response <@329001373670572044>;;
glad to hear that;;
Good job <@!329001373670572044>, your dongle just grew to 7!;;
speaking about putting off the game, i can handle ps1 3d graphic, but low detailed pixel art is really not for me <@87241615671832576>;;
It's the exact opposite for me. PS1 era polygon graphics are horrendous to me.;;
to me too, but it was nessecity of the time, but here some morons really had decided that such a style would be okay <@87241615671832576>;;
sorry for harsh word style though;;
I definitely needed sleep <@416803598173995018>;;
But that's how subjectivity works <@207416847019016202> :);;
well of course its subjectivity;;
but lets record song with shitty vocals and lets say that for someone its okay;;
fact that for someone its okay dont make it objectively good;;
True, but I am not sure what we are talking about right now. I though it was about pixel art :);;
Yeah;;
what i meant it looks very cheap and awful <@87241615671832576>;;
and yes its my subjective opinion, but subjectiveness of my opinion doesnt make game any more prettier;;
i am stuck in sekiro right now;;
I meant its not excuse to use so low detailed pixel art;;
I liked it I must admit. Cellshading are one of the cheapest ways to do graphics today as far as I k ow;;
do it in fucking RPG maker, pretty cheap too, but doesnt look so awful;;
imo of course;;
I do get your point :) I would have preferred it being 64 bit rather than 16, but it's not that bad to me.;;
yeah i get you;;
will you stream it more?;;
Yes, I quite liked the casual relaxation in it. At one point I want to go back to Satisfactory again and Foundation;;
maybe lets try satisfactory on weekend, two of us? <@87241615671832576>;;
Could be fun if they have fixed it;;
not sure;;
i read every update description;;
"last time they mentioned that they still working on ""biggest crash""";;
Ahh okay,  I guess the best path will be to try it out;;
also they mentioned there will be new content soon <@87241615671832576>;;
also, fell free to mention me in dialogue a lot, that way i will receive notifications and will respond more soon;;
No problem <@207416847019016202> ;;
I like when there's a long way to the next content :);;
well i love idea of early access but i would prefer new content to come out already;;
it kinda killed off my enjoyment of the game when i found out that i cant upgrade to next tear due to early access;;
That's one of my issues as well. I wanted to support them, but I am not that huge fan of Early access;;
Good morning all!;;
Morning;;
Morning <@557380058566623233>;;
Morning <@87241615671832576>  <@207416847019016202>;;
Morning everyone!;;
What's everyone up to?;;
I am playing *skyrim* <@87241615671832576>;;
I've heard it's an awful drug abuse.;;
Skyrim? <@87241615671832576>;;
Happy Friday everyone!;;
Ye;;
Happy friday;;
Happy friday  <@416803598173995018>;;
And yeah <@87241615671832576> Skyrim is my *vitamin c*;;
Feeling better? <@!498246547838992414> hey <@87241615671832576>;;
I am <@416803598173995018>;;
I was a bit f'ed in the brain last night <@416803598173995018>;;
lol lack of sleep will do that!;;
hey <@!498246547838992414>  and <@416803598173995018>;;
Hello guys!;;
And gals!;;
Good morning allllll hope yall have a sweet day!!! Let's get it!!;;
Hey <@207416847019016202> how are you?;;
im good;;
Any plans for the weekend?;;
Same to you! <@375416862252597248>;;
Hello <@557380058566623233>;;
Hello <@416803598173995018>;;
Hows holiday going? <@557380058566623233>;;
Too fast lol;;
i think i will play The Forest all weekend again;;
That‚Äôs cool <@207416847019016202> let us know when you are going to do forgotten Ann again I want to see the end;;
always does lol <@557380058566623233> wish you could slow time down when you're not at work. That would be a cool superpower haha;;
Nice <@207416847019016202> I still need to check that game out;;
I will kill to have that one <@416803598173995018>  lol;;
<@557380058566623233> and <@207416847019016202> I will be streaming last of us today. Doubt I will finish but I might get close to it;;
Oh nice! At what time are you planning to stream? That way I can organize my day accordingly;;
<@416803598173995018>;;
haha nice;;
what time?;;
Approximately 1500 California time;;
If things go correctly, a little earlier;;
your time?;;
we'll see if ill be awake;;
yes my time, I know thats late for you <@207416847019016202>;;
i will tell you <@557380058566623233> ;;
i think i will have ability to stream it on weekend;;
its just last weekend was all The Forest coop;;
Would that be 1 in the morning for you? If It‚Äôs 1500 here;;
That is fine <@207416847019016202> when you are ready is ok;;
What time is now in California? 8:30am? <@416803598173995018>;;
im +11 <@416803598173995018>;;
so its 2 am;;
im always awake at 1 am, but closer to 2 sometime i can go to sleep;;
<@557380058566623233> its 0730 here;;
Ahh ok <@207416847019016202> I thought you were +10;;
-3 for me ok;;
Maybe I can start a little earlier so you can watch for a bit;;
wait;;
did LA time changed recently?;;
Yes we moved up an hour cause of stupid daylight savings;;
oh yeah, we dont have that here, so apparently its +10 now;;
means thats 1 am for me now;;
Oh ok;;
I theoretically should be able to start closer to 1445 but we will see. Need to do a few things after work and it might take longer than expected but hopefully not;;
Oh you are working today <@416803598173995018>;;
dont brag <@557380058566623233>;;
Yeah unfortunately <@557380058566623233> lol. I work Monday-Friday;;
Lmao <@207416847019016202>;;
Yeah but not closing shop on Easter damm;;
Who‚Äôs bragging??? <@207416847019016202>;;
It was a genuine question;;
you, with your vacation <@557380058566623233>;;
no it wasnt;;
dont lie to me, i can see right thorough;;
Even on America they usually close on Easter;;
Lol <@207416847019016202>;;
Good Friday isn‚Äôt a holiday for us where we would close. Easter is on Sunday for us and we aren‚Äôt open weekends anyways. Good thing is, it will probably be very slow today;;
Weird. When I worked on the State my company considered Friday Easter a holiday;;
Maybe it was just them;;
for us Easter  is also sunday, but i dont know which sunday;;
Is this one;;
But it varies every year;;
well for catholics yes;;
for here i dont know and dont care;;
Isn‚Äôt the same for the Orthodox Church?;;
maybe same;;
i just dont know;;
Yeah I‚Äôve never had Good Friday off lol;;
Man that sucks! <@416803598173995018>;;
googled it. yeah you right, it is this sunday;;
I am always right <@207416847019016202> lmao;;
Jk;;
Just teasing you;;
Eh we get lots of other days off during the year so it‚Äôs ok. Plus Good Friday is always slow so I just mess around all day anyways lol;;
check out mays work-free days in russia;;
and it doesnt mention week that i will take as a vacation;;
so it will not be very work filled month for me;;
Oh wow;;
Damn;;
That‚Äôs like what I get all year lol;;
what do you mean?;;
all year you work only half of month?;;
No, I meant as far as days off work for holidays etc. I think I get 7 or 8 all year;;
Like how we get Christmas off etc;;
oh i got what you mean;;
we also have a lot in january;;
first work day in like january 9th;;
Spain is like that too. Lot of days off in the year;;
Again, another reason why I want to move to Europe lol;;
lol i wound want to live in europe. i think its very slow for me;;
but never been there though;;
You like busy cities, right?;;
Like New York;;
Some countries are slower than others. South Europe is a lot more relax;;
yep <@416803598173995018>;;
come to moscow ill show you;;
Yeah I thought so. Paris felt very busy to me though, I liked it. I‚Äôve been to New York before, wasn‚Äôt bad but couldn‚Äôt live in the city like that;;
I‚Äôd move to Paris for sure if I could;;
i would not lol;;
Lol how come?;;
why?;;
its moscow or new york for me;;
I think Paris could surprise you;;
maybe;;
still not moving there lol;;
it didnt surprise me on distance, like NY did;;
Have you been to paris or NY?;;
nope;;
i just said that i never been to europe;;
oh didnt see that. How come? its so close by;;
lol;;
you need visa for that;;
its too time and energy consuming for me;;
ahhh ok;;
maybe in future;;
didnt know that;;
and also its expensive;;
its energy consuming for me to travel anywhere in Europe lol. Its so far away;;
dude you didnt know that to go to EU you need shengen visa?;;
no had no clue, you need passport here but its easy to get;;
"what do you mean ""here""";;
you dont need visa to go from US to EU?;;
no just what we call a passport, might be the same thing? not sure;;
passport is used for international travel;;
passport (we call it here international passport, because we call ID also passport) is thinig that you need to do any international travel. but to enter some countries you need visa;;
im sure you know that you need visa to enter US for example;;
well i need at least, not you;;
Hmm interesting, yeah I didnt know that. Only familiar with how the US passport works;;
but yeah, it domt reqiered when you travel from US to EU;;
Currently, US citizens can travel to Europe for up to 90 days without any sort of travel authorization;;
dude i dont believe that you didnt hear about visa;;
maybe I did but didnt pay attention so I dont remember lol;;
you want to go to some country, you go to their embassy, pay a lot of money just to apply for visa, then you wait time, and they apply or reject;;
it workd for a lot of countries, US included;;
and it became a lot worse for US;;
so if i want to go to US or EU, i need to put a lot of effort, filling out forms, paying and waiting bla bla;;
damn that sounds awful and really annoying;;
"friend of mrs orange is trying to receive US visa to go to some conference for work, and he had a lot of troubles because he couldnt apply, ""there was no free time for and interview""";;
also yeah, you need to go thorough interview;;
thats why i never really planned to go to US, and thats why i probably never will;;
yeah wow, thats a pain in the ass;;
enev though i love idea of living in new york, i dont want to live in russia whole life;;
I wonder how difficult it is to move from Russia to US;;
well it possible of course;;
but it pain in the ass;;
you need to receive all kind of work visa and stuff;;
to live there for a long time;;
and of course its all very expensive;;
Yeah I figured. Same if I want to move to Europe;;
some jobs do relocation, and pay for that;;
Only chance I have is to get a job that can send me there for work but that is difficult and rare.;;
I might have possibility of citizenship in Germany because my grandmother was born there but it is still very difficult;;
Only chance I have is to get a job that can send me there for work but that is difficult and rare;;
same;;
without work its hard to receive visa;;
only touristic one, but its hard too;;
i know that some people travels to Vladivostok (where i lived, near japan), which is 9 hours flight, JUST TO APPLY FOR VISA in local US embassy, because there its way easier that in moscow, because of less people;;
That is the way it works <@416803598173995018>  Americans don‚Äôt need visas to go almost anywhere;;
fuck americans;;
Europeans we don‚Äôt either;;
i hate visas;;
i only go to visa free countries;;
But Latin Americans need them to go everywhere;;
yeah thats what I meant <@207416847019016202> you need work to get visa but to get work is difficult;;
yeah fuck americans!;;
well i dont go anywhere a lot, but still , i prefer visa free;;
As  a European I can apply to any job in EU as long as I am quality;;
i read a lot of articles about IT people moving to EU, so it would be possible, but still pain in the ass;;
also we dont really bother to try getting visa for now, because mrs orange friends told her several times that she have good chances to fail.;;
i dont know if its really true, but non married, without job, and with english translator diploma - is very good candidate for illegal migration;;
so we dont bother for now;;
and if you failed to get visa, apparently its a huge disadvantage for next tries for any country;;
True <@207416847019016202> she will not qualify;;
Unfortunately;;
"i know about some ways to do it with  ""sponsorship"", when you declare that ""she goes with my money"", or something, but its another pile of paperwork";;
which both of us not ready for yet;;
And still the possibility is not high in her case;;
well yeah, probably;;
Yours if different good IT people is always welcome there;;
well i only speak about touristic visa <@557380058566623233>;;
That is the problem Americans are always suspicious that you are planning to stay there;;
They can‚Äôt phantom that you may only go to visit;;
Specially from Russia;;
my company talked about expanding to Europe, I hope they do so I can go lol;;
i understand, but i dont think that IT will matter about giving touristic visa;;
Or any Latin American country;;
No not that visa I was talking about if you decided to live there;;
no, i talked only about touristic;;
for me to live there i would need to go thorugh a lot of paper pain, but i would not pass an interview;;
why would you not pass interview?;;
because im very complicated about what random people can and can not ask me.;;
i would snap at some point, just saying fuck you;;
hahaha oh ok;;
"i left a bunch of work interview, when people started ask me something like ""where your parents work""";;
oh man, you would have done awful in a interview to be come police then lol;;
Lol yep I can very well see that lol;;
i would never become a policeman. especially in russia. system is to rotten to be good here;;
Immigration will ask you even more than that trust me lol I went through it;;
ahh I see. Yeah here it can be but the interviews are very difficult and they ask a lot of questions;;
some of them are so stupid too;;
especially in the psychological exam;;
I have a friend who tried <@416803598173995018> and is a bunch of physiological stuff;;
yeah its a lot;;
He could never passed that one and he was a very nice normal guy;;
the whole process from applying to getting the job, can take up to a year;;
"well my last interview for a job was in 2009 and it was for low warehouse worker position, so it wasnt actually an interview, more like ""you want in? ok""";;
lol;;
And still they have a bunch of unqualified people right?;;
so i never really go to interview;;
Lol;;
How did you get your actual one if don‚Äôt mind me asking?;;
<@557380058566623233> yes, so many people should not be police but are. Its a bad system;;
actual one what? <@557380058566623233>;;
Job;;
<@207416847019016202>;;
i upgraded at that warehouse to some management position, and later company intergrated there some french warehouse management system (and i participated as warehouse worker, not as IT), and integration was done by some IT guys from moscow.;;
"well, when i was fired from that company (inner political stuff), me and my brother decided that its time to move to moscow, and i contacted those IT guys and asked if there some job in their company (huge russian grocery ctore retailer), and they said ""hey go to work in our IT department""";;
Good job <@!207416847019016202>, your dongle just grew to 36!;;
haha cool message for an upgrade;;
thats when i became IT;;
we had quit that job 3 years ago, and joined new company, but its still same work and same clients, so i consider that i work here for 6 years;;
lol thats an interesting story;;
so no need for an interview, both times i was invited by the same people;;
and yeah good one to grow dongle to lol;;
I hate interviews;;
i read a lot about interviews;;
and i hate it;;
i thought of changing job 2 years ago, when i wanted to become programmer;;
but later i just became a programmer at my job;;
so still didnt need to go for an interview;;
fuck, i didnt even ask anybody to become programmer.;;
"it was like ""hey, you bosses, yesterday i discovered that orange can code. let him be a programmer"", and everybody were okay with that";;
so, im lazy;;
no interviews, no visas;;
lol well thats good at least;;
no plans;;
Good story!!, love it;;
I think I will stay at my job for awhile so hopefully no interviews either for me;;
So cool;;
I always worked for myself dancing;;
So only job interview was when moved to America and apply for a job there in a huge plumbing company as a customer service;;
Happy Friday, everyone!;;
Thats cool <@557380058566623233> I couldnt work for myself, Id get nothing done lol;;
Helped that I speak English very well already plus Spanish;;
happy friday! <@409836692158021632>;;
i have a lot of opinions about what things are dumb to ask on interview (i did just several interviews couple years back, when we recruited on some low level IT positions), so i would leave a lot of interviews, if i would look for a job now;;
hey <@409836692158021632>;;
dobroye utro <@207416847019016202>;;
ohayo gozaimas <@557380058566623233>;;
Hello <@409836692158021632> how are you?;;
Ohayou <@409836692158021632> genki?;;
Genki des <@557380058566623233> üòÇ ;;
I made it to the final boss in Sekiro so I am super excited to die a lot more this weekend! <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
oh damn lol;;
mango has got to catch up;;
with Mango's pace, he will definitely finish it next week;;
that dude is a beast;;
Oh my god so cool I need to get myself into it <@409836692158021632> haven‚Äôt touch the game this week;;
<@409836692158021632> im doing the yayambique challenge next week for <@526319824704634881>. Gonna play apex with only the mozambique and try to get a win;;
we gotta get a hashtag going for it lol;;
I saw you mention that <@416803598173995018> ;;
I'll definitely check that out hahaha;;
Yayambique;;
#MozambiqueChallenge;;
also one interesting thing...;;
as i said, i read a lot of IT articles (not read, more run through it), and some of them about recruiting and applying for a job;;
and recently i read about how russians need to go thorough foreign jobs interview, depending on if its europe or US.;;
like, generally, for US people personal gain is more important, so if you will tell about how you and several other guys did something great for project, they will not be impressed if you will not tell specifically how you were awesome at that project;;
;;
and for germany for example its other way, you need not to tell how cool you were;;
I'll try and get a clip of your Mozambique kills and use the Mozambique Challenge hashtag üòÇ;;
<@409836692158021632> lol didnt know if you saw that. Gonna be hilariously awful;;
hahah yes! Thank you, that would be awesome;;
I like your warehouse to IT story <@207416847019016202>;;
its more like IT-warehouse-IT, because i went to university for IT speciality, but after i finished i knew 100% that im too dumb for an IT;;
turned out other way lol, apparently a lot of people more bumb;;
90% of them;;
so im not even okay, im really good;;
Yes that is true <@207416847019016202> Americans value personal achievement and Europeans are more into the community stuff;;
*Europe > America*;;
Hello <@!498246547838992414>;;
Hello <@557380058566623233>;;
<@!498246547838992414> yes;;
Maybe you should try Canada <@207416847019016202> I am pretty sure you have a lot of chance there lol not your kind of country probably;;
I wouldnt mind Canada either;;
Everyone is nice in canada <@557380058566623233>, orange is not;;
thing is its never one or another, its both. <@557380058566623233> ;;
sometimes you really did something outstanding for project, but most of the time its team work;;
But they are very welcoming specially if you are good at technology;;
Agree;;
as i said, its Moscow or NY for me <@557380058566623233> ;;
never was impressed by any other cities;;
your personality would fit right in at NY <@207416847019016202> ;;
üòÇ;;
Too bad <@207416847019016202> Canada is a beautiful country;;
Agree <@409836692158021632>;;
russia is beatiful too, why would it matter lol;;
i want big crazy city;;
you are 100% right <@409836692158021632> ;;
same with moscow;;
lol yeah youd do well in NY orange;;
I would do well in a lot of places;;
i just hate everywhere except NY and moscow;;
not hate to travel, but hate to live;;
Orange in NY...;;
"Orange on the street: ""fok you!""";;
"New Yorkers: ""fok u too, guy""";;
üòÇ;;
I on the other hand will move to Madrid Rome or Paris with my eyes close;;
oh that would be awesome;;
i meant marks message;;
Yep that sounds like Orange stuff <@409836692158021632>;;
i really love huge cities because nobody care about you in the street. so you able not to care too;;
"that would be like a typical ""good morning, how are you?"" for Orange üòÇ";;
"for example, i probably never would help anyone on the street, even if they were dying, because my schedule like ""im tired and i go home"", or ""i dont want to stop cool song in my headphones"" , more important for me. and its easier to do in crazy cities";;
big city encourage people not knowing each other and not caring;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> `ain't nobody got time for dat`;;
And no one will even see you wrong for that <@207416847019016202>;;
i lived in really small city of 130k people. every time i went back there to my parents from vladivostok, even if it was for an hour, i encountered at least 1-2 person i knew;;
so ther its real about people knowing each other;;
but here in moscow its like, nobody knows and nobody cares;;
small city of 130k lol;;
thats not small;;
well depends on perspective;;
yes of course lol;;
you can walk from one furthest point of city to another in one hour;;
and inside city you can walk anywhere in 30 minutes;;
thats very small city;;
moscow has road around city (and now moscow even goes beyond that circle road), and length of that road is 100 km;;
so it would require you whole day to walk around moscow;;
by whole day i mean really 20+ hours;;
so 130k people city is really small;;
yeah compared to moscow or ny that is small;;
LA is huge. Not sure how long it would take to walk around it;;
days probably;;
well, still m theres some cities in russia with 1m+ people, and a lot of cities with 600k+, or at least 300k;;
so 130 is really small;;
yeah LA has 4 million people lol. NY is 8 million;;
also, in my experience, huge cities are more organised and civilised than small cities.;;
i mean, in big city with a lot of people you get used to some basic rules, like, when you going through pedestrian road cross tunnel, or something like this, which side you should take, and stuff like that - all that small rules required to live more organised in big city;;
and sometimes you can go to small city, and notice, for example, that people not so used to wait in line (always trying to skip it), or to wait for green light on pedestrian cross, and so on;;
is it? only 8 mil?;;
Yeah I agree with that;;
Yeah 8 million. At least that‚Äôs what google says lol;;
Yeah ok, so in reality it's more;;
Google says that moscow has 11, and it's definitely more;;
Yeah it‚Äôs probably not that accurate;;
LA definitely has more than 4 million too;;
Yeah;;
It's official information;;
It doesn't count people who are not registered in city;;
Yeah exactly;;
Hey! Great stream yesterday <@416803598173995018> you are so good at apex!;;
Thanks! <@510594499202908160> appreciate you stopping by and hanging out;;
You‚Äôll have to tune in next week when I do the Mozambique challenge. Gonna try and get a win with only using grenades and the Mozambique;;
Haha omg that‚Äôs going to be a pain!;;
Pain for those who are not on changeover, team;;
Because they will laugh so much;;
Lol yup but it‚Äôs gonna be fun!;;
Oh yeah my teammates will hate me;;
<@207416847019016202> stream is gonna be delayed. Maybe start time at 1530 for me now;;
Please don‚Äôt hate me lol. I sold a workout piece of equipment and the guy is coming at 1500 to pick up;;
haha;;
i dont hate;;
its just maybe i will be sleeping;;
because i wanted to coop tomorrow morning;;
im doing it with a dude from part of russia i used to live in, which is +7 hours to me;;
That time is fine for me <@416803598173995018>  I hope you are awake <@207416847019016202>;;
Oh nice. Wow the time zones there are crazy. Thanks <@557380058566623233> I should be able to start at 1530 my time I hope;;
not sure, not sure;;
we'll see;;
you canT trust ex cops;;
I just added all your time zones to my phone app so I can keep up wit everyone lol <@416803598173995018>;;
i just added it to my head;;
lol <@207416847019016202>;;
My head is not good for numbers;;
its not much of people  here who worth remembering any info about them (thats why i did bot info thing), but about all the rest i remember timezones;;
but dont remember any fucking timezone abbreviations;;
me neither lol;;
Good job <@!557380058566623233>, your dongle just grew to 16!;;
oh another grow;;
and also i always forget that some countries change time;;
but the orange bot is cool;;
he is;;
someday his site will upgrade;;
but now it develops very slowly because im stupid;;
Lol thanks <@557380058566623233> i do that too. Can‚Äôt remember them all like orange does;;
i doubt that very much <@207416847019016202>;;
exactly and we are in so many different places <@416803598173995018>;;
what are you doubting again?;;
"ofelia aka ""wives always right""";;
you are most definitely not stupid;;
haha;;
im stupid in frontend though;;
i have 0 experience in it, and some things take for me a lot of time;;
lol you want to trust me on that wives thing <@207416847019016202>;;
which i would do in several minutes if i had experience;;
experience and stupidity are 2 completely different things;;
i don't think me stupid but I will never be able to do something like the bot <@207416847019016202>;;
well you need to understand context.;;
of course i dont really consider myself stupid.;;
not a lot of people think they are stupid;;
and even if i could think so, you know i dont;;
"so for me to say ""im stupid in frontend"" is just figure of speeach that means ""im bad in frontend""";;
i understood <@207416847019016202> I was just pointing the obvious;;
is difficult to convey the attitude or nuances of words when you are tipping them instead of talking;;
I can only imaging what can of stuff you could come up with if has experience the bot thing is cool. to work any kind of technology stuff is amazing to me since I can t do nothing of it;;
well bot is very easy actually;;
especially for me, who has this kind of experience, even though it was first time i used that language;;
but site thing, yeah, very slow and painful for me;;
pretty sure for you was easy i can not do it to save my life;;
but then I can dance pretty good so there is that to each their own like they say;;
so we basically can save the world together <@557380058566623233> ;;
i will code and you will dance;;
lmao;;
but actually it is point of trying. mrs orange now code some stuff, and year ago she didnt know anything about that;;
true true;;
"please notice that i dont say that ""anybody can do anything"", because its bullshit";;
but sometimes you really need to try to know if its for you or not;;
even if you think its not;;
Agree on that;;
also if you have a good teacher you can learn even more than you could otherwise;;
sadly never about me;;
i dont have anyone who could help;;
only if its about work, then i have some superior programmers;;
but i would never ask them about my pet projects;;
it was just coincedence that one of them saw once my pet project and recommended me as programmer;;
because none of them knew before that i can code;;
so, if i have problems, i only can google;;
or learn by watching some videos;;
don't you trust any of you coworkers to actually help?;;
well generally i think my coworkers are good;;
but theres 2 things;;
1. my personal life is not for them, so i dont want to tell them what i do and what i code, and bla bla bla;;
2. its actually very hard to help someone without going into problem like 100% and spending several hours;;
"magical thing like ""you asked and they knew answer"" almost never happens";;
very true;;
because of 2 i often prefer to do it myself at work too, because it will be faster by myself, and theres nothing hard in my work;;
i see;;
i mean, i encountered a lot of challenges doing site, but i didnt have any doing bot, and dont have any at my work;;
yes i understood;;
coding may be fun seeing what you can create by putting so numbers and stuff together in a program but that is like alien to me;;
"yeah, when it works. its super fantastic, but i also want to mention that i dont care about shit like ""i want to create something that actually useful for people"" or such";;
"i create what i want, and it need to be useful, but no major plans like ""make world better""";;
and generally theres no numbers in coding.;;
i mean, if you dont code physics in a game, or something specific, and you just do what 90% of programmers do - some site or some app, some software and stuff, be sure - you dont need to know any mathematics to do it;;
oh then that makes it a lot more in reach for me cause I sucks at math;;
though common opinion is that you need good mathematics for programming. for some financial or scientific stuff - of course. for machine learning and stuff. but for usual programs - none;;
i know 0 math;;
when mrs orange is trying to explain me some formula im like kill me;;
lol same for me;;
<a:catpeek:537960116075364363>;;
Hello <@278571432588345345>;;

lmao;;
<:Fight_Club__Soap__112_x_112_2:548527685932941362>;;
lmao;;
I dont really know what pre-nups are tbh;;
Honestly, I dont either hahahaha;;
lmao;;
glad I'm not the only one who'ss stupid;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> `A prenuptial agreement is entered into before marriage. This agreement can set forth what will happen to your and your spouse's assets and income in the unfortunate event of divorce, separation or death. Most importantly, a prenuptial agreement can preserve the nature of property in the event the marriage ends. In other words, separate property can remain separate, instead of being subject to community property or equitable distribution laws.`;;
ah i  see;;
yeah i didnt get that;;
BUT;;
I had nothing;;
and <@467974634977886220> had some family stuff;;
so, win-win for me if you divorce me!;;
lol I didnt get it either;;
BUT;;
I do have stuff;;
damn;;
just no money;;
sounds like you might lose some stuff;;
but you won't get a D;;
if we get divorced maybe lol. not planning on that haha;;
I came into this marriage with literally nothing but my body;;
and some clothes;;
Yeah she'll get the D;;
lmao;;
if you know what I mean;;
üëÄ;;
yeah;;
hahahah;;
death-reaper?;;
lol;;
nothing but your body and some clothes. Damn I guess Mrs. Womango really does love you;;
yeah she does;;
I had just come from the states to be with her though;;
dropped everything;;
and came back;;
barely had a place to stay;;
Hey congratulations man <@416803598173995018>;;

It was just the right amount of hate;;
But don't give up, we can always do more;;
Always <@207416847019016202>;;
Sorry I couldnt do anything more than lurk <@207416847019016202>;;
That's okay, I live lurks  <@416803598173995018>;;
Really, 4-5 my usual lurkers is way better then just 0 viewers;;
*Love lurks I meant;;
yeah thats true. How far did you get in the game?;;
I didn't mention you just because you didn't participate in orgy of hate  <@416803598173995018>;;
lol next time i will try. What did you all hate?;;
What we didn‚Äôt will be the better question lol <@416803598173995018>;;
I think we will finish it next stream;;
Yeah, for that you need join stream, we don't spread hate here (all the time I mean);;
lol;;
Well <@207416847019016202> will finish it will be hating;;
I think we will finish it next 20 minutes, I just had to run;;
You actually helping a lot with the game, paying more attention then I am  <@557380058566623233>;;
You only have 20 minutes left of the game?;;
Thanks <@207416847019016202> I find the game pretty interesting even though is a simple premise;;
Deeper than it looks though;;
not nome than 20-30 minutes <@416803598173995018>;;
ahh ok, what will you play after this game?;;
i just had to end stream, needed to meet mrs orange from metro;;
im not sure, but maybe titanfall 2;;
i heard theres cool story;;
thanks <@557380058566623233> , game is really cool;;
i will think about some more games like this;;
Titanfall 2 is an excellent choice!;;
Titanfall sounds good;;
Ahh nice! That is a great game. The campaign is really good and the story is good as well;;
Titanfall 2 I mean. Its one of my favorites games to come out in the last few years;;
Is it 3rd or 1rst person?;;
Never played;;
first;;
1st person;;
Oh shut;;
Then not for me;;
i wonder if it has ability to change difficulty during game. so i could start on normal and then switch to ease as i always do;;
yeah you wouldnt do well with it <@557380058566623233> its very fast paced;;
I think you can do that <@207416847019016202>;;
at least to do it for the bosses;;
yeah some of the bosses are tough. The flying one took me a few tries but I think I had it on a harder difficulty;;
<@207416847019016202> It was fun, like always;;
Hey yo <@498246547838992414>;;
Hello ChangeUnder20 <@416803598173995018>;;
lol hows your day going?;;
Nice mod title by the way, congrats!;;
Now we can ban each other!;;
agree. it was fun <@498246547838992414> ;;
its always fun to talk shit about <@488734758847905803> and people in his discord;;
lol;;
Indeed;;
especially when hes not around;;
hes never around;;
he was supposed to stream today but hes nowhere to be found;;
as always;;
Yes;;
Mango died;;
Lol we should ask about that trip;;
i thought i will raid him, but he didnt start at time when he wanted;;
Yeah he didnt start at all lol;;
Rip mango;;
finally got robbed in brazil;;
Or stabbed;;
Sapnu puas;;
Yes;;
sapnu puas;;
i got it <@557380058566623233> ;;
to get anima i wanted to go down but lift didnt work;;
but apparently i can just go down the ladder there;;
Ohhh I see;;
we will kill it next time, tomorrow or wednesday;;
How come we didn‚Äôt see that ladder <@207416847019016202> at least I didn‚Äôt;;
I think mango was reading the plane boarding sideways like usual, and is now in Japan;;
Lol <@!498246547838992414>;;
Yes;;
It's probably true;;
when you go near that lift you dont see much of a ladder until you start to going down <@557380058566623233>;;
oh im afraid titanfall 2 will be only russian text and subs;;
fuck origin;;
Would audio be in English?;;
i hope so;;
will not play other way;;
only ubisoft can do only russian voice some times;;
origin go only with russian text;;
Ahh ok;;
andromeda, dragon age 3 - played them with russian text;;
I'd still give it a shot anyways though, it's a really good game;;
no, i dont play or watch voiceover;;
if i need it so much, i prefer to pirate it;;
Ahh ok;;
Now that I think about it, I might replay the campaign for that game lol;;
Ill stream last of us next week until I finish and then I will do titanfall 2;;
no need to replay it, just watch my stream <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
lol but if you dont play it, I will;;
no im pretty sure there will be original sound;;
i hope at least;;
ahh ok thats good;;
Having some internet troubles but they're about to get fixed;;
Will be streaming soon;;
Hells yeah <@488734758847905803>;;
I need to get up in the morningüò≠ üò≠;;

Feelzbad;;
@everyone - https://twitch.tv/purplemango_gaming;;
;;
more sekiro! ;;

Thanks <@557380058566623233> !;;
Got the win with the mozambique only! lol I contributed nothing to the cause;;
that was quick <@416803598173995018>  at least you won;;
fuck i hate all of that. theres no english sound in russian origin version of Titanfall 2;;
ive never seen this on origin, only on uplay;;
trying to download missing sound files on torrent, with no much luck for now;;
<@557380058566623233> thanks!;;
<@207416847019016202> damn that sucks;;
dont they have it on steam <@207416847019016202>;;
lol no, its EA game, they distribute their games on Origin <@557380058566623233>;;
yeah it sucks <@416803598173995018>;;
Sorry I had to just leave abruptly last night <@488734758847905803> I received a call I ended up being on for a while. I hope you had a great night!;;
by the way, speaking of easter dates, i just found out that orthodox easter wasnt on last sunday, it will be on next <@557380058566623233>;;
as i initially said, dates can be different;;
Good morning!;;
I see. Since I don‚Äôt play on pc since long time I forget that ea has his own store. And I didn‚Äôt know that about orthodox Easter, interesting <@207416847019016202>;;
well all i know its that easter always on sunday, but date itself can change;;
Yes ours always change too but also always on Sunday. I just thought it was same Sunday;;
So no titanfal <@207416847019016202> what would you do after finishing forgotten Anne then?;;
thats good question;;
i still hoping to download audio files;;
if anybody here have its on pc, they can send me english audio files lol;;
but i dont know what else i would play;;
im open to suggestions;;
except twitch sings and sekiro;;
When that game that we talked about comes out.;;
what game?;;
The plague tale;;
oh;;
not soon enough i think;;
ill play that definitely;;
Is this month I think but not sure what day;;
so no titanfall 2 then? <@207416847019016202>;;
dude im tired to answer same questions lol;;
as i said, all depends on wether i will be able to download sound files;;
but torrent is dead for now;;
it can change of course;;
so we will wait;;
or somebody here with pc install it and send me fucking files;;
its 14th may <@557380058566623233>;;
Ah ok soon then <@207416847019016202>;;
I want to see how it is it caught my attention as well;;
what funny is my vacations starts on 14 may;;
so i will not play that till 23-24;;
Ohhhh nice is ok we‚Äôll wait lol;;
haha yeah;;
i didnt know that this game will come out so soon;;
I read that don‚Äôt remember where;;
even though i dont wait for reviews, this time, if game will be shit, ill know it before playing;;
Lol true;;
ahh ok <@207416847019016202>;;
Are you into days gone at all?;;
Actually Im not sure thats even coming out for PC;;
its ps4 exclusive;;
i want to play that game, but im not ready to buy game for fucking 60 bucks;;
sounds ridiculous to me;;
ahh ok, I should have known that. yeah games are so expensive;;
lol;;
no, its okay price for US;;
but not for russia;;
$60 here is still a lot of money though;;
I dont know what the conversion rate is though compared to Russia;;
Im sure mango will buy it lol;;
Im not buying games at release anymore;;
im not sure what conversion rate has to do with it;;
we can just compare salaries and prices in bucks;;
and im not saying that 60 bucks is shit for an american, but considering salaries, you can say that its 3-4 times harder for russian to earn that 60 bucks;;
and ps4 now sells games here not for 60 bucks, but 68;;
Yeah good point, I dont know much about salaries in Russia though;;
most of people in moscow (simple jobs and stuff) make 400-700 dollars a month;;
and moscow is fucking most payed city;;
good morning you wonderful people!!! thank you again for all the love last night.. yall complete me!;;
ahh ok, yeah ok so 60 is a lot in russia for game then;;
as i initially said <@416803598173995018>;;
Good morning <@375416862252597248> sorry I couldnt tune in, hopefully I can today if youre streaming;;
<@416803598173995018> i usualy dont stream on teusdays, but i might change my mind later... tomorrow we have our art/poetry stream... hope to see yall there;;
"dude its several month already since im telling you all those examples about how a lot of things here more expensive with less salaries , and you continue to ""yeah 60 bucks a lot""";;
no offence;;
<@375416862252597248> I will try! Busy week for me but I will try for sure;;
its just, we discussed it 100 times already;;
<@207416847019016202> yeah it just depends. I used to make about 800 a month not that long ago so I guess thats why I still compare it that way. I only somewhat recently got a good paying job here. Before I was making minimum wage for America;;
minimal wage in moscow is 150 bucks;;
a month??;;
yes;;
wow;;
but mostly people make around 300-400, minimal wage is almost fake number;;
thats what im literally telling you long time;;
and dont forget that example about gas being 4 times expensive;;
yeah I understand;;
things is, steam does and did all the time regional prices, so everybody used to game for 30 bucks;;
maximum;;
and im used to;;
if its full price game, its 30 for me. if its something like half priced, its 15 for me, and if its kinda low prices, its fucking 5-7 for me, which is really price of my lunch;;
and i buy a lot of games for 10-15 max;;
bur consoles do fullprice, and as i said, ps4 even go higher, doing it EU style - 68 bucks;;
which is incredibly stupid;;
Here in Dominican is also 200 dollars the normal monthly salary <@416803598173995018>  <@207416847019016202> that is why rarely buy just out games always wait for sale and buy them online;;
Sometimes I buy new but not always;;
Yeah that is stupid <@207416847019016202> yet another reason I want to build a pc this year;;
<@557380058566623233> damn that‚Äôs crazy;;
its not that much crazy if for example local food costs less then in other countries;;
but most of exported goods still costs not less than in US and stuff;;
and plus travel costs and custom services sometimes;;
I think gta 5 is still $60 on ps4 and that game came out years ago. I wonder what it is for pc though;;
Here is just a matter of bad government and corruption unfortunately;;
so in that regard yes its crazy;;
same here lol <@557380058566623233>;;
Same here lol;;
Government sucks here;;
Local food and stuff is cheap but anything imported is nuts expensive;;
russian steam full price for GTA 5 now is 23 bucks <@416803598173995018>;;
Nothing comparable <@416803598173995018> believe me;;
Oh I know lol;;
Damn only 23? <@207416847019016202>;;
Yeah console prices are stupid then;;
"dude when im and odmt say that our goverments are bad and corrupted, have some repsect and dont say ""oh yeah here too""";;
because its not;;
Lol;;
as i said, 30 is FULL price here on steam.;;
But over the years price usually drops here on steam;;
so i bet on US steam its not more than 40-45;;
Here game prices never goes down as a matter of fact nothing goes ever down no matter what so I always buy online;;
here nothing goes down too of course, except for games and internet;;
well, internet doesnt go down in price, its just become faster;;
i used to pay 10 bucks for 300 kbit per second(10+years ago), and now  its 200 mbit/s for same money;;
Here is nuts expensive;;
fuck connection, i lost message that i almost sent;;
Lol it happens all the time to me;;
It's all good <@196807490594275328> !;;
Good morning everyone;;
never happens to me, its just work internet suddenly went down;;
and speaking about  building pc - it doesnt save from console exclusives. for that i usually take ps4 from my brother, but he doesnt want to buy days gone <@416803598173995018>;;
Good morning <@488734758847905803>;;
Hey <@557380058566623233> !;;
Yeah but I‚Äôd still have ps4 for any exclusives at least.;;
Hey <@488734758847905803>;;
Im definitely not sold on days gone. I just have this feeling that it won‚Äôt be good, I don‚Äôt know why lol just feel that way;;
What up <@416803598173995018> ?;;
I'm kinda reluctant as well about that game;;
It looks cool;;
But I don't want to buy anything before I see acg's review;;
lol;;
Same old <@488734758847905803> just at work. Ready to go home already lol;;
Yeah it looks cool but I dunno. Just something about it tells me that it‚Äôs gonna not be that great;;
you dont like last of us, you dont have the right to speak <@416803598173995018>;;
and dont lie to me, i can feel you not liking that;;
Oh shit;;
<@207416847019016202> can read minds!;;
Ruuuuuuuuun;;
you dont need read anything, can just watch his streams;;
"its like ""yeeeah, okaay, wheeere should we gooo heeere....""";;
Lol;;
I do like last of us actually lol;;
Hey <@488734758847905803> I didn‚Äôt realize you were actually moving to the States;;
Hey <@557380058566623233> , I'm not, I'm just visiting for 2-3 months;;
It‚Äôs just different and it takes me a few to figure stuff out <@207416847019016202>;;
Because I‚Äôm dumb lol;;
Still is a long visit <@488734758847905803>;;
and it makes you sleepy and hating life <@416803598173995018>;;
Lol yeah it‚Äôs just slower than shooters like I usually play but it‚Äôs still good;;
Yeah it is <@557380058566623233>;;
<@557380058566623233> he‚Äôs coming to try and live with me but it won‚Äôt happen;;
Lol;;
but i want to admit, shooting in last of us (as in most games i like) is total shit <@416803598173995018>;;
Oh yeah it‚Äôs bad. Not as bad as red dead;;
in read dead auto aiming rules;;
i dont remember if last of us has auto aim;;
You know to be honest <@207416847019016202> <@416803598173995018> the only thing I don‚Äôt like about the last of us kind of games is the stealth. I prefer going out gun blazing lol;;
I don‚Äôt think it does have auto aim;;
I HATE STEALTH in every game;;
Lol same <@557380058566623233> I sick at stealth;;
Suck;;
any kind of stealth is really not for me;;
Shooting in uncharted sucks too;;
shooting in all cool games is suck. shooting is good only in fucking multiplayer shit;;
Did you ever play splinter cell? It‚Äôs all stealth and it was fun but I sucked so bad at it lol;;
Honestly, I thought uncharted sucked lol;;
i didnt and i dont want to;;
stealth is really not for me;;
"i wanted to play all uncharted, but when i started 1st, i was bored by ""rockstar-like"" kind of shoot-outs - waves of enemies";;
i really hate waves of enemies mechanics;;
Agree;;
give me everyone in one location, that way its more realistic;;
Uncharted is a fun series though I played them all;;
rdr2 sometimes really pissed me of with those unexplained waves of enemies;;
by waves i also mean when its gta-style when they continue to chase you all the time;;
Shooting is definitely better on shooter of course but I don‚Äôt mind if the game has a good story that the shooting is not that good;;
Uncharted had unexplained enemies. ;;
It's like for 4 thousand years, no one has been here. ;;
But now there's a ton and they want to kill you;;
Lol s true;;
I only played 1st and 2nd uncharted but I didnt like either of them;;
I also didnt like red dead 2;;
but yeah I agree, stealth sucks lol;;
Wow you would be one of the few that didn‚Äôt like it <@416803598173995018> I am on the fence on rdr2;;
It's not bad but its not great either. It boring very quickly for me and then, I just lost interest in it completely;;
I am afraid it would happen to me with the slow pace the game has;;
i lose interest mostly if there no story and cutscenes;;
Yeah exactly. I have attention deficit disorder so if a game doesnt hold my interest, I will stop playing very quickly lol;;
Same for everybody, its just matter of what exactly can hold your interest;;
yeah true;;
So what game will you play now? <@207416847019016202>;;
Did you finish forgotten Anne <@207416847019016202> );;
How's the story at the endm;;
?;;
I got about 20-30 minutes of gameplay;;
He will to finish it today;;
I don't know what to play  <@416803598173995018>;;
Maybe I need to play Inside again, you would dig it  <@557380058566623233>  <@416803598173995018>;;
Ah I see;;
Inside is really good;;
What are you feeling like playing <@207416847019016202> that is more important;;
Same makers of limbo;;
No stream today, shopping stuff, I think I'll stream tomorrow  <@557380058566623233>;;
*gasp*;;
Ah ok no problem;;
Please don't say to me generic stuff like that  <@557380058566623233>;;
I know already that I should play what I want;;
No inside please I haven‚Äôt played yet;;
I know you didn't;;
Lol of course I forgot who I was talking to <@207416847019016202>;;
<@207416847019016202> ahh ok, yeah if its like limbo, then I would like to watch;;
It's basically sequel to limbo;;
What I want to play is titanfall 2, but we will wait if I will be able to download sound;;
I didnt see end to limbo unfortunately;;
What would be your second choice then should be the question;;
Not story wise sequel though;;
hopefully you can get sound for titanfall 2;;
oh ok;;
The end to limbo was a bit... Odd;;
I want to check out transistor, which is now free on epic. But I remember pirating it and I didn't dig it. So we will see;;
End of inside was odd, but I don't remember end to LIMBO lol;;
Isn't that by the guys from bastion?;;
Transistor I mean;;
What is bastion?;;
It's a game;;
I'm pretty sure the same devs;;
Hm don't remember that game;;
;;
10/10 on steam;;
Weird. It wasn't THAT good as I remember;;
youre not as good as I remember;;
youve changed mango;;
youre not ripe anymore;;
Lol go team orange;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
*cries*;;
You're not as good at changing over!;;
It was very orangy thing to say  <@416803598173995018>;;
thank you lol <@207416847019016202>;;
<@488734758847905803> I will always be good at whatever that means;;
im good at everything, ever;;
<@488734758847905803> are you gonna get days gone when it comes out?;;
Nah;;
I'm gonna wait for some reviews;;
He will wait for karak;;
Especially acg's;;
And probably play the games I already have;;
Since my trip is so close;;

Hahaha;;

May 3rd is my flight;;
I arrive in NJ on the 4th;;
And San Diego around the beginning of June;;
Perhaps the last few days of may;;
How long are you in California for?;;

No probs!;;

Happy Tuesday, everyone!;;

üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ;;

"ahhhh there it is! my daily Orange ""F.O.D"" ";;
spasibo comrade!;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Ne za chto;;
üòÅ;;
Fuck you all! How‚Äôs that? <@207416847019016202>;;
We should do a meetup <@409836692158021632> when mango gets here;;

Lmao <@416803598173995018> that gif omg;;
Such a great movie lol;;
I don't know what movie that's from tbh;;
Full metal jacket;;
Immensely fucked up movie but very accurate about the Vietnam war. Stanley Kubrick was a god;;
Fuck LA, go to moscow you pussies;;
Come to LA you fok;;
I can‚Äôt go to Moscow. I‚Äôll end up running away with a Russian woman lol;;
Ahhaaha;;
With Mrs orange if she hears your voice;;
Here's plenty for all of you;;
But you can dm Mrs Orange your sexy voice though https://instagram.com/lerashel86?utm_source=ig_profile_share&igshid=13px9dizvcy3g;;
lol I wouldn‚Äôt do that to you orange;;
I have a weakness for women with nice accents though;;
Will men with accent do?;;
No thanks;;
I like you orange but not in that way lol;;
Yeah I know, for all gay fantasies mango is the best choice;;
Nah. Too skinny for me lol;;
Then what's the problem, I'm 100 kg;;
Or more;;
Lmao;;
<@207416847019016202> maybe you can help me with a problem. The building I work at has WiFi that blocks so many sites, can‚Äôt use spotify, discord, twitch even some of the sites I actually need for work. Is there a way to get around that? Like if I bought a separate router and hard wired in to it, can I bypass their security for this crap? It‚Äôs really annoying me;;
dude im very bad a that but id say no you cant <@416803598173995018> ;;
internet from provider goes into your building to some router, and from that - to all those wifi spots in the building;;
" people who has access to that router, can set up rules like ""dont go on that site"" and stuff.";;
so if you just use internet from that router, no matter how, wifi or cable, you got some sites blocked;;
thats very dumb way how i understand that, but i think its correct;;
"when you say ""separate router"" what do you exactly mean? you still want to connect it to something";;
Oh damnit;;
Like I could buy my own router cause there are Ethernet plugs in my office. Didn‚Äôt know if that would help at all;;
i think traffic blocked before those ethrnet plugs;;
I‚Äôm gonna see if my company can just get our own WiFi here. The WiFi signal is bad regardless and the building won‚Äôt fix it so maybe we can just get our own;;
Oh ok;;
Thanks for the help;;
but im really bad in that, i just know basics;;
Yeah I know nothing lol. Thought maybe you did;;
Stupid work WiFi lol. Blocking me from doing stuff that takes away from my job! Those bastards;;
They are most likely blocking things at the edge of the network or the edge of your network access;;
cant you just use your 4G from phone? <@416803598173995018>;;
or is it too expensive?;;
Service in the building is awful;;
Otherwise I would;;
oh ok;;
got you;;
i worked in such buildings;;
but it can depend on cell operator;;
sometimes it worth to change one;;
Yeah I‚Äôm hoping we can get our own WiFi in here cause it actually stops me from being able to do my job sometimes so;;
<@409836692158021632> I have played mk11 today, It has my vote for goty;;
When you hide your kids, you HAVE to check it out!! It is sooooo gooood;;
https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/bgi71y/psa_to_anyone_buying_mk11_the_harder_towers_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app;;
Hate to burst your bubble <@!498246547838992414>;;
Seems a bit fucked they are doing that;;
i just watched couple russian reviews, and all of them theres really a lot of grind;;
which you can replace with monetisation;;
but fuck, something want me to try it;;
even though i never played MK, or, any fightings at all;;
and its not even full price here on steam;;
but as i understand micros dont stand in the way of finishing the story;;
I really hate how games have become like this. Pay money for dlc, pay money to level up etc. it‚Äôs bullshit;;
That‚Äôs good, at least you can do story <@207416847019016202>;;
<@416803598173995018> yeah, I saw that, but from what I know, the grind is completely optional;;
The story is fenominal tho;;
Game looked awesome though watching your stream <@!498246547838992414>;;
Oh grind is optional. Ok that‚Äôs good;;
Because it is awesome <@416803598173995018>, just I also don't like the grind, so I'm not gonna do it, you unlock plenty during the story already;;
yeah but i know nothing about the MK universe and characters. usually i would start from first game, but i dont feel this way about fightings;;
Cassie cage;;
Damn;;
Yeah it looked awesome;;
<@207416847019016202> if you're interested, play 9 and X;;
The rebooted timeline;;
hm;;
mk 9 isnt on steam?;;
9's story is probably one of the best fighting game stories out there, in my opinion;;
i would play it but i dont see it on steam;;
No? <@207416847019016202> I got it on steam;;
hm;;
can you give me link?;;
It's called Mortal Kombat Komplete edition;;
oh ok i saw that;;
Yeah, it's that;;
6,58 bucks for me;;
Then is Mortal Kombat X, which also had a great story btw, just a weak villain;;
so its kinda one story through 9 10 and 11?;;
Yes, because Neatherrealm rebooted the franchise with mk9;;
cool, thanks, ill try 9 then;;
Cool, It's really good;;
i remember my brother playing it on xbox360, but i wasnt interested;;
he beat it i think;;
<@207416847019016202> the final boss is hard af;;
Because I suck, but beside that, it was still difficult;;
i suck more thats for sure;;
in all my 25+ years of gaming only fighting i played was some not well known fightg i can even remember name...;;
Well, I've basically only played MK, so I don't have a huge history in fighting games;;
remembered it, Last Bronx;;
Never heard of it <@207416847019016202>;;
<@!498246547838992414> ;;
I'll have to find a way to check out MK11;;
My co-worker is so hyped about it right now that he's gonna start competing again;;
that's like the best selling point I've heard yet;;
yeah it not well known, i just had disk in my childhood;;
<@409836692158021632>, Give another meaning to *hide yo kids*;;
Was it good? <@207416847019016202>;;
hahaha <@!498246547838992414>;;
i dont know how to measure fightings;;
we played co-op on one keyboard;;
who do you main <@!498246547838992414> ?;;
In MK11, right now Noob Saibot & Shao Kahn <@409836692158021632>;;
Shao Kahnnnnnnnn;;
Yeeeeess;;
It was worth the pre-order to get him;;
by the way, i couldnt come up with anything what i want to stream after Anne, and after a lot of thoughts i realised that i want to play first Banner saga (and if this will be alright, 2 and 3 too).;;
but it wasnt long before i realised that theres one more game i want to play - We. The Revolution ;;
So i want your opinion guys on which of these two games could be interesting to you (look it up if you didnt hear about them);;
this message is mostly for <@416803598173995018> and <@557380058566623233> because they were interested in what i will stream;;
Oh let me see I know Banner saga that be cool but let me check the other one because I don‚Äôt know it <@207416847019016202>;;
<@207416847019016202> ;;
We the Revolution looks good!;;
<@207416847019016202> I just watch regardless;;
Wow it looks really interesting. Never heard of it before. I vote for that if you don‚Äôt mind. <@207416847019016202>;;
We the revolution;;
yeah, i heard karak and rej talking about it on podcast;;
very interesting concept;;
but banner saga story is awesome too;;
so i think we will start from revolution;;
by the way, i just did first battle in MK9 <@!498246547838992414>;;
Ooh!! <@207416847019016202>;;
Are you enjoying it?;;
so far i like the story;;
had two fights;;
as i understand its total reboot of the story;;
It is, it's a whole lot of lore  <@207416847019016202>;;
How did the fights go?;;
2-1 with reptile, 2-1 with baraka;;
but baraka has some other name;;
guy with teeth;;
Tarkatans;;
and i lost first fight with him;;
i cant understand what should i do with that charge i gain;;
i tried to press LT+RT, it just waste charge but nothing happens;;
It's a special move that does a lot of damage, you need to time it right so the guy doesn't block or dodge it;;
but is it LT+RT?;;
I think so;;
because when i press it i see how cage kinda charge himself, and nothing happens;;
he doesnt try to attack or something;;
I don't know his attacks very well, but he can charge himself so he takes less damage I think;;
But there is this special move chatacters can do called x-rays;;
They fo heaps of damage;;
Do*;;
so maybe its not LT+RT;;
ill try to find it in menu;;
Yeah, maybe the best;;
I don't know it off the top of my head;;
ok, it says LT+RT and its counter attack;;
got it, will try that;;
Okay, good;;
lol no luck yet;;
each time i try that, he just does some aggro move, kinda teasing opponent;;
ok did it;;
Cool, destroy him!!;;
wow <@207416847019016202> is playing a fighting game!;;
I ‚ù§ it!!!;;
yeah <@409836692158021632>;;
to my surprise, love it so far;;
well i cant say i enjoy fighting process, but story is good for now;;
especially the fact that its from very beginning;;
Fatality of Hate!!! <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
no fatalities so far for stupid orange;;
you'll get it eventually;;
"or you can just yell ""fok off dude"" and their heads will explode! ";;
üòÇ;;
hm good idea;;
who need all those combos when you are orange;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
just beat 2 girls (jena and kitana) - it really felt like physical activity;;
nice, Orange!;;
yeah, we will do it russian way - beating as much girls as possible;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
<@207416847019016202> tough, they both look good;;
think we the revolution gets my vote;;
yeah, we'll start with it;;
i think its shorter;;
very cool, it looks interesting. Are you playing mortal kombat?;;
How do you get it to say what games you are playing under your name on right side of screen?;;
its in discord settings;;
yes im playing MK9 now;;
chapter 4;;
user settings -> game activity <@416803598173995018>;;
How you like it? Also thanks for that info <@207416847019016202>;;
I love story so far. Not sure if I'm really enjoy gameplay, because this necessity to beat next enemy no matter how hard he is, kinda stress me out  <@416803598173995018>;;
Let's say I wait for the next enemy not with anticipation but more with annoyment;;
Especially when it's two enemies at the same time;;
Good morning!;;
Morning <@557380058566623233>;;
Hello <@!498246547838992414>;;
I see you are enjoying MK11;;
morning <@557380058566623233> <@!498246547838992414>;;
Morning <@207416847019016202>;;
<@207416847019016202> the story i great. Id be bad at fighting games now lol. I was horrible before and I havent played one in years so I will just watch Crims play it;;
Morning <@!498246547838992414> and <@557380058566623233>;;
Morning <@416803598173995018>;;
How are you today?;;
yeah i suck at fightings as i suck at all games <@416803598173995018> ;;
but story more important than gameplay;;
yeah I am awful at fighting games lol. I have always been but I always like the story behind mortal kombat. Even the movies from the 90's were so bad but I liked them still;;
I am good. Woke up with a friking headache though <@416803598173995018> you?;;
I hate when that happens, usually its cause I am dehydrated but its so annoying to wake up that way. Not too bad, got to work about 45 minutes ago, just doing the daily financials and answering emails now;;
Just a couple of days and you be out on your honeymoon that will be cool;;
i watched first mortal kombat movie in... 1996 i think;;
it was cool for the time;;
but i didnt watch it after;;
or it was 95 even;;
yeah there were two I believe in the 90's. I havent seen them in awhile, im sure they are not as good as we remember lol;;
<@557380058566623233> honeymoon isnt until june actually lol. We are doing a legal ceremony here with just our parents attending and then in june, we are doing another ceremony in France with everyone and go on honeymoon after;;
i actually had second on vhs. but im not sure if i watched that entirely;;
Oh I see <@416803598173995018> still you must be pretty excited about it;;
Might be worth watching again then <@207416847019016202>;;
yeah its pretty crazy lol <@557380058566623233>;;
I never thought Id get married;;
no im pretty sure second not worth of watching;;
first one i would, but i dont like to watch anything alone (because i prefer to spend that time on games or on coding), and mrs orange would not enjoy such a movie;;
lol yeah and honestly, if I remember correctly the cgi if you wanna call it that, was not good;;
I also very rarely watch movies alone;;
im very tolerate towards old graphics;;
so maybe it would be okay for me;;
i hate more when people choose to use some weird cheap art style nowadays;;
What do you mean?;;
Fucking hate spring;;
i mean any low detailed pixel art game <@416803598173995018>;;
dont get me wrong, i have nothing against pixel art in general, but sometimes its too primitive;;
ahhh ok, I know what you mean now;;
<@!417075583692963840> why you hate spring?;;
Its rains too fucking much;;
Where are you located?;;
America;;
Same. Doesn‚Äôt rain at all where I‚Äôm at in California lol;;
Grew up in Boston, different story there lol;;
Its was fucking storming and shit last night;;
Love thunderstorms. Miss them cause they hardly ever happen here;;
I would say there's not a lot of rains here too;;
By the way I'll stream end of Anne today <@557380058566623233>;;

awesome;;
I want to check it out;;
i love good stories;;
end had two option, sane one and empathic one. everybody chose empathic one;;
i will not do more spoilers though;;
I knew you were thinking that when we all choose second option <@207416847019016202> lol;;
i wasnt only thinking, i said that several times;;
hahhaha;;
I know is a manner of speaking;;
orange doesnt undesrtand English figures of speech;;
Orange is a good streamer he pleases his audience lol;;
orange understand more than <@488734758847905803>  because he has rare ability to read 2 sentences in correct order;;
Lmao;;
üòÇ;;
lmao;;
It's not my fault!;;
when I have a bigger monitor it'll be easier;;
Excuses excuses;;
Lol;;
üò≠;;
i read it correct off the phone so size doesnt matter;;
it matters for womango though;;
Lol;;
besides;;
damn... üî• üî•;;
now it's part of my charm;;
what does mango do the best?;;
he reads messages out of order;;

are you planning on finishing sekiro on stream <@488734758847905803> ?;;
yep;;
hopefully wll manage to do it before i travel;;
but I am starting to think that it won't be possible;;
*respect ++*;;
haha;;
why not?;;
you can do it man;;
before the trip;;
cause it's next friday;;
ohh;;
but I will def finish it on stream;;

i am super stressing on some stuff these last few days;;
stressing on what;;
trip is coming up;;
my editor asked to get a more refined version by wednesday (and I have a short trip with some friends on friday so i can't work the weekend);;
and I have a fever;;
and I have to decide on some PC parts that I had to end up having to change;;
and I have to decide quickly;;
AND;;
I'm hungry;;
you got this man, focus on priorities first;;
getting the work done;;
yeah, it's hard sometimes to look at each thing separately for me;;
but I do have to;;
Focus on the hungry part. Foooooddd;;

Hey <@488734758847905803> and <@207416847019016202>;;

yo yourself <@488734758847905803>;;
Thats good <@207416847019016202> I wish I could not have bad days lol. Whats going on? <@488734758847905803>;;
its all in your head lol <@416803598173995018>;;
Agreed, just tough to not let stuff get to you sometimes I guess lol. It is for me at least;;
what's on the agenda today <@207416847019016202> ?;;
who goes to the gulag?;;
yeah I agree <@416803598173995018>;;
I'vebeen stressing quite a bit with the trip;;
you go to gulag mango;;
everybody will go to gulag someday <@488734758847905803> ;;
i will announce your schedule little later;;
lmao;;
I might take a rain check;;
I'll l et <@416803598173995018> go in my stead;;
he will have his own time;;
im too pretty for prison;;
I wouldnt survive;;
why? you would be beauty queen there;;
exactly;;
i mean;;
you would survive;;
just not in a healthy way;;
Yeah and my butt would be the daily dessert too;;
exactly lol;;
lmao;;
though I think that kind of thing is an American phenomenon;;
south and north;;
i'm not sure that happens a lot in europe;;
Ahh ok, never been to prison in Europe so I wasnt sure;;
lmao me neither;;
but I've heard that guards there dont just allow the inmates do wreak havoc;;
My buddy is a prison guard in Massachusetts. Would never, ever fucking want that job;;
He makes like $110,000 a year and it wouldn't matter, still dont want it;;
You americans make too much <@416803598173995018>;;
What;;
Yeah what?;;
lol;;
100k for a prison guard;;
Maybe the 1% does but not the rest of us;;
But compared to Belgium, 110K is crazy;;
For any job;;
110k isn't that much but a prison guard;;
<@!417075583692963840> thats not his base salary, he does tons of overtime and thats how he gets it;;
Oh that makes sense;;
I dunno how economy, cost of living etc is in Belgium to compare <@!498246547838992414>;;
Yeah <@!417075583692963840> he works a fuck ton to make that much lol;;
<@416803598173995018> I looked it up, minimum wage here is about ‚Ç¨19000;;
110K is insane to me;;
$15,000 here;;
But there is a currency difference;;
Thats about what I was making 2 years ago;;
Yeah isnt the Euro worth more? lol;;
Yes, the ‚Ç¨ is more;;
But 19K a year;;
And houses here cost way too much;;
So, frick Belgium;;
I'm moving to Ireland;;
Ireland isnt cheap either lol. I looked up real estate not that long ago there and it was going up;;
Houses here are insane;;
Dang;;
The netherlands it is;;
I found a 1 bedroom house last month by my apartment and it was 1.2 million;;
WHAT <@416803598173995018>;;
YUP;;
Jeeeez;;
California real estate in certain areas is insane;;
My friend lived in San Fransisco, in the worst area of the city. Tiny studio apartment and she was paying $3000 a month for it;;
Gun shots every night;;
I'm never moving to america, never wanted to either;;
<@416803598173995018> that is totally insane dude;;
Yeah, just another reason I hate California. I love it cause its beautiful, nice weather, loads to do but living costs are insane;;
Yeah dude, dont move here lol. If rent doesnt get you, medical costs will;;
Im still paying off my knee surgery from over 2 years ago;;
Jeez;;
Im trying to move to Germany in the next 2 years;;
"We get a part of the surgery refunded or paid for by the ""ziekenkas""";;
It's kinda like obamacare;;
Thats cool. I really hope Bernie Sanders or Kamala Harris wins the presidency next year. They both want to change how this country runs. Get universal healthcare, take power away from major banks etc;;
Healthcare here is atrocious;;
Days gone is not getting good reviews from what I've read so far;;
i dont think its only US phenomenon (if we speak about buttfucking in prison);;
<@488734758847905803> ;;
"as i said before, in russia idea of prison is not like ""different gangs"", its more like about old family-like criminal traditions (as in sick families, you would know)";;
so, i mean, inside prison theres all about criminal prison laws;;
"and criminal authorities there pick up who will be lets say their sluts, and those people are called ""lowered"", or ""roosters"". thats why calling someone rooster in russia is very offensive for some people, especially for those who respect criminal laws";;
and when i say criminal laws i mean prison laws made up by criminals;;
Hmm that‚Äôs an interesting difference <@207416847019016202>;;
Mango would be a prison slut;;
Damn;;
Hells naw;;
I'd make friends with everyone there;;
They'd be likr;;
Yo, here comes mango, what up?;;
How are you doing my guy?;;
Sleep well?;;
You tell me if you're not eating right;;
And then I'd leave to do prison stuff and they'd be like;;
What a nice guy;;
Nah you‚Äôd be a slut;;
You gotta beat up the biggest guy on the first day so everyone will be scared of you;;
what if you get beat up instead?;;
people say that like its an option to take on the biggest guy;;
you'd just get destroyed;;
But what if you have one of them batons? <@278571432588345345>;;
Just beat them with that;;
you dont though;;
youre just a dude in prison;;
Grab a chair;;
Oh;;
Are there chairs in prison?;;
idk, never been;;
well me neither right lol;;
but no, they have benches fixed to the ground;;
nothing that can be used as a weapon in general;;
dang;;
Just have a street fighter like fight in prison lol;;
Would be cool;;
but you dont though hahaha;;
I see myself as a Tyrion;;
not good at fights;;
but I can talk my way out of almost anything;;
Mango is a dwarf confirmed;;
I don't know who he is but I guess he is a prison slut;;
have literally been close to death about 3 times where I talked my way out of a situation;;
lmao;;
tyrion from game of thrones <@207416847019016202>;;
I guessed so;;
I talked my way out of a situation where some guy was being an ass to me, so I decided to be an even bigger ass back to him, he eventually got a teacher because he's a little bitch, so I used some phoenix wright court skills, and the other guy got in trouble;;
Eventhough I was the waaayy bigger bastard;;
Omg I hate little bitches;;
I do too;;
That's why i hate  <@488734758847905803>;;
Hahaha;;
Yes;;
lolz;;
Lmao <@207416847019016202> ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who he is but I guess he is a prison slut‚Äù hahaha;;
Well mango said they are alike;;
So I suggested;;
who doesn't know who tyrion is;;
now I distrust you even more <@207416847019016202>;;
not human confirmed;;
I'm sure people in the congo take a break from killing eachother to watch game of thrones;;
lmfao <@278571432588345345>;;
hahahaah;;
omg;;
what a great sentence;;
Makes sense <@207416847019016202>;;
<@278571432588345345> yeah we established the orange is KGB robot awhile ago;;
adds up;;
Well I hope people in lingo love game of thrones;;
In kongo;;
"dude getting chased by lion in serengetti - ""woah dude stahp its GoT time""";;
my bad says the lion;;
Lmao;;

everyone does <@207416847019016202>;;
you're just missing out and wrong;;
lmao;;
yeah I agree;;
Orange is wrong;;
just plain wrong;;
Lol I don't care about that shit;;
and you're wrong;;
lol;;
I generallt don't watch no  comedic shows;;
Don't have patience and time for them;;
how dafaq is that a comedy;;
I said I don't watch NON comedic;;
ohh;;
I prefer to spend that time on sitcoms, coding and games;;
Is <@207416847019016202> right or wrong?;;
;;
[] Right [X] Wrong;;
lol jk;;
not everything is for everyone;;
no;;
this is;;
There‚Äôs funny moments in game of thrones lol;;
and <@207416847019016202> is wrong;;
I know lots of people that don‚Äôt want it;;
by lots you mean like literally 2 people or something?;;
lol;;
My dad is coming this weekend and we are gonna watch Sunday‚Äôs episode lol. He said he wants to get into the show, he picked the worst episode to starts on;;
"It's the end of the month and  <@278571432588345345> had few ""Orange you're wrong"" left. It would be shame to loose them (Orange hate data plan refreshes every month) , so jonny decided to spend it all at once";;
Nevertheless, i don't care about shows;;
lmao;;
"I have the ""all you can hate"" orange plan";;
They piss off me a lot, but unlike sitcoms, they don't have hilarious humor which I like;;
Only show you care about is how I met your mother;;
No;;
But that's favourite;;
I love most of sitcoms;;
By shows right now I mean non comedic;;
Ahhh ok;;
Have you watched more Brooklyn 99?;;
That should have been clear since I mentioned it;;
To be honest I didn't watch anything since Dubai. So we stopped on 4th season of Brooklyn;;
I don't  watch anything by myself, so we watch anything only if me and Mrs Orange want to;;
ahh ok, I have seen them all except the new season. Think I have only seen 2 episodes from the new one;;
We stuck at last episode of season 4;;
Nice. Its a good show I think;;
yeah it's great;;
I love Andy samberg;;
lol yeah me too;;
https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hundreds-of-ps4-games-and-dlc-are-discounted-for-p/1100-6466412/ @everyone ps4 has some good deals right now;;

What kind of deals? 3 into 1?;;
Sorry I meant 3 for 1;;

It's not up to me, it's all about how much queen will handle;;

Okay, tell us about that time you gave an autograph <@488734758847905803>;;
I had just arrived in Brazil. And I looked exactly like Harry Potter (according to some sources);;
so, I was talking in english with my mom;;
at the mall;;
When u sign a check <@488734758847905803> it is not an autograph;;
and this little girl is like pointing at me;;
and telling her dad;;
it's harry potter;;
hahaha <@537319907541516311>;;
so he asked me to sign an autograph for her, even though my mom said I wasnt him;;
lmaoooooo;;
this was 14 years ago;;
so you can imagine this little girl today;;
omg...that poor girl...she was probably legally blind...;;
I swear, it was harry potter. he even signed an autograph. he was talking  in english;;
Poor little girl. Decieved;;

"gonna start calling you ""Harry Knobler"" from now on <@488734758847905803>";;
I dont even know who manny is, but that was a hilarious joke;;
I swear you and <@537319907541516311> should do stand up;;
hahahahah;;
Manny Pacquiao is a famous Filipino boxer;;
harry knobler lmao;;
<@537319907541516311> would crush stand up for sure;;
people would just think I'm there to park cars at the comedy club;;
Hahahaha omg <@409836692158021632> that story was hilarious. I was just laughing so hard walking to my car;;
it's a true story <@416803598173995018> ;;
"I was already shaving my head then and I just stared at the homeless guy like ""WAT?""";;
I'm not a midget filipino boxer, dude...;;
hahahaha;;
I;m not kidding <@409836692158021632> you come up with shit faster than when I eat dairy;

the comedic duo, marklar and daughter;;

hahaha;;
NO ONE CARES!;;

I still never got a win after that apex game man;;
You were my first and only;;
but that was a very memorable Apex win though;;
sad that Apex numbers are in decline;;
but that's a great memory we will always share...;;
the numbers are declining?;;
guess people got sick of it for some reason?;;
yeah it will;;
my first and only battle royale with cheese victory;;
Apex is stagnating at the moment;;
not enough new content to keep people interested;;
and they messed up imo by paying Ninja and the other big streamers to play it when it came out;;
now those same big name streamers are no longer playing Apex because there's nothing new;;
it's hard to compete in the BR genre when you have Fortnite pumping out something new every week or so;;
TRUE;;
very true;;
gonna go back to writing my dude;;
will be back later;;
I have to close discord otherwise I get distracted as FUCK;;
later <@488734758847905803>;;
peace out brother love;;

If you would get me 2 visas  I would already be buying tickets to LA  <@409836692158021632>;;
I will try my best comrade <@207416847019016202>;;
Agreed <@409836692158021632> I posted a link on twitter that perfectly sums up the state of apex right now;;
but your passports would have new names probably;;
"you would be ""Mr. Bob Orange"" <:Orange:545555843978887170>";;
Short version of my name sounds in russian like Vova, which is kinda sounds similar to Bob, so bob is basically translation of my name;;
it was that youtube link, right <@416803598173995018> ?;;
I'll check it out;;
<@409836692158021632> yaya;;
Lol. You guys don't undersell yourselves. You make that Twitch chat god damn hilarious!;;
hahaha nice one <@207416847019016202>;;
your channel is a learning channel <@537319907541516311> ;;

Hahahaha;;
Bobby Orange singing the country hits!;;
"First Single...""Y'all Fok Off Now, Ya Hear?""";;
lol I‚Äôd listen to it;;
I would too! and watch him transition from country music to pop just like T-Swift;;
Found your new career <@207416847019016202> and <@409836692158021632> will be your agent;;
Fuck you  <@409836692158021632>;;
Off to a great start!;;
hahaha;;
"I get .0000015% every time Orange says ""Fok U""";;
Kicking me in painful spots;;
Fuck you Mark is the perfect first single name;;
haha;;
Fok you Mark will be in the credits;;
Bobby O's first single will probably be about his hate for Mango;;
All of his songs will be about that;;
hahaha;;
Possible song titles;;
Mango...Toxic Streamer;;
All songs will be about Taylor swift transition to pop;;
Read chat properly;;
Mango...stop yelling;;
Prison slut;;
This is Orange discord now;;

<@207416847019016202>  - The herpes hero;;

"Herpes Hero featuring special collaboration with MC SkyDaze""";;
I might be a hero, but you're person who saved us all from it by keeping it in your body  <@537319907541516311>;;

hahahaha;;
Brilliant song names <@409836692158021632>;;
hahaha ;;
thanks, ChangeOvahhh;;
I've learned a lot from SkyRage's channel;;
Hahaha;;
I will do it on Twitch karaoke;;
You spelled his name wrong. Full name is SkyRageSP, which means sky rage soft porn;;
who will be my partner?;;
yessss;;
Twitch Sings will be awesome for ya <@537319907541516311>;;
SkyRage Slutty Protest;;
oh my gawd;;
SP = soft porn!!!;;
you win the internet <@207416847019016202>;;
It was right there all the time  <@409836692158021632>;;
<@409836692158021632> it stands for slurping porn;;
I know hahaha;;
I couldn't see it;;
that's why you control the gulag, Orange!;;
slurping p.....;;
That's why i am  the gulag;;
Speaking of gulag, I want some ghoulash;;
hahaha ;;
"<:Orange:545555843978887170> ""I am the gulag""";;
Lmao;;
is ghoulash a thing in UK? <@537319907541516311>;;
I‚Äôve had goulash here before;;
is shaurma/shawerma a thing there ? <@416803598173995018>;;
lets say its arab street food;;
also can be called doner and 999 other names;;
we have shawarma here <@207416847019016202>;;
oh good;;
thought so;;
it was in brooklyn 99 also;;
hahaha NINE NINE!;;
Yeah it‚Äôs huge here <@207416847019016202>;;
Glendale has got some of the best in the area. I‚Äôm sure <@409836692158021632> can attest to that;;
here i would say, we got 2 kinds of shawarma (by the way, in moscow everyone calls it shaurma, and in saint petersburg - shawerma);;
1. dirty street food;;
2. overpriced in some restaurants;;
first one is not always 100% safe i would say, and not always 100% fresh, but sometimes pretty good;;
2nd is just restaurants trying to mimic it, fucked up half of ingridients and so on;;
<@416803598173995018> haha;;
Glen-DAYLE;;
what is glendayle?;;
Lmao I think only me and mark will get that. It‚Äôs a city in California;;
i thought its food chain;;
No just an area with lots of middle eastern people so there‚Äôs lots of schwarma places;;
I don‚Äôt know of any good chain place as for that type of food here;;
yeah here too;;
i mean here is no chains with shawarma;;
also middle eastern type i would say;;
but its soviet midlle eastern;;
I didn‚Äôt know there was such a thing before I met my friend. Soviet middle eastern I mean. She was born in Israel but she says she Russian because she lived in Russia almost half her life;;
what i mean is countries like Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kirgizstan, Moldovia;;
they are all ex soviet, and their migrants are main cheap work force in russia;;
in big cities at least;;
Ahhh ok that makes sense;;
ubzbekistan people here is like mexicans in us;;
so i said soviet middle eastern because i think its exactly same vibe, like when you but shawarma here and in US, but those nationalilties are very different;;
I understand now;;
Yeah it‚Äôs the same vibe;;
also when you buy shawarma in turkey and dubai - same vibe;;
but what i hated there - in turkey and especially in dubai (where eat on the street kinda forbidden), all those shawarma (and other food) places are not like street food when you can just go to person, buy it and go eat it, but its usually cafes, with tables, menus, and stuff;;
and i its not easy for me to get used, because in moscow its just little places where youre not suppose to sit or wait for waiter;;
Do they have regulations agains that there? Here in LA the street places are huge. Like you said, just go up, order and get your food and leave;;
in dubai - 100% they have, because as i said, to eat on the street is forbidden;;
well nobody will arrest you if you will do it;;
Ahh ok. I wonder why. Maybe to keep the city clean?;;
but i was there 10 days and i can say - nobody does it;;
maybe to keep it clean, but i think it is one of those stupid rules which had sense a long time ago, like, you know, so people would not get deceases and stuff, but after that just became stupid old religious rule, that everybody follow just because they are religious;;
like not eating pork - im sure it originally had some health reasons;;
"but now its just stupid muslim rule, also like ""not eat on street""";;
Ahhh ok. Yeah that makes sense. It‚Äôs still technically illegal to spit in public in Massachusetts because of when they had tuberculosis outbreaks. You‚Äôd never get in trouble for it now but it‚Äôs still technically a law;;
but with turkey, i think its not because of rules, its just the way it is. Even if you compare moscow and saint petersburg, in SP a loot more shawarma places have tables and such;;
Hmm that‚Äôs interesting I guess to see how each place is different;;
I didn‚Äôt see any places you just walk up to in paris now that I think of it. Here, they are everywhere;;
yeah, as i said, even moscow and SP have huge differences in that regard;;
Yeah I guess that‚Äôs true wherever you go. It‚Äôs different in most places;;
Damn, now I want schwarma lol;;
do you eat it generally?;;
i mean, does diet allows it?;;
Once in awhile, yeah;;
Yeah just not the bread;;
I usually eat the meat and vegetables;;
yeah im sure you eat meat, but you know, all that street food got random ingridients, random amount of salt and stuff... <@416803598173995018>;;
Haha yeah sometimes you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in it I guess;;
i thought maybe diet forbid some products;;
like, at all;;
Just sugar and carbs really;;
I need high fat, protein and a good amount of salt with this diet;;
Lots of vegetables too but only certain ones that aren‚Äôt high carb;;
oh okay, so salt is your target, not thing you avoid;;
Get yourself some chicken salt <@416803598173995018> So goooood!;;
<@207416847019016202> you can get ghoulash here, but it is not British, so we want to deport it back to where it came from;;
Yeah cause salt has potassium in it and I don‚Äôt get a lot of that with the diet I‚Äôm on. Never heard of chicken salt <@537319907541516311> but I‚Äôll look it up;;
Dude it is the bomb! Chicken flavoured salt goes with anything.;;
is it you who didnt eat KFC in 15 years? <@416803598173995018>;;
Bananas are a good source of potassium too and plantains;;
In England KFC has very high standards and quality. It is so good here.;;
Oh sweet <@537319907541516311> I‚Äôll see if I can get some. Yeah it‚Äôs been about 15 years or so since I‚Äôve had kfc <@207416847019016202>;;
It‚Äôs shit here lol;;
Why so long <@416803598173995018> ?;;
Oh I see. You lot like Popeyes right?;;
Can‚Äôt have bananas, too high in carbs;;
Nope never had Popeyes;;
Roscoes?;;
I don‚Äôt eat fast food really;;
Never heard of roscoes lol;;
U never have a cheeky dominos then?;;
wait? really <@416803598173995018> ?;;
Roscoe's chicken and waffles?;;
Aye I‚Äôve had dominos a few times;;
Yeah <@409836692158021632> we don't have Roscoes here, but I hear its good;;
Oh maybe I have heard of that <@409836692158021632> but never had it;;
haha ok;;
It‚Äôs in LA right?;;
<@409836692158021632> If I come to America can you make Mechadong Baka?;;
there's a bunch of em;;
Pico, Hollywood, South LA, Pasadena;;
haha <@537319907541516311> ;;
watchu know about Mechadong Baka, mate?;;
Dude I love it!;;
In the winter it is great!;;
If you visit here I will take you to the best Filipino/Pinoy spots;;
Ahh ok. Yeah I know the place then but never been;;
It warms my soul;;
<@409836692158021632> for sure!;;
and all the US pop tarts you can fit in your pockets!;;
And all the diabetes you can take with you!;;
Indeed! Currently have 4 boxed at home. Not enough;;
hahaha true <@416803598173995018>;;
Yes. I hear diabetes is popular in America;;
Sadly yes lol;;
It is now a recognised sport;;
Everything is loaded with sugar and preservatives;;
Hahaha;;
ironically;;
I don't know how your FDA allows all that weird shit in your foods. So glad u guys are educated about it;;
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had Filipino food before now that I think about it;;
Who knows man. Food here is fucked a lot of the time;;
Filipino food is all about hearty, and wholsome meals. No pretentious shit;;
Couldn‚Äôt believe the difference in quality when I went to France;;
Nice. I‚Äôll have to try some. <@409836692158021632> when can I come for dinner?;;
<@416803598173995018> did u see the ingredients list I posted on Twitter for UK pop tarts vs American ones?;;
<@416803598173995018>  you dont need to ask, just go to <@409836692158021632>  home;;
Lol yeah I commented on it I thought. Maybe not <@537319907541516311>;;
True <@207416847019016202>;;

Lol;;
;;
There I pinned it so everyone can see haha;;
I have a friend who became a cop;;
and I saw him when he was on a call;;
he responded to a couple having an argument outside of a blockbuster;;
I saw him and he was trying really hard not to crack up when he saw me and tried to stay professional with the couple üòÇ;;
Lol that‚Äôs funny. Yeah since my friends lived in Boston, they would stop by when I worked just to mess with me etc;;
Good job on his part staying professional lol. Maybe you weren‚Äôt as bad as my friends were;;
I tried to tone it down;;
"but I was mouthing the words to him ""what the fok dude...""";;
"and he just waved me off like ""nothing to see here sir...keep it moving"" üòÇ";;
Lol my friends would yell ‚Äúarrest me officer, I‚Äôve been naughty!‚Äù And stuff like that hahaha;;
Keep it moving lmao;;
oh wow;;
haha...your friends are jerks!;;
that's awesome tho;;
Lol yeah and I laughed every time too. I can‚Äôt keep a straight face with stuff like that;;
Lol yeah it was funny at least. They never did it during anything serious at least;;
haha that's good;;
I think my phone charger is broken. Since I‚Äôve plugged it in, my battery has gone down lol;;

Nah jk, I bought mine ready made;;
hey all. ive been a bit MIA lately;;
Not more than one tube  <@488734758847905803>. But I don't know brands;;
Hey  <@442488674144223242> how are you dude;;
good man. watching the footy at the moment;;
Who's playing?;;
Melburn city?;;
Today Taylor Swift released new song with Brendon Urie from Panic at the disco <@409836692158021632>;;
I'm pretty sure nothing can happen today that can top it <@416803598173995018>;;
;;
Morning fellas üêº;;
Australian footy <@207416847019016202>   Port Adelaide v North Melbourne;;
Morning  <@455797717763883009>;;
Hm I checked my football app but I don't see those names  <@442488674144223242>;;
I see only Russian names;;
And logos;;
morning guys!;;
yo <@455797717763883009>;;
let's git dat bread;;
"quick story before I go back to wokr cause my ""boss"" fucked me over";;
"She comes to me the other day and asks, ""Can you do 7k words if we deliver the file to you at 9:30pm? We need it by 1pm the next day.""";;
;;
"And I was like, ""Sure, if you add 25% to the rate, because I am going to have to work afterhours.""";;
;;
"And she was like, ""Oh, are you sure? bl abla bla""";;
"Then she asked, ""How much could you do if it's only in the morning?""";;
"I said, ""5k words""";;
Ok she answered.;;
;;
"So, last night, she was like, ""Oh, I have the file now, but I'll send it to you in the morning since you're not going to work on it now, right?""";;
"And I said to myself, ""Dude. I could have gotten a head start on it last night.""";;
"but I had to say, ""Yeah, sure. send it to me in the morning""";;
such pettiness!;;
I hope she gets something in her teeth all day and can't get it out;;
Hahahahaha <@488734758847905803> that sucks! People is so stupid most of the time;;
Good morning all!;;
right? haha;;
Probably I'm stupid too. Let me read it again and maybe I'll get it;;
if you dont understand something specifically, i'll explain better;;
Oh I got it;;
She fucked you;;
I think you could say that you will work at night. Because price of your overwork either 25%, or less words;;
You chose less words but you still can do it at night;;
but she didnt want to pay the 25%;;
so she tried to go around that feee;;
yeah but youre right;;
I should have said that if it were less words, I could do it at night;;
I believe in You, next time you will be smarter;;
now I have russian life coach;;
Sounds lethal;;
good;;
Russian life coach = less life, more hate;;
I feel the rage pumping through me;;
<@207416847019016202> my wedding today will top that;;
oh yeah!;;
that's awesome <@416803598173995018> !!;;
Nice <@455797717763883009> let us know how it is;;
<@488734758847905803> yeah except for the fact that I threw out the left side of my neck just now waking up lol. Gotta get that fixed. I called off work because of it;;
So I‚Äôm going back to bed after taking some muscle relaxers lol;;
Good job <@!416803598173995018>, your dongle just grew to 31!;;

Nice dongle!;;
Not for me lol  <@416803598173995018>;;
Yeah man lol. Muscle relaxers knock me out so hopefully I will feel better when I wake back up;;
But that was exactly what I meant when I mentioned you;;

Thanks man! So crazy;;
I can imagine;;
Wait no, I can't;;
Some day man. I always said I‚Äôd never get married lol;;
<@416803598173995018> Congrats, man!;;
Happy Friday, everyone!;;
Thanks <@409836692158021632> !! Happy Friday to you too;;
Hey <@409836692158021632> happy Friday;;
you too <@557380058566623233>;;
So <@409836692158021632>  now that you are done with Sekiro what are you playing?;;
haha;;
<@557380058566623233> I'm still playing Sekiro;;
I'm grinding skill points to purchase all the skills in the 5 skill trees;;
Then I'll start my 2nd playthrough.;;
I got locked out of an area because of the path I took in the 1st playthrough so I want to unlock that chunk I missed.;;
Then play it again some more to get all the endings. üòÇ;;
Good lord you guys must be masochistic! I hope to finish it once <@409836692158021632>;;
I guess it should be easier the other play through;;
I was really upset that I missed a big part of the story because it has all these branching story paths.;;
I'm playing again to mostly get that part. <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
I saw the credits roll on Octopath but the real ending boss is after credits so I need to do that;;
what? the real end boss is AFTER the credits?;;
that's pretty amazing!;;
Yeah one of those. So after 120 hours of game I still need to do the after credits stories;;
that's awesome;;
It is and it isn‚Äôt hahahaha at this point I really want to be done with it;;
Is a great game mind you pretty fun gameplay;;
I really like that üëç;;
Cool;;
I might rent Days Gone and see what that's all about;;
That is not my kind of game;;
After octopath I plan on finishing wolfestain 2;;
I have this bad habit of playing a lot of games at the same time;;
Same;;
oh wolfenstein! nice!;;
I think is a common thing lol;;
My problem with wolfenstein is that it is a FPS so I need to plan my gaming so I take Dramamine beforehand so I don‚Äôt get sick;;
oh that's right;;
i started wolfenstein bad blood lately and after finishing it want to play second;;
I never played the first one;;
This one is pretty cool;;
Love the gameplay and the story which usually shooters are not good at;;
Story I mean;;
Second is so good. So glad wolf and doom went back to roots;;
<@416803598173995018> congrats bro;;
Yeah <@335226291093635072>;;
I've actually just started playing new order;;
I agree <@557380058566623233> , most shooters don't have good stories;;
wadap <@488734758847905803>;;
Yo <@409836692158021632> !;;
Just going on a trip with some friends to say goodbye;;
Before our long trip;;
To the edge of the earth;;
aw that's nice;;
What are your plans this weekend?;;
Skill tree grind for Sekiro;;
Maybe stream with the daughter again üòÇ;;
I do have to say dayz gone is exactly what I wanted so far;;
are you liking it so far <@335226291093635072> ?;;
Very much;;
Good job <@!335226291093635072>, your dongle just grew to 1!;;
I can see some people‚Äôs criticisms of it though;;
But I feel like the drastic state of ‚Äòbad game‚Äô ‚Äòamazing game‚Äô is taking its toll on everyone‚Äôs opinions;;
For example if this game came out 1 year ago it would be amazing, because of things its being compared to;;
ah I hear ya;;
It‚Äôs what I hoped state of decay 2 was going to be;;
So far one review that resounded with me said it‚Äôs open world without the fatigue;;
I agree with that statement 100% doesn‚Äôt have the 10 million collectibles and seems more condensed;;
open world without the fatigue;;
that's actually a really relatable statement;;
I really like that description;;
Not my original words, but it resonated with me as well. As I was feeling the same fatigue;;
yeah I really dig that;;
and I've felt that same fatigue in other games as well;;
So what you playing atm? <@409836692158021632>;;
<@335226291093635072> ;;
Mostly Sekiro;;
prepping for my 2nd playthrough üòÇ;;
Thanks <@448648678224429068>;;

I can't say I don't like any of this kind of games, it's just Im so bad at it i get bored quckly;;
Haha I know the feeling. I tend to dive into these games 10 hours at a time and then skip them for some months and return while still living them;;
It's a complicated relationship;;
"For me it's more ""dropped and never touched again "", but it was when I used to pirate most of games. It's almost first time when I buy this kind of game for full price";;
So it will be shame to drop it;;
True, for some reason I'd want most of these games as portables;;
good morning!!!;;
morning <@557380058566623233>;;
hello <@207416847019016202>;;
weirdest thing for me was when i updated simple 1st tier houses to 2nd tier, and it turned out that farmers disappeared because they have become workers <@87241615671832576>;;
what are you playing today <@557380058566623233> ?;;
damm <@207416847019016202> I started the final mission in Octopath yesterday;;
beat 8 bosses in a row and the one before the last wipe me out;;
Yeahh <@207416847019016202> It actually took a while for me to recognize why my work force was screwed up at one point;;
now I need to start all over because there is no save in between them;;
wow;;
to be honest i have heard not nice things about octopath story...;;
but since i dont have switch, whatever;;
the thing is the story is over after credit rolls <@207416847019016202>;;
but you are right the story is not really that good but the gameplay is;;
so basically upgrade to every new tier fuck up previous. ineresting mechanic <@87241615671832576>;;
well for me its almost never about gameplay <@557380058566623233> ;;
you can judge based on games i stream;;
Anno is like civilisation right? <@87241615671832576> <@207416847019016202>;;
yes I noticed <@207416847019016202>;;
for me too story over gameplay always better;;
i would say anno is more like city builders, like simcity <@557380058566623233>;;
forgive me any simcity fans;;
oh ok;;
no my kind of game to be honest;;
never been mibe too, but now im inerested;;
Not really <@207416847019016202>  ;;
As you said Anno are more a city builder with production and economy;;
not really what?;;
But I find it hard to describe Anno as it's the only series I've found who does what it does.;;
Anno is not like civilisation in my opinion;;
yeah thats what i said;;
its nothing like civilisation;;
city builder with rts elements;;
neither one is my kind do not like builders  and civ types either;;
the longest i ever played in tycoon/management/building type of game was Transport Tycoon. Do you know that one? <@87241615671832576>;;
I do, didn't they just come out with a new iteration or was it just a game which was similar?;;
Anyway in my experience tycoons are a very different experience as well even though they are in the same family;;
that is the thing with games nowadays isn't it they are a big mix of different thing even in the same genre;;
hm i havent heard about new iteration <@87241615671832576>;;
yeah im not big on tycoons too but that one held my attention for long time;;
especially airport part;;
not sure, we can distinct some genres from each other, and they will have all the same things that they had 10-20 years ago <@557380058566623233>;;
like, point clicks, city builders, rts;;
they change, but not so much, you can say that they took everything from other genres;;
they just evolve;;
Indeed <@557380058566623233> it's hard to really define a genre of a game;;
sure we can distinct them but they are never just the genre they are there is always mix with something else;;
like RPGs those are the most difficult to define now;;
look at horizon zero down and zelda breath of the wild. some people say rpg others no;;
let say, for SOME games (as in your example) its a mix of genres, and you cant name one genres. but for some other games its not a problem to define one genre;;
true true I didn't mean to imply all of them of course;;
but is a trend;;
I'd say thos two are pretty much clear RPGs, but I'd argue it also depends on how you play them.;;
for me they are <@87241615671832576> but the argument is there;;
Both are open world and have survival elements but Horizon have a more linear story than Zelda which differentiate them a bit more;;
I guess the problem is there's not really a established definition of genres,  because most of them are made by companies,  which are not interested in being lumped into categories as the games seems less unique yhen;;
Or that's my take;;
and better systems make for a more varied elements able to be introduce;;
"RPGs not a easy example because a lot of games now have rpg elements. But not a lot of games has elements of point clicks, rts, racing, city builders... that what i mean, that when anyone want to say ""genres are hard"", they make an examle of game with rpg elements. but if we will put aside all games witj action/rpg elements, genres are not so hard";;
true true <@207416847019016202>;;
some games have no problem at all;;
summary - rpg elements make genre complicated lol;;
lol;;
It would be an argument indeed. Survival games are very RPG ish but are not really RPGs;;
indeed;;
yeah but i said survival is genre itself;;
oh absolutely;;
it was 5th day of me cooping the forest yesterday;;
another 8-9 hours;;
it was not so fucking terrible as it was week before;;
I though you didn't like it much;;
week ago we finished with our base almost destroyed and even though we loaded save, we were pissed off;;
today I will tackle Wolfenstein;;
i will rest a bit of Octopath after yesterday;;
i didn say that <@557380058566623233> ;;
i wouldnt play its alone for more than 3-4 hours, but with friend its okay;;
ah yes I remember you saying that;;
i can see myself quitting that game 100 times already if i would play alone;;
that it was good with friends;;
"but with friend its like ""lets go to that cave""";;
;;
Hello everyone üòÑ;;

Sounds fun! Day didn‚Äôt start off so well for me I‚Äôm hoping it gets better! <@557380058566623233>;;
sorry to hear that <@524820041976250368>;;
Thank you! <@207416847019016202> it‚Äôs from the wedding I went to;;
<@207416847019016202> thank you üòÑ;;
It‚Äôs okay! <@557380058566623233>;;
what exactly did you do at wedding? <@524820041976250368> ;;
"was you the one who said ""i object! i love groom""?";;
lol;;
Haha nooo! It was my brothers wedding. I helped dj tho it was fun. <@207416847019016202>;;
that is cool <@524820041976250368>;;
by DJ you mean you helped rewind tapes?;;
lol;;
My aunts cousin is gonna teach me all the ropes to dj‚Äôing.  <@557380058566623233> and <@207416847019016202> no I just picked and played music from my cousins playlist.;;
cool;;
I hope you are good at taking jokes <@437092717378404353> because <@207416847019016202> loves to dish them out to us;;
Very much soüòÇ;;
she means i would love to, but since i dont have any, i usualy just shit on everybody;;
that was exactly my point <@207416847019016202>;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
Welcome  <@437092717378404353>;;
royality is here;;
hey <@!498246547838992414>;;
lol;;
Haha hey <@207416847019016202>;;
hey <@!498246547838992414>  how is MK going?;;
i bet its a lot of pain;;
It is going good <@557380058566623233> I love the gameplay;;
it looks like everybody is digging it;;
I think so too, because I think most people just ignore the grinding part;;
i want to say that i enjoyed MK9 story very much. but i kinda got stuck on one fight and decided to hit pause. i have no intention to git gud in fighting;;
Which one? <@207416847019016202>;;
against scorpion and white dude;;
two of them against me;;
and me i think its lu kang;;
Ah yeah, I got stuck on that one too;;
Some fights are pure bullshit;;
yeah;;
i decreased difficulty level;;
but still;;
Yeah, whenever I can't beat a fight I just crouch and block;;
When they get close;;
uppercut;;
hm ill try that too, thanks;;
one question though;;
do you play on gamepad?;;
if yes, what do you use to move? left stick or dpad (or whatever it called);;
I use Dpad;;
Because you don't jump randomly;;
i guessed so;;
because i cant understand how to do all those <- -> on stick;;
It's a bit confusing on stick, I agree;;
I just use dpad because of the jumping on stick;;
I‚Äôm game haha;;
<@557380058566623233> im game for jokes I got a good humor haha;;
Lol good <@437092717378404353>;;
Gooooood morning, everyone!;;
Back from my trip;;
And only 4 days away from my next, giant trip;;
Things have been chaotic as heeell;;
I might only stream one day this week;;
I see you there <@437092717378404353> !;;
Thanks for joining us under the shade of the mango tree!;;
How are you?;;
<@416803598173995018> , great wedding pic! Congratulations;;
You both look happy, great way to start a marriage haha;;
The next days will be crazy. My house is upside down face (bonus points to anyone who gets that reference);;
Good morning <@488734758847905803> ;;
Good morning all!;;
I see you are getting close to the craziness of moving <@488734758847905803>;;
Hey <@557380058566623233> ! How are you?;;
How was your weekend?;;
Yeah I am haha;;
It never feels like there's enough time;;
morning <@557380058566623233> <@488734758847905803>;;
Hey <@207416847019016202> !;;
How was your weekend?;;
"i wonder how many times i need to say ""good"" before people will stop ask me that weird polite question";;
it was good;;
as always;;
Hello <@207416847019016202> you know sometimes is real interest not just politeness lol;;
people with real interest can just read all the chat they missed;;
Mine was hectic, we brought my father back from the hospital and it has been a little complicated but good <@488734758847905803>;;
Lol true <@207416847019016202>;;
i realised that only games that fully take away my attention and ability to pause is some of survival/building games;;
usually i pause games as much as i can;;
played 10 minutes - go do something;;
cant and dont want concentrate;;
but i had 3 games that took my attention fully, and i could stop even for a minute - it were Subnautica, Satisfactory, and now anno 1800;;
Ah that's good that he left the hospital. I hope he's doing well;;
Imagine how long it would take you to beat assassin's Creed Odyssey if you paused every 10 minutes haha;;
I dont need to imagine since i beat all AC games;;
ill just say - a lot;;
"what i mean is im always looking for some ""checkpoints"" that will allow me to pause. it can be change of chapter, change of location, achievement, completed quest, etc.";;
A mango appears <@488734758847905803>;;
"but in games i mentioned above i usually really cant pause, its like ""one more, one more...""";;
hey <@!498246547838992414>;;
Yo <@498246547838992414>;;
Hey bois <@488734758847905803> <@207416847019016202>;;
Oh damn!;;
How long did it take? Haha;;
I didn't peg you as an AC fan;;
Ofc Orange likes AC, he's a soviet assassin;;
well thats what i meant earlier. i did mention several times that i beat all AC and liked all of them;;
AC FAN sounds like some air cooler system;;
lol;;
lets say i wasted all october+november+december on AC odyssey with pause for RDR 2;;
i cant say hours because steam hours are fake - its counts time when game was running but i didnt play;;
and i got a lot of such pauses with every game;;
steam says 340 hours for AC odyssey but i have no idea how much i really played;;
You play the remaster of 3?;;
nope;;
i almost never replay any games;;
so since i played original i dont see point in playing remaster;;
Me either save some select titles;;
Just wondering about that one;;
i love how AC games changed with every game, so for me going back in old one would be not pleasant experience;;
I wanted so much to like that one in specific, but it wasn‚Äôt easy to get around which ruined it for me;;
well to be honest i pretty much loved all games;;
except maybe for 1st, which i didnt  finish;;
I love the changes too, but there‚Äôs that classic appeal to the old games for me;;
it was too boring for me;;
i played 1st one year it came out, and i remember all hype around it;;
Yeah the hype was real;;
I liked it better than revelations;;
But never played unity so I can‚Äôt comment on that;;
i worked for 3 days in some game store, and it was moth before AC release, but everyone came to shop and asked if we have AC;;
Well I did but only like 5 mins of it;;
It looks like you definitely like those builders/survival kind of games then <@207416847019016202>;;
well apparently;;
Any game with a good story I‚Äôm a sucker for;;
but as i said yesterday, its new for me, before that i just dropped them, since i pirated them and didnt care for my money;;
Same <@335226291093635072>;;
Did you like state of decay? <@207416847019016202>;;
didnt play that, only zombie game i care about is dying light;;
well and last of us if its zombie game;;
You may have dug the first one;;
Second one is absent a story;;
Which ruined it for me 100%;;
What‚Äôs the point if there‚Äôs nothing driving you;;
hm i didnt know state of decay 1 had story;;
i played AC unity half a year after its release so i didnt experienced bugs and it was okay for me. i liked how they changed game physics in unity, but i didnt really like where they decided to go with a story;;
Ah;;
Yeah the whole select your episode thing at the beginning ruined it for me;;
Maybe I‚Äôll give it a second chance here sometime;;
im not sure what you mean about select episode. i dont remember, but it was usual AC story;;
i just didnt like that they really didnt dug much in france revolution;;
Oh huh;;
Good job <@!335226291093635072>, your dongle just grew to 3!;;
Maybe it was just a gimmick at the beginning and didn‚Äôt actually mean anything;;
probably yeah;;
i remember some shit about changing ages or something like that, but it wasnt really part of main story;;
Well shit have to try it again now anyways;;
Hey <@335226291093635072> !;;
Sup sup mango;;
and i think i was one of the few who always enjoyed real world story in AC. so i loved desmond story line. and when it ended, im kinda pissed off that in all games after that real world story is just a pointless filler that doesnt make a sense;;
<@207416847019016202> Pedro Rocha played really well this weekend. Even scored a goal;;
haha lol that sneaky brasilian;;
Do anything fun over the weekend <@335226291093635072>;;
Hahaha;;
That son of a bitch;;
Cut up sticks? Does that count?;;
I bet he just didn't like the cold orange;;
Lol sure!;;
Just built a new wood box for the backyard and filled it;;
its counts only if you cut yourself;;
Nice;;
Lmao;;
Now campfires will be in style;;
Played a bunch of days gone too;;
Also agreed about Desmond <@207416847019016202>  ||what a bs way for him to go out||;;
Also if I recall he never really got to be his own assassin;;
Except a tiny bit at the end of 2;;
lets keep out of spoilers;;
what i meant is after him there was not much real world story;;
Sure sure sorry. Figured it was so long ago;;
as i know its because most of players didnt like real world stories at all;;
"like, ""we dont like to play as desmond""";;
and i loved it;;
I really liked playing as Desmond too;;
Me too. Gave focus to the entire ‚Äòwhy‚Äô of it all;;
I wanted to know real-time stuff;;
Yeah same;;
last one with decent real workd story was black flag, that one with 1st person;;
i mean in AC black flag real world stuff was in 1st person;;
and after that i dont remember much because it wasnt much;;
I loved the whole premise of that game too. Abstergo as the good guys etc;;
in last 2 games it was just some chick who almost never left the cave;;
not that i dont like chicks, kassandra for me was best character of the year;;
Morning;;
Sup sup;;
morning;;
How‚Äôs everyone doing today;;
Hehe say ‚Äògood‚Äô orange;;
im good <@314584036339220483>;;
Hey <@314584036339220483> !;;
i see <@335226291093635072>  reads more than 10 lines of chat, for some people its impossible;;
Lmao;;
I lurk in all chats;;
Well excuse me for not going back 50 million lines <@207416847019016202>;;
I‚Äôll be happy once I can play Days Gone;;
no i will not <@488734758847905803>;;
Well then, I'll just send Pedro Rocha back to your team;;
It‚Äôs good for me man <@314584036339220483>;;
i cant really read all chats so i read everyithni in this one and rarely visit others <@335226291093635072>;;
I‚Äôve been sitting here for like 3 mins just listening to this guy play his guitar;;
This chat seems more friendly;;
I usually try and be a part of ACG but they ignore me there lulz;;
its more friendlier when im absent;;
problem is, im always here;;
except when im sleeping (which is not a lot) and when im in vacation in other countries;;
in ACG too many people/messages for my taste. i want to read everything in chat where im active, but there its tough, so i stopped read and chat there;;
Yeah, seems like mainly the same 8 people with new ones every month;;
But the new ones faze out to different new people all the time;;
Like I haven‚Äôt seen Cameron there in a while;;
when you will send  Pedro Rocha back, can you explain to him how to play football? since you talk portuguese naybe he will understand you <@488734758847905803>;;
Lmao;;
They play football in Portugal?;;
I'll trt;;
Try;;
üòú;;
Haha;;
It's Brazilian Portuguese that I speak <@335226291093635072>;;
"Shit we have two ""crims"" now";;
<@498246547838992414> and <@335226291093635072>;;
lets be clear, nobody is have to answer me, and its normal to ignore, and i ignore here a lot of people (mainly what up stuff), but yeah, i had it several times in ACG discord when you join conversation, but sometimes your messages got ignored <@335226291093635072>;;
Yeah <@335226291093635072> that's my problem with the ACG discord there too;;
Like you're talking about relevant stuff to the convo;;
Not that I mind or need attention mind you;;
"and i definitely dont enjoy being ignored. i really pissed of by random ""whats up chat"", but if someone just join conversation, its very cool";;
But what's the point of talking at all if nothing you ever say is acknowledged right?;;
yep;;
thats why i decided to take over this discord server;;
Lol;;
owner here is little bitch, he doesnt mind;;
he loves that actually;;
Or would it be you who's the bitch, since I got someone talking a lot in the discord?;;
Whaaaaat?;;
Lol jk orange;;
Or am I?;;
i didnt get connection between talking a lot and being a bitch, but you definitely know better about those things;;
Language barrier I guess;;
Best I don't explain haha;;
yeah its best for you to be silent <:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
by the way you nailed it at weekend, congrats;;
Hahaha;;
<@488734758847905803> Oh no;;
I have been out crimmed;;
Hahahaha;;
Time to end it all;;
How's school ?;;
It is good;;
Nothing special;;
TRUE;;
I'm hungry;;
Eat boi;;
Nothing special- good name for  <@498246547838992414> autobiography;;
Wow hahaha;;
Sad, but true;;
Sad, but true - name of sequel autobiography book;;
XD;;
I got 12 years old cousin, she recently said to me that 12 years is perfect age for suicide. So you overgrew a little  <@498246547838992414>;;
Now eternal life for you;;
Hahahahaa;;
My god XDDDD;;
Damn tho;;
I don't want to be alive;;
Too late, you should have think better when you were 12;;
*i was happy back then*;;
You wasn't, you just didn't know it yet;;
Dang;;
Wasted opportunity;;
Being alive isn't fun;;
When you will be 70 you will tell your grandchildren what a great opportunity you had at 12;;
Indeed;;
I will tell them:;;
end it now, you won't regret it;;
*Because I regret not doing it*;;
Just don't try to help them do it, or you will go to jail till 90;;
Very true;;
I'll just show them what pills are lethal;;
You can just show them mango karaoke streams;;
Yeah;;
They'll just die on the spot;;
I can't anymore;;
*sadly*;;
Yeah, first time in my life I feel empathy;;
Ok, now it's gone;;
Hahaha;;
If posion expires is it good for you?;;
Yes;;
Or is it worse;;
It's not very healthy to consume expired poison  <@417075583692963840>;;
No, poison is good for you, no matter what date is on it;;
You forgot that It only works when you in belgium;;
yes, we are the fuckers that just won't drop;;
Hey <@488734758847905803> thanks! Still hasnt hit me yet;;
She still didn't hit you?  <@416803598173995018>;;
That means you guys doing really well so far;;
Hey <@417075583692963840>;;
Lol <@416803598173995018>;;

Hello mango;;

*the ceiling* <@488734758847905803>;;
I know the feeling though <@416803598173995018> , takes a while;;
The sky;;
Took me a few years before I stopped calling womango my girlfriend;;
It's too grown up to say wife;;
*wife*;;
Wife is a weird word;;
Wiiiiife;;
Wiiiffffffe;;
*be my wife, or i take your life*;;
Lmao;;
Sounds a lot like my proposal;;
I can imagine;;
No way Womango said yes voulentarily;;
(Jk);;
I'm not that mean;;
Haha;;
We know;;
You're just a buttery butter cup surrounded my crispy jokes;;
Yes;;
I'm a nice boi;;
Yes crim is very nice;;
But edgy = funny;;
Except to dogs;;
Oof, NOT THIS AGAIN;;
Is my guess of what <@417075583692963840> is going to say;;
Do i get to live another day lord crim?;;
Yes, *today* <@417075583692963840>;;
Yay;;

disney russia had forbid any original language copies this time;;
so for me endgame will be pirating when it will be released on disks;;
ah that sucks, Orange;;
Good job <@!409836692158021632>, your dongle just grew to 23!;;
Nice!;;
How was the movie <@409836692158021632> ?;;
Hey <@510594499202908160>;;
Lmao hungOver;;
<@409836692158021632> yeah can‚Äôt wait! Wish we had gotten tickets sooner. Between that and game of thrones last night, my anxiety is through the roof lol;;
Yo <@488734758847905803>;;
loved it <@488734758847905803> ;;
cried a bunch of times;;
üò¢;;
Damnit lol. That‚Äôs not a good sign;;
Feelzbad;;
I just cry a lot <@416803598173995018> ;;
I was just happy to get out of the gulag for once;;
was crying somehow connected to the movie itself? <@409836692158021632>;;
<@207416847019016202> ;;
not related to the movie at all;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170>;;
i thought so;;
Ahh ok lol <@409836692158021632> i didn‚Äôt cry Friday night but Mrs changeover did. I‚Äôm not a big crier lol;;
she cried because shes marrying ex cop. and cops cant be ex;;
<@207416847019016202> messaged me `what's up chat` and I cried;;
Lol <@207416847019016202>;;
"with ""fuck off dude"" follow up <@409836692158021632>";;
How are ya <@416803598173995018>;;
Tired lol;;
You married son of bitch;;
And annoyed that I have to be at work;;
I feel ya;;
Right? Lol still hasn‚Äôt sunk in;;
Yeah that'll take a while;;
Think the biggest thing is, we didn‚Äôt do rings yet. We are doing that in June so that‚Äôs kinda throwing me off;;
i cant come with any humiliating joke about rings;;
let me kill myself and ill be back;;
Lmao;;
Im disappointed orange;;
i know;;
its a shame for a country;;
after week of anus pain i finally managed to launch titanfall 2 with english text and sound <@416803598173995018> <@557380058566623233>;;
oh nice;;
ohhhh;;
nice <@207416847019016202>;;
Sweet! You gonna stream it this week?;;
i want to;;
i dont know though if i want to finish we the revolution first;;
tomorrow my last work day this week due to some national holidays;;
so maybe ill have enough time this week to stream;;
Ahh ok. How close are you to finishing we the revolution?;;
we only played 2 hours so i think im not close;;
at least 2 streams more i think;;
if game is not ridiculously long;;
Oh ok. Finish that first and then do titanfall? Do you have a lot of time this week because of holidays?;;
i will have 100% time. question is how i will use it. i can do some walking with mrs orange, and also im trying to finish The Forest with my friend off stream. and also its better for me to stream at evening, not day, because that way theres more people watching;;
and yeah, i think ill finish revolution first;;
but i want to say, i just watched titanfall 2 intro, and im hyped;;
Ahh ok, little complicated then. Same with me this week, I have no time though lol. Titanfall 2 has a very good campaign. I‚Äôd love to watch you stream it;;
but next week is also only half-working, so i think ill find time for both games;;
also im thinking to stream rise of tomb raider someday;;
i found myself more persisntent in finishing games that i would drop if i played off stream;;
Oh nice. Wish I only had half work lol. I haven‚Äôt played any of the new Tomb raiders or seen any one play them either;;
that make sense <@207416847019016202> because you have an audience;;
i finished first one and played through half of second on xbox one. so on pc it will be from the start;;
that make sense because i have an audience of three of you <@557380058566623233> ;;
who is sleeping when its morning and day for me;;
yeah the difference of time is a killing;;
Yeah the time difference sucks for sure;;
LA sucks;;
Lol yeah a lot of the time it does;;
;;
Lol;;
hello everyone üòÉ <:PM:539114910211112995>;;
hello <@481328139876827138>;;
Hey <@481328139876827138>;;
Lol that photo;;
ayyy <@488734758847905803>;;
After playing a little more I find some Anno 1800 mechanics pretty straightforward. <@87241615671832576> ;;
Like, for example, peoples opinion about pollution doesn't depend on how close houses to factories. It's just island has maximujm amount of factories. If you don't exceed it, you can literally build houses around factories and people will be happy with pollution level. But the moment you build one more factory and exceed limit, that's it, that exact moment people are unhappy with pollution even if all factories are really far far away, at another part if an island;;
In my opinion that kinda takes away from city building;;
Because you don't really need to care about adequate district planning;;
You just need to place buildings like market and fire depot once in a while , so all houses were in area of those buildings;;
yeahh that's very true, it's a pretty dumb thing;;
I was a bit confused about the pollution as well, when I played the Beta;;
Also, I'm not sure, but I think that beauty elements, like trees, also affect all city, not specific district they are placed in. If it's true, then it's also dumb;;
It might be that simplistic made;;
About pollution - I checked it very precisely. Place where you build factory doesn't matter. I sat there and pressed pause/unpause on factory and watched how people were happy/unhappy with pollution;;
It's bit bit of a shame, as it will hurt you production;;
in the long term;;
And if people are unhappy you're soon bankrupt, because it's also pretty straightforward - any disappointment quickly takes away specific amount of people from houses (about 1-2 for every disappointment reason), and of course at that exact moment your income drops;;
Well thing is that pollution mechanic just forces you to explore other islands;;
Because you really can't afford pollution disappointment because of reasons I mentioned above;;
Basically, Also very straightforward - you need every house to be happy with everything, otherwise it won't be full of people, And you will not be able to upgrade it;;
So, you really can't have more than factories limit;;
And I think limit is 4-5;;
I think I am more a fan of the 1402 model for finding Islands. Every Island had different resources. But I guess it's an opinion thing, I still liked the game though and I am still waiting for either a sale or I need to get some Uplay points;;
In 1800 islands also have different resourses;;
I even can't grow tomatoes on main island because soil is not fertile;;
But I didn't play old ones so I don't know what's really different;;
I think it's more of an iteration, which I am all in for.;;
and btw <@207416847019016202> I have gotten the new part of Satisfactory as well;;
Haha I thought so;;
Apparently it's for everyone now;;
Yeahh I don't get it.;;
agree;;
thats stupid;;
for now eipc store is shit;;
Ohh it was like that before, it's not something which makes me more mad.;;
haha yeah;;
Good morning;;
Morning <@488734758847905803>!  üêº;;
Yo <@455797717763883009> !;;
How are ya dude?;;
hey <@488734758847905803> ;;
hey again <@455797717763883009>;;
Doing good buddy!;;
fuck, its holidays ahead of me and apparently i almost got sick;;
Finally out of the holiday mode, and back to work;;
Been playing a bit of Days Gone;;
Damn <@207416847019016202>;;
Have some vitamin c;;
How is the game <@455797717763883009> ?;;
I'm liking it so far! Bit slow in the beginning. But gets better as you play it.;;
Felt like Mad Max X Last of Us;;
oh yeah i thought of mad max too when i listened to some reviews;;
and i liked mad max;;
played the shit out of that boring post apoc;;
Hm interesting;;
I still haven't played mad max;;
I need to give it a shot;;
Yeah Mad Max was fun!;;
Repetitive but it was fun nonetheless;;
And the environment when I rains is the best part of the game. And riding your bike;;
Also Wolfenstein 2 is rumoured to hit Gamepass this week;;
its repetative if you want to do all it got;;
same as odyssey;;
TRUE;;
I hope they fix the framerate drop though;;
you mean in days gone? <@455797717763883009>;;
Yup  <@207416847019016202>;;
Good job <@!455797717763883009>, your dongle just grew to 20!;;
is it bad?;;
i mean, does it happen often?;;
Only when you're riding through a horde of zombies;;
Or in an infested area;;
Only when riding the bike though;;
It's fine if you're walking;;
Aye it's better on the Pro;;
well fuck pro;;
Good morning!;;
morning <@557380058566623233>;;
Hey <@207416847019016202>;;
i wanted to stream today but im not so sure now, not feeling very well, i think i got sick;;
not much for now, but still;;
Oh I am sorry to hear you are sick <@207416847019016202> don‚Äôt worry about streaming get better first;;
Morning all;;
Hey <@557380058566623233>;;
Yo <@416803598173995018> !;;
Hello guys <@488734758847905803> <@416803598173995018>;;
Morning <@488734758847905803> and <@557380058566623233> how are you doing today?;;
morning <@416803598173995018>;;
sorry to hear you dont feel well <@207416847019016202>;;
fuck you guys saying sorry to me;;
Just starting the day. I hope it will be a quiet one;;
i can tolerate when you do it to other people;;
but to me, ew;;
please dont do it;;
Lol we won‚Äôt but will still think it;;
Lmao;;
Sorry <@207416847019016202>;;
But you deserve to be sick;;
Lol jk;;
How's that?;;
i wont even say fuck you because its implied every time i write to you <@488734758847905803>;;
Harsh haha;;
im so sorry orange;;
i truly feel pity for you and how you arent feeling well, im sorry;;
<@207416847019016202>;;
lol;;
Hahaha;;
That makes him sicker;;
We can thusly defeat him!;;
you cant;;
yeah like mango said, im glad you're sick;;
did one of your fuses blow?;;
you can pity everyone you will encounter, and it still will not help defeat orange;;
i dont pity lol, just sucks to be sick is all;;
"you just said ""i truly feel pity for you """;;
thats what i meant;;
I was being sarcastic cause you said dont say sorry lol;;
sarcastic i like;;
Missed both my busses yeet;;
its better if you were sarcastic all the time, without sorrying;;
will you die alone at bus stop? <@!498246547838992414>;;
No, it's at the train station where there are people;;
I wish death upon myself though;;
I love sarcasm <@207416847019016202>;;
hey <@!498246547838992414>;;
in order for me being empathic at least once a day, i wish death to you too <@!498246547838992414>;;
Hello <@!498246547838992414>;;
We don‚Äôt pity you <@207416847019016202> is just that being sick sucks;;
Don‚Äôt die <@!498246547838992414> we will miss your name changes;;
it sucks when its you, when its other people, fuck them;;
lmao;;
Lol we can‚Äôt win <@416803598173995018>;;
lol I think its funny;;
Oof, hey  <@557380058566623233> <@416803598173995018>;;
what if Mrs Orange is sick though? <@207416847019016202>;;
hey <@!498246547838992414> how you been?;;
My Name will be 1 final change;;
Deadsedate;;
I have been well except missing all busses <@416803598173995018>;;
why you missing buses?;;
You overslept <@!498246547838992414>;;
I'm leaving school lol <@557380058566623233>;;
we discussed it already <@416803598173995018> ;;
if mrs orange is sick im empathetic because of my responsibility towards her, not because i generally feel for everyone who suffers;;
Oh shiet true hahahahaha <@!498246547838992414>;;
I forgot you are in the afternoon already;;
hes missing busses because hes not very smart <@416803598173995018>;;
<@416803598173995018> because I go to school in Hoeselt and I need to take the bus to Bilzen station and sometimes traffic will cause me to miss my bus;;
It's always either good in time, or barely missed them;;
ahh ok <@207416847019016202> that makes sense;;
so just leave earlier <@!498246547838992414>;;
interacting with people in real life, especially living with them, put some obligations on you, so i cant just ignore them. but when it comes to other people who not near me, i dont feel any kind of empathy, because its not up to me to help;;
You can't though <@416803598173995018>;;
"I can relate <@207416847019016202> I have a hard time ""feeling sorry"" for anyone, but I always say I feel sorry or empathic towards people as to not sound like an ass";;
well that means you as hypocritic as everyone else here, you just can admit you dont give a fuck;;
others will say they are REALLY sorry;;
You know one can be really sorry <@207416847019016202> because is someone we at least interact with at a daily basic;;
In this case you;;
Well it's not that I don't give a fuck, I just have a hard time feeling something for someone else <@207416847019016202>;;
well thank you <@557380058566623233> ;;
but i look at sickness as a factor, not as a bad thing;;
Mmm interesting;;
but i think its in a culture. for example, russian language is really dont have this habbit to response empathically when someone is sick. of course people feel empathy, but theres no generic phrase for that;;
why cant you leave earlier? <@!498246547838992414>;;
I like being sick, there's always a chance of death;;
<@416803598173995018> because school doesn't allow it;;
Oh that is interesting;;
ahhh I see;;
And there's no earlier bus to the station <@416803598173995018>;;
so dont go to school;;
<@416803598173995018> good idea;;
"when you say you sick here, people start saying ""get well"", but in more directive manner, like ""go take meds"", similar to what mango said";;
I think Americans are way to emphatic about everything and I think is cultural;;
yeah and in 90% of cases its just hypocrisy <@557380058566623233>;;
thats why i despise that so much;;
Yes true;;
I'd rather have nobody care that I was sick and I just rot away in my room, rather than people feeling sorry for me;;
But in my particular case when I say sorry is because I hate being sick, which is not often thank god, and I do not wish that on anyone;;
I don‚Äôt like people feeling sorry either but I do hope someone care;;
I don't think being sick is all that bad, except when you have shit to do <@557380058566623233> like when I had bronchitis, I had a LOT to do and I had to catch up the next weeks of school and that was literally hell;;
<@!498246547838992414> same;;
if you just drop out of school, then when you get sick it wont matter;;
I'd rather if something happen to me that people ignore it completely, rather than give me pity;;
I cannot stand that shit;;
"interesting about ""but I do hope someone care"" <@557380058566623233> ";;
i think i really dont.;;
"what i mean, i can very well guess about who cares about me and who doesnt, and i understand that when you and <@416803598173995018>  saying sorry to me, its way more real than some ""wasupchat"" moron";;
but its already there- i mean, somebody do care, its not something that will change depending on do i hope on that or not. so i kinda take it as default.;;
like, someone cares, ok;;
Yes I agree <@207416847019016202>;;
"I can get people saying ""get well soon"" and stuff";;
That's good;;
Yes. I think we are all on the same page here in one way or the other;;
Yeah;;
I just hate when people give me positive attention;;
It's weird I know;;
"But I'd rather have someone say ""I hope you die of your illness"" than ""Oh is there anything I can do for you?""";;
i'd rather no one say anything to me;;
When i die ;;
I want someone to smoke my ashes;;
Yeah that I like the best too <@207416847019016202>;;
That would be epic;;
No, snort <@417075583692963840>;;
Yikes the trailer for the sonic the hedgehog movie is out and to say it looks bad, is an understatement;;
Yes;;
Someone should snort my ashes;;
What did you expect  <@416803598173995018> it is fecking sonic;;
Sonic has sucked for years;;
True. I just still associate sonic with the originals that I loved so much;;
Was hopeful they‚Äôd bring it back to that lol. Boy was I wrong;;
They are very good;;
A movie about video games normally doesn't work out well;;
Very true unfortunately;;
True, game movies sucks;;
That is because all of them make the same mistakes;;
They want to do like the video game. Instead they should take the characters and premises and do something different;;
Well Assassins Creed did that. And people was angry about it not being Assasin's Creed.;;
"what i think is they should do good movie first. theres no right recipe, like ""do it more like game or less like game""";;
its usually just shitty movies;;
Yeahh, I still look forward to Detectice Pikachu,  even though it's not a pure games franchise.;;
But the producers of Sonic are also the fast and the furious producers,  so there kind of no surprise. I don't get the uproar.;;
hey <@159985870458322944>;;
can i grow my dongle?;;
please;;
you little bitch;;
I think the AC movie was one he best of the lot <@87241615671832576>;;
But agree with <@207416847019016202> they are just bad movies;;
To me, videogame movies can't be good and aren't. Which make me enjoy them even more. World of Warcraft was good to me because they kind of destroyed the lore and rebuilt it for newcomers. I kind of got some Lord of the Rings feelings toward it as well because of the adventure and the unknown.;;
Probably the one example of a good video game movie;;
Good job <@!335226291093635072>, your dongle just grew to 4!;;
Oh yes I forgot about wow, it wasn‚Äôt that bad;;
Well I didn't like a.c. movie and wow movie both;;
Good job <@!207416847019016202>, your dongle just grew to 37!;;
Thanks moron  <@159985870458322944>;;
Yeahh, divisive movies;;
Lol MEE6 does not love you <@207416847019016202>;;
He doesnt;;
Sonic just  isns't. You have to remember Sonic original was designed as a Marketing tool.;;
I think he is jealous of the orange bot;;
So he's just going full circle üòâ;;
Orange bot soon will do ratings too;;
It will only rate rudeness.;;
Yeah good idea;;
-100 points for everyone who is sorry;;
Lol;;
haha;;
Or asks how your weekend went: -1000;;
Yep;;
And negative points multiply;;
Lmao;;
;;
Check it;;
Another tattoo?;;
Yes;;
I hope this one will be on your anus;;
So I can have an excuse to show you?;;
I know you really want to see it, but I just don't feel that way about you;;
So I can insert something in tiger mouth;;
I'm sorry and I hope we can still be friends;;
We never could;;
*gasp* lies!;;
Orange Mango bot the ying and yang in positive and negatives measured through your conversations;;
Mangobot should never be a thing;;
Orangebot or no bot at all;;
Yeah;;
OrangeBot or not to bot;;
how much are tattoos generally in Brasil? <@488734758847905803>;;
Oh, prices in different countries, my favourite part;;
lol I am just curious;;
<@488734758847905803> really though, you shouldnt get that tattoo. Instead you should get one of orange;;
Yeah, I hate tattoos only because no one do tattoos with my pic;;

I've tried...;;
Mango doesn't accept that kind of D...;;
Yeah, he is very straight forward in that matter... only one kind of Ds;;
Big Ds;;
Funny paradox - straightforward but not straight;;
Big Ds, little Ds, medium sized Ds...all the Ds;;

Hello <@409836692158021632>;;
hello <@557380058566623233> ;;

<@488734758847905803>  I like that design a lot;;
Doing good so far thanks. And you? <@409836692158021632>;;
doing good <@557380058566623233> ;;
having discussions (aka arguments) about Endgame and Game of Thrones at work coz we are all nerds here at the office üòÇ;;
Sounds like a nice office to work at;;
it's ok most of the time;;
but of course there are a few guys who take it too far;;
that's when I show them a picture of Orange to put fear in their souls;;
Lol;;
No one is really a fan of that stuff where I work. Well not my office, the main office yes but I‚Äôm never there;;
Lol;;
Working with boring people is the worst;;
Or not having anything in common;;
Lol yeah I agree. Lot of that where I am now. That‚Äôs why I just keep to myself a lot;;
Don't you love it when someone spoils endgame for you?;;
BECAUSE I SURE AS HELL DON'T APPRECIATE IT;;
Please don‚Äôt spoil anything lol. I‚Äôm seeing it Thursday night;;
I'm not spoiling anything;;
But it got spoiled for me;;
Bastards.;;
I‚Äôm staying off a lot of social media for that reason;;
Yeah that is a bastard thing to do;;
Smart;;
But the bastards from irl spoiled it for me;;
That sucks;;
There were assoles running around shouting spoilers;;
sorry to hear that <@498246547838992414> ;;
<:Orange:545555843978887170> `fake american sympathy`;;
Oof;;
`real belgian anger at endgame spoiler people`;;
with little filipino mix;;
*the teletubbies die in endgame*;;
but seriously...sorry somebody spoiled it for you <@498246547838992414> ;;
I would send Liam Neeson's after them if I could;;
Yes;;
Do it;;
I've heard he has a specific set of skills...;;
Not a big spoiler, just an annoying one that ruins the movie;;
Still don't say it please;;
For next few months;;
any and all spoilers will be deleted by Orange;;
and he will show up at your house;;
"and show you his ""specific set of skills""";;
<@207416847019016202> I'm not gonna be a spoiling twat;;
<@409836692158021632> Specific set of *dongles*;;
ill need mango to help me with that. his skills are more deep;;
üôÑ;;
But your dongle is bigger <@207416847019016202>;;
You can *use* it better;;
good times are coming...;;
"recently in russia was established new law, called something like ""about fake news and insult of government""";;
which is basically means that you now can be officially sued for saying anything bad about government;;
"it was launched several days ago and 1 person already sued (500 bucks fine, minimum by that law) for posting in social network post saying something like ""putin is a fantastic moron""";;
;;
"also, now government developing ""independent internet"" which they say are only for moment when US will decide to cut off russia from internet, but everyone thinks its for better control over people, but nothing clear about if government is really plan to cut off us from global internet or they will just do something like great china firewall";;
Wow that doesn't sound good at all;;
yes it doesnt;;
part about internet worries me more;;
unfair jail time is a thing for long time now, so who cares;;
That's alot of control on the people of the country;;
i dont think there was any time in russia without strict control;;
maybe 90s;;
but it was terrible in terms of safety;;
a lot of criminality;;
most freedom;;
and after that now its very safe here, but again a lot of control;;
I wish people that lived here in the USA where a little more educated about how it's like in other countries;;
well i think every country does a lot of forceful misinformation;;
US and UK media talks fake shit about russia, russian media talks shit about US and UK;;
and most of that is really shit, but many people believe;;
also, its hard to know how it is in other countries unless you know someone from there;;
So true this one of the reasons i love coming to discord to chat with you folks;;
I fucking love eBay sometimes! I just got an item for half price that I will need when I get my new setup for streaming! It‚Äôs brand new too;;
Nice!;;
Evening fellas üêº;;
hey <@455797717763883009>;;
Yo  <@409836692158021632> how you been buddy?;;
doing good, sir! how's Days Gone?;;
It has its downs. But I'm loving it at the moment;;
ah very nice;;
Hey <@455797717763883009> how you been?;;
Yo  <@416803598173995018>;;
Congratulations man! üòÉ;;
Saw the picture on twitter;;
Thanks man! Still planning the ceremony over in France and honeymoon in Lake Como. We really wanted to take train there but it would take forever so we are just going to fly now;;
Hello <@455797717763883009>;;
Flies inside Europe are pretty cheap <@416803598173995018>;;
Oh yeah super cheap. Most expensive we saw was about 40 euros. Yet another reason we want to move there lol so we can travel for cheap;;
Nice!  <@416803598173995018> double check on the baggage policy though;;
Hey  <@557380058566623233>;;
How's it going?;;
Do they usually charge for baggage?;;
My little brother once flew from Las Palmas in theCanary Island of Spain to Paris for 2euros;;
Depends of the airline;;
Wow lol. That‚Äôs crazy;;
You get just one carry on bag. Like a small backpack or a bag. Nothing big.;;
You can‚Äôt check anything?;;
I am doing good thanks <@455797717763883009>;;
You get a cabin suitcase with priority check-in;;
Anything more you'll need to pay extra;;
Small airlines usually charge for every bag;;
Ahh ok good to know, thanks! We will both have one large suitcase and a carry on most likely;;
Yeah that makes sense if it‚Äôs a small airline and small plane;;
It's better if you pay for the extra suitcase online, cheaper than doing it at the airport;;
Ok good to know, thanks! Appreciate it man;;
Check out @XboxGamePass‚Äôs Tweet: https://twitter.com/XboxGamePass/status/1123234596244508672?s=09;;
damn, gamepass is so good right now...;;
Yeah and I just pre-ordered Jedi Fallen Order. Lol;;
Anyone here know anything about routers or WiFi?;;
<@455797717763883009> I really hope that game is good;;
I hope so too;;
And it was 30% off on Amazon. So couldn't resist;;
Oh wow. How‚Äôd you get that deal?;;
Think it's in Europe. Even other retailer had the same discount;;
Everyone apart from GameStop üòÇ;;
Lol of course not them;;
That‚Äôs a good deal though;;
Yes 49.99 instead of 69.99;;
And I don't get charged until it ships. So it's cool;;
Even better;;
Looking forward to see more of it during E3;;
And I think they're planning to tie up with Xbox to promote the game;;
You'll be in Como during E3 ?;;
Yeah definitely and yeah I‚Äôll be in como then;;
Sweet!;;
Hopefully I can go to E3 one year;;
Yeah, it's easier for you;;
I got you next year <@416803598173995018>;;
You the man <@409836692158021632>;;
Oh gosh!!! I just saw the sonic trailer! Someone needs to steal this movie so it never comes out! Lmao;;
it's soooo.....horrible ü§¢;;
Lol ya it‚Äôs awful. I cringed watching it and couldn‚Äôt even finish;;
It is so bad is hilarious;;
Dear Lord what were they thinking;;
<@488734758847905803> Thank you so much üòÉ;;
Good job <@!437092717378404353>, your dongle just grew to 1!;;

Zenith;;
i think <@488734758847905803> might like it;;
theres a lot of jokes, maybe he will learn some;;
Oh cool;;
Yeah yeah;;
You're lucky Pedro Rocha hates the cold;;
for those in chat who has no idea who the fuck Pedro Rocha is - its another shitty brasilian;;
but hes worse than <@488734758847905803>;;
Does he whine like Neymar and mango?;;
no, he just was total shit when he played for a team i root for;;
and after that he is suddenly good in brasil;;
Ahh ok, whats the team you root for?;;
That has happened to me before with American football lol. Player sucks on my favorite team but is good with another or they were good with one team and suck with mine;;
spartak moscow;;
Good afternoon everyone!;;

Because the new emperor just took the trone;;
https://media.giphy.com/media/kxy8p8sFcoR5m/giphy.gif;;

Of course is the older monarchy on earth . But it is representative only;;
Like all the monarchys nowadays;;
Yeah, our king doesn't do anything actually;;
But Japanese are the only ones that change the calendar;;
They start from day 1 every new monarch;;
That's interesting;;

Feeling better <@207416847019016202> ?;;

Lol;;
Ah there it is;;
<@207416847019016202> <@488734758847905803> I have a question /doubt;;
If you don‚Äôt mind me asking;;
Is about the !so command in stream;;
ask;;
Of course;;
When you use it should the name of the person be used with the @ in the name or without it?;;
i thinks it depends on bot;;
It depends on how the person wrote their command too I believe;;
yeah;;
In mine, it's without;;
in mangos ints without;;
I see ok thanks guys;;
i didnt even set up this command;;
no support from my channel bitches;;
Hahahaa;;
You lil fok;;
Lol of course you didn‚Äôt;;
im lazy but not little;;
fucking obs today decided to lose all my scene settings;;
another way to piss me off;;
Damn;;
I hate that;;
Sorry you lost me here what is a obs?;;
software that allows you to stream from pc;;
Ohhh;;
Good job <@!557380058566623233>, your dongle just grew to 18!;;
Ohhh 18 already;;
all those things like what game i stream, where i put camera on screen, wheres alerts, wheres chat - it all managed from obs scenes;;
sounds level also;;
Ok but isn‚Äôt that set on your pc?;;
so it all lost;;
it all sets in obs settings;;
and obs lost those settings;;
You mean like in the stream service?;;
That sucks;;
i mean obs is a PROGRAM on my pc;;
and this fucking program lost my fucking settings;;
sound level, mono/stereo, camera settings, alerts..;;
I thought that once a program is set up it remains like that unless the user changes it;;
of course;;
Sorry I am totally stupid when it comes to pc stuff;;
thats why i complaining;;
because for some reason it suddenly gone;;
Ohhh weird;;
"Morning all, so can we rename discord to ""The Orange Tree"" now that mango will be gone for awhile?";;

She doesn‚Äôt have her own screename?;;
Haha hey <@488734758847905803>;;

Same with Mrs Orange;;
She's always like remind me please wtf is that;;
lol yep, Mrs Changeover doesnt get it at all hahaha;;
Hey <@335226291093635072> , I did!;;
They're all at my aunt's house waiting for me to go put them together on Saturday or Sunday;;
<@467974634977886220> is better than your SO's cause she's in here;;
Suck it <@207416847019016202> and <@416803598173995018> !;;
"Also every time when I watch mango stream, Mrs Orange is like ""who's that moron""";;
Sounds accurate;;
Oh wait no, it's me who saying that;;
Even more accurate;;
Maybe its worse that shes here though <@488734758847905803> cause then she sees how weird you are and how youre basically in love with me and then she leaves you;;
Hahaha;;
Do you think I can hide my weirdness in everyday life?;;
While Mrs Changeover is not here and doesnt know anything that happens here so she cant judge me lol;;
I'm honestly less weird here;;
Not even joking;;
hahahaha;;
Lmao;;
oh boy, cant wait to meet you! lol;;
Hahaha;;
Yeah I think I said in a stream once how when I was a kid in the states people called me weird;;
"Then when I moved to Brazil I was like ""guess who's not gonna be called weird anymore?""";;
But then everyone called me weird;;
It transcended nations;;
So I accepted myself as a freak;;
And I like it;;
actually you kno what? Im busy the days youll be here....;;
Hahaahah;;
Why did you move to brazil mango?;;
I have the flu that day;;
lmao;;
<@417075583692963840> , cause my grandma was sick and she lived here. We thought she wasn't going to make it, but then she did and we ended up not leaving;;
orange cant accept himself because robots arent self aware. Unless its like skynet.....then we are fucked;;
Brazilians are awesome;;
Oh ok that makes sense;;
It's the economy and corruption that fuck the country up;;
Lmao;;
Orange is gonna be like Arnold and turn against his machine brethren;;
oh god i summoned him;;
What have you done?!;;
Oh I'm very self aware. And have no troubles accepting myself. It's the other people who I hate;;
hahahahaha;;
You can't summon what's always here;;
Same;;
I hate people lol;;
but I like myself;;
That's not what you said to me or Mrs changeover you dick;;
!;;
I hate you mango;;
I like Mrs changeover;;
lol jk;;
Well I never!;;
I hate mrs changeover and like you;;
*takes off kid gloves and leaves*;;
Lmao;;

Hahaha;;
Would she really?;;

Haha;;
Nice;;

Ah good;;

That's what I told womango;;
when we got married friday, I told her my dad took my car keys so I couldnt leave. I said this when were like sitting up there an it had already started lol;;
I wasnt lying, he really did take them;;

Are there other oranges in your life?;;
Mornin' <@409836692158021632>;;
there WERE other, smaller oranges but now they all hide in shame in the presence of your orange glory;;
Orange is an *alpha male*;;
"I found it very inconvenient that in english there's no gender in word ""cousin"".";;
"In Russian it's like ""cousin brother"" and ""cousin sister"", so it's always clear";;
Meh, I know another word for cousin;;
*wife*;;
Pervert alert;;
hello <@!498246547838992414> ;;
*cousin wife*;;
Not pervert, incest <@207416847019016202>;;

Incest is wincest as they say;;
I don't want to judge but isn't incest kinda pervertion?;;
I don't think so;;
That's what your sister told you?;;
Jokes on you;;

Hallo everyone;;
hey solo;;
wow, apparently due to change of windows, i lost one important OBS setting - to record my game automatically when i stream. so it will be the fisrst strem i will have no recording of <@557380058566623233>;;
most of other settings were in place, so i didnt check this one;;
Oh that sucks;;
Hello <@329001373670572044>;;
How long have you been streaming <@207416847019016202>;;

Hello everyone;;
hey <@87241615671832576> , what are you playing these days?;;
Been playing assassin's creed origins. Still trying to get the stream motivation going again :);;
How about you?;;
hm, origins...;;
i played Zenith off stream (fun game with humour), and we the revolution on stream;;
Ohh yeahh I did see that. What are your thoughts?;;
good game;;
reminds me this is the police;;
that's great;;
Good morning everyone;;
Can't talk much today, but just wanted to let everyone know that womango and I have arrived safely at my aunt's house;;
Hope everyone is doing well;;
And I'll see you guys soon!;;
hey <@488734758847905803> happy to hear you guys are good;;
good afternoon everyone!;;
<:discordok:293495010719170560> <:Orange:545555843978887170> <:discordok:293495010719170560>;;
hey <@207416847019016202>;;
I missed your stream today;;
haha its ok;;
you missed some huge story stuff;;
i will catch you up next time;;
cool thanks;;
not sure about next time, it will be either tomorrow or monday;;
i hope is tomorrow dead day for me lol;;
yeah, i think it will be tomorrow;;
yeiiii!!!!;;
morning all!;;
Morning  <@557380058566623233>;;
good morning <@207416847019016202> feeling better?;;
Yeah of course;;
good!;;
I have another discord question if you don't mind me asking? <@207416847019016202>;;
of course;;
thanks!;;
I was checking settings;;
and it says you can link your discord account to your twich account;;
and others;;
i was curious about the advantage of doing so;;
do you guys usually do it?;;
<@207416847019016202>;;
i do, but only thing it gives me is a displaying when i stream;;
I see;;
So is basically for streaming and that kind of stuff;;
Thanks! <@207416847019016202>;;
i guess that its also allows you to join discord of people you subbed to but im not sure;;
and to be clear, i have no idea who these people are, i subbed to them only because of someone gifted it to me;;
ok I see, so you can do certain activities related to your twich;;
yep;;
i guess it is worth it if you stream but if you don't not that much;;
ok my other question is regarding the voice channels;;
<@207416847019016202>;;
people use it to chat that is obvious;;
you just click on it and are active or you need some setting done;;
i am guessing you need a microphone in your pc;;
haha yeah, if you want people to hear you you need a mic;;
i am usually on my ipad so I dont know if it works on it;;
if mic already set up, probably it will work;;
well if ipad has a mic maybe it will work too;;
i dont know;;
phone is easy because it is what it is for lol;;
so you just click on it and you are in the lounge and that's it;;
yep;;
ok cool lol;;
i am sometimes amaze by all the thinks technology wise and then I watch my 10 year old niece clicking on her ipad like nobody's business, you know like it is so natural for her <@207416847019016202>;;
Thanks for your help <@207416847019016202> as always lol you are great help;;
to be honest for me its natural too;;
i had some kind of tech most of my life;;
you belong to this technological generation too;;
I still remember when we have a black and white tv and phones have dial up and did nothing but calls lol;;
now you do everything except call people lol;;
well i used black and white tv too;;
and of course phones that have dial;;
and spent most of my childhood without phone;;
but still...;;
then you are closer to my generation;;
i have a military friend that had one of the first portable phones there were. It freking looked like a brig lol;;
and also if you wanted to make an international phone call from your house phone you needed to connect with an operator first;;
i remember my class mate used some mobile phone in 99, which was more like radio phone;;
and he used operator too i think;;
in my city gsm mobile phones started spreading only in 2002;;
Here in Dominican we have always adapted technology pretty fast because there is a small percentage of the population with a lot, and I mean a lot of money;;
so there was mobile phones by 2000 already;;
I mean the ones everybody uses;;
those radio types were mostly use by military and such;;
after soviet fell there was no foreign technologies in russia at first, so in 90s we got few things, mostly old, like for example fake china copy of first NES;;
but closer to 2000+, it started to even out, and we started to receieve new techologies same day;;
oh wow;;
here we have always have a big American (as in the USA)  influences so we have mostly everything that comes out there here;;
well now we too;;
in soviet it wasnt like that;;
and 90s were kinda transition;;
yes I remember the time,  I mean you know the news of the fall of the soviet union and the Gorbachov era and the transition. It was pretty big news at the time, I was living in Spain back then;;
I can only try to imaging what it was for you guys;;
for me it was some unclear shit on tv, i was too small to understand;;
but i remember 90s well;;
lol I imagine;;
I have fond memories of the 90s it was my twenties years lol;;
same with me and 00s;;
in 90s in russia in your 20s you had very good chances to be killed;;
i can imagine it was a difficult time;;
thank you <@557380058566623233> for being there during all 7 hours of stream;;
also thanks <@!498246547838992414> and <@!565460806448185344> for nice chat;;
that game is fucking huge;;
who would have thought;;
it was great <@207416847019016202> thank you!;;
TRUE;;
